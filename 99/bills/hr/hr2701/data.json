    "text": "Plan Termination and Reversion Control Act of 1985 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to revise provisions relating to terminations of single-employer plans and reversions to employers resulting from such terminations. Prohibits mergers and consolidations of pension plans and transfers of plan assets or liabilities if any act or failure to act in accomplishing the merger, consolidation, or transfer violates the fiduciary duty of the employer under specified provisions (which provide that the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable administrative expenses of the plan). Sets forth provisions for fiduciary responsibility: (1) for meeting specified requirements relating to distribution of residual assets upon termination of a single-employer plan; and (2) in connection with related plans following single-employer plan terminations. Makes it unlawful for any individual who is a party in interest, as described under specified provisions, in connection with a single-employer plan to exert undue influence on or cause a material misrepresentation to a plan fiduciary, with the intent to initiate or facilitate a plan termination in order to entrench or otherwise protect the status of such individual. Authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the Corporation) to assess a civil penalty against any person who commits such a violation. Limits the maximum amount of such penalty to five percent of the amount of any distribution from the plan to the employer pursuant to specified provisions. Makes such person also personally liable to make good to any aggrieved participant or beneficiary their losses resulting from such violation. Makes liability for any such violation joint and several. Authorizes the Corporation to seek: (1) injunctions against any act or practice constituting such a violation; or (2) other appropriate equitable relief to redress such violations or to enforce such requirements. Places limitations on distributions of residual assets to employers after single-employer plan terminations. Provides that those residual assets of the plan which are attributable to employee contributions shall be equitably distributed to the employees who made such contributions (or their beneficiaries) in accordance with their rate of contributions, in a specified manner. Provides that the remaining residual assets be available for distribution as follows: (1) 50 percent to participants and beneficiaries as compensation for unpaid constructive cost-of-living increases; and (2) 50 percent to participants who are within five years of normal retirement age under the plan. Provides for adjustments to the amounts of residual assets distributable to participants and beneficiaries through: (1) proration of available assets; (2) reallocation of excess available assets; and (3) adjustment to ensure equitable distribution. Provides that, only after all of the above requirements for distribution of residual assets to participants and beneficiaries have been met, any remaining residual assets shall be distributed to the employer if: (1) such distribution does not contravene any applicable Federal or State law; and (2) the plan has, since its establishment, provided explicitly for such a distribution in these circumstances. Gives plans in effect on the date of enactment of this Act 60 days after such date to contain such an explicit provision. Requires such plans to notify in writing each employee or retiree who qualifies as an interested party of the proposed plan amendment incorporating such provision at least 30 days before its adoption. Sets forth a special rule for distributions to employers in cases of transfers of coverage to other plans. Requires that any other residual assets of the plan, which remain after the above requirements for distribution to participants and beneficiaries are met and which are not distributable to employers because of the above requirements, be distributed to participants and beneficiaries in a specified manner. Directs the Corporation to issue regulations for such distributions of residual assets, including provision of consideration of administrative costs to the plan. Authorizes the Corporation to waive any such requirements, individually or by class, upon its determination that such administrative costs reader the distribution impracticable. Provides for increased availability to employers of residual assets upon certification of business necessity. Provides that a plan termination is a business necessity if it meets the requirements of: (1) a special rule for certain terminations incident to the sale of a business for fair value to an unrelated party; or (2) certain distress requirements. Provides that such distress requirements are met if the plan termination meets the conditions set forth in at least one of the following categories: (1) recent funding waivers; (2) liquidation in bankruptcy proceedings; (3) inability to pay debts and continue in business; and (4) unreasonably burdensome pension costs caused by a declining workforce (but not in the case of substantial layoffs). Precludes a business necessity determination: (1) where the primary purpose is to finance corporate take-overs; or (2) in the case of recently established plans, i.e. plans which have not completed five years. Revises ERISA provisions relating to the termination of single-employer plans to require 60 days' advance written notice to the plan participants and their beneficiaries before the plan administrator files a notice with the Corporation that the plan is to be terminated on a proposed date. Revises IRC provisions relating to plan qualification to set forth a five-year disqualification rule for replacement plans where plan termination is not a business necessity. Makes exceptions to such rule for derivative or successor plans which meet certain conditions. Places various limitations on the availability, after various types of employer reversions (i.e. employer acceptance of residual assets of a terminated plan pursuant to various requirements of this Act), of: (1) funding waivers for replacement plans; and (2) extensions of amortization periods for comparable plans. Requires faster funding for replacement plans after employer reversions. Provides that an alternative minimum funding standard is not available while such plans are subject to such faster funding requirement. Revises IRC provisions (relating to excise taxes in connection with qualified pension, etc., plans) to add an excise tax on reversions to employers upon termination of single-employer plans. Requires the employer to pay such tax in the amount of ten percent of the fair market value of the residual assets so distributed to the employer. Revises ERISA requirements relating to employer securities acquired or held by plans. Provides that, by specified dates and under certain conditions, a plan may not hold: (1) any employer security which is not qualifying employer stock; or (2) any qualifying employer stock to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of employer securities held by the plan exceeds five percent (currently ten percent) of the plan's assets. Provides for regulations requiring plans to divest themselves of 50 percent of their holdings of employer securities and employer real property by a specified deadline (in order to comply with the five percent limitation). Defines \"qualifying employer stock\" as an employer security which: (1) is stock in the employer; (2) does not constitute, and is not acquired subject to, any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness; and (3) is not subject to any restriction on marketability or voting power applicable by reason of its acquisition by a plan. Directs the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries to conduct a study of the reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, for each of the various types of pension plans, which are appropriate for use by enrolled actuaries and others under ERISA and IRC in determining the actuarial status and funding requirements of such plans. Requires the Joint Board, within two years after enactment of this Act, to: (1) complete such study and report, with recommendations, to specified congressional committees; and (2) prescribe by regulation appropriate procedures for determining, for each type of plan, such appropriate actuarial assumptions and methods; and (3) determine such actuarial assumptions and methods for each type of pension plan in accordance with such procedures and publish such assumptions and methods in the Federal Register. Authorizes the Joint Board to: (1) revise by regulation the prescribed procedures; and (2) publish revised reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods for each type of plan. Requires the termination of enrollment of enrolled actuaries if they fail to use such prescribed assumptions and methods. Set forth requirements relating to the voting rights of participants in employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) to which assets are transferred upon plan termination, under IRC tax qualification requirements and under ERISA transaction rules applicable irrespective of tax qualification status. Allows such transfer of assets only if: (1) the transfer is approved in advance in writing by a majority of the participants in the terminated plan; (2) the assets allocated to each participant are immediately deposited to an account under the ESOP for such participant; and (3) the voting ratio under the ESOP of each participant is not less than the participant's asset ratio under the plan. Makes the amendments made by this Act applicable (except as otherwise provided in this Act) to pension plan terminations with respect to which notices are filed with the Corporation, pursuant to specified ERISA provisions, on or after January 1, 1984. Treats any such notice filed before the date of the enactment of this Act as filed on such date for purposes of specified amendments made by this Act."
