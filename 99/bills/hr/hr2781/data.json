    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-06-18", 
    "text": "Act to Combat International Terrorism - Defines \"international terrorism\" for purposes of this Act. Defines \"state support of international terrorism\" as any act of terrorism when committed deliberately by a State by: (1) furnishing arms, explosives, or lethal substances; (2) planning, directing, or training for such an act; (3) providing financial support; (4) providing diplomatic facilities to aid in the commission of such an act; or (5) allowing the use of its territory as a sanctuary from extradition or prosecution. Directs the President to report to the Congress every six months on incidents he determines to be acts of international terrorism. Requires the President to report within 30 days of an occurrence of terrorism if it involves citizens, property, or significant interests of the United States. Requires the report to include: (1) a description of the incident and identity of the individual, group or organization involved in the incident; (2) the identity of any government providing support; (3) a description of the actions of any government assisting in bringing about a positive termination of the incident; and (4) a description of U.S. response to the incident. Directs the President, every six months, to submit a list of states supporting international terrorism to the Congress with reasons for such determinations. Provides that with respect to any listed state the President: (1) shall not provide assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; (2) shall not sell any defense articles under the Arms Control Act; and (3) shall follow a certain procedure with regard to applications for licenses under the Arms Export Control Act. Authorizes the President to devise initiatives to combat international terrorist actions and reduce state support for such actions, including: (1) the suspension of air service between the United States and any state supporting international terrorist actions; and (2) appropriate diplomatic measures. Requires the President to promptly and fully inform the Congress on such actions. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Secretary of Transportation to conduct an assessment and report to the Congress on the effectiveness of security measures at foreign airports. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate authorities of a foreign government if the Secretary finds that one of its airports does not maintain and administer effective security measures. Sets forth notification procedures and, in certain circumstances, procedures to suspend service with regard to an airport which fails to bring security measures up to the specified standards. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and training to foreign governments in aviation security. Amends the Federal criminal code to define \"identification taggant\" and \"detection taggant.\" Makes it unlawful for any person to manufacture any explosive material which does not contain an identification taggant and a detection taggant. Prohibits the resale or disposal of any explosive material sold as surplus by a military, naval, or other agency of the United States which does not contain such identification or detection taggants. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury, under certain conditions, to delay the requirements with regard to detection and identification taggants. Exempts explosive material used by the Department of Defense or for national security from such identification requirements. Amends the Federal criminal code with regard to the destruction of aircraft facilities. Prohibits any act of violence against an individual on board a foreign aircraft while such aircraft is in flight. Makes it an offense to cause damage to (or place explosive devices or substances on) a foreign aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or is likely to endanger that aircraft's safety in flight. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to extend the \"special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States\" to any violator of the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation as long as the aircraft involved lands in the United States with an alleged offender still on board. Makes it a Federal criminal offense to convey any threats with the apparent determination and will to carry out such a threat with regard to the destruction of aircraft, trains, or vessels. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to provide civil and criminal penalties for conveying false information with regard to aircraft piracy. Imposes a civil penalty upon any unauthorized person having possession of a concealed weapon while aboard or boarding any aircraft. Urges the President to seek international agreements to assure more effective cooperation in combating terrorism."
