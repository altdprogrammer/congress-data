States that the Congress shall review each statute to determine that it is not discriminatory or violative of the commerce clause (of the Constitution) and that the statute is consistent with the procompetitive requirements of the Federal antitrust laws. Declares that legislation which authorizes acquisitions or mergers on a reciprocal basis without the imposition of restriction or conditions against out-of-State bank holding companies by reference to their State of origin or size shall not be deemed an interstate compact for purposes of this Act."
