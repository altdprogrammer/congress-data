Permits a creditors' committee to consult with, and make recommendations to, the U.S. trustee concerning the performance of the trustee's duties. Authorizes a court to dismiss: (1) a voluntary liquidation case if the debtor fails to file information on his or her financial affairs within 15 days after filing the petition commencing the case; and (2) a liquidation case if the debtor fails to file his or her intentions for property securing consumer debts within the prescribed period.
