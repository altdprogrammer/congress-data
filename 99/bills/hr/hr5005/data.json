Declares that such a rule, other than an emergency rule, shall not become effective, if within 60 legislative days of promulgation, the Congress adopts a joint resolution of disapproval because the rule contains provisions which are contrary to law, inconsistent with congressional intent, or go beyond the mandate of the legislation the rule is designed to implement. Establishes congressional procedures for consideration of such resolutions. Establishes a 60-day period for public comment at the time of promulgation of a rule, including an emergency rule, and allows agencies to extend such time period by 30 days to enable diligent, interested persons to participate."
