Prohibits U.S. aid to a country if the total amount of illegal narcotics smuggled into the United States from such country does not decrease by ten percent annually. Authorizes restoring aid to such country if the Secretary of State certifies that such nation is the source, in the year before certification, of no greater percentage of smuggled narcotics than any nation which has not been affected by this Act."
