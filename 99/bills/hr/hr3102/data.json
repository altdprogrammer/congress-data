Directs the Secretary of Education, subject to the availability of appropriations under this Act, to establish a program of grants to local educational agencies (LEAs), State educational agencies (SEAs), consortia of public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions, and institutions of higher education for not more than ten demonstration programs in technology education for secondary schools. Sets forth grant application requirements. Directs the Secretary to consider equitable geographic distribution in making such grants. Permits such grants to be used to develop a model demonstration program for technology education with specified components. Includes among such components research and development of curriculum materials, an institute to develop teacher capabilities in technology education, and multidisciplinary teacher workshops for interfacing mathematics, science, and technology education. Limits the Federal share to 65 percent of the costs of programs or projects assisted under this Act. Requires that at least ten percent of such costs be covered by private sector contributions. Directs the Secretary to disseminate the results of such programs or projects so as to improve the training of educational personnel. Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to direct the Secretary to make available specified amounts of discretionary funds to carry out this Act for FY 1987 through 1989."
