    "text": "Video Surveillance Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit any person acting under the authority of the United States from engaging in video surveillance except as authorized by the criminal code with regard to interceptions of oral communications, or by the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Provides that an order authorizing or approving such surveillance: (1) shall be for a period not greater than 30 days, and each extension of such order shall be for a period not greater than 30 days; and (2) may not be issued unless such surveillance may provide or has provided evidence of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a period greater than ten years, or where an emergency situation exists. Authorizes interceptions for the investigation of offenses involving: (1) escape; (2) trafficking in certain motor vehicles or motor vehicle parts; (3) hostage taking; (4) fraud and related activity in connection with access devices; (5) the destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities; (6) the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder for hire; and (7) violent crimes in aid of racketeering activities. Requires that applications for authorizations for interceptions include a statement of the investigative objectives, the specific targets of the interceptions, and the reasons why other investigative procedures are not adequate. Permits an ex parte court order to authorize interceptions outside the court's jurisdiction by a mobile interception device, if such device is installed within the court's jurisdiction. Allows an order to authorize physical entry to install an electronic, mechanical, or other device in situations where there are no other less intrusive means of effecting interception. Requires reports every ten days to the judge who issued the order showing progress made toward achieving the authorized objective."
