    "text": "Common Sense in Government Purchasing Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require executive agencies, when procuring any item, to the maximum extent practicable, to procure nondevelopment items (commercially available items or items developed by Federal, State, or local governments). Directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to designate an official to ensure implementation of such requirement. Requires the Administrator to submit a report to the Congress, within one year of enactment of this Act: (1) identifying all statutes and regulations determined to impede the acquisition of nondevelopment items; and (2) recommending legislation to promote the maximum procurement of nondevelopment items. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct an evaluation of the actions taken by the Administrator under this Act and report to the Congress with the results within two years of enactment."
