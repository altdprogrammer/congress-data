    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #287 (418-0)) Veterans' Health-Care Amendments of 1986 - Amends Federal law to authorize the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to provide respite care to certain veterans. Extends the date by which Veterans Administration (VA) readjustment counseling services programs need to be provided through VA health care facilities. Extends the dates for certain VA reports to the Congress on such programs. Extends the authority to provide and the authorization of appropriations for medical care for U.S. veterans in the Philippines. Authorizes the Administrator to appoint disciplinary boards for medical care personnel, which would propose disciplinary actions involving suspensions exceeding 14 calendar days, demotion involving a loss of grade or pay, or discharges of employees. Extends to four years (currently, two years) the interval between VA reports on pay comparability for VA physicians and dentists. Makes permanent the VA's Regional Medical Education program for the continuing medical education and training of VA personnel. Deletes the current requirements that training be only in-residence and for eligible medical and health personnel. Allows for such training through sharing or cooperative training agreements in the community. Changes the method of calculating the period of obligated service required of part-time participants in the VA's Health Professional Scholarship program by requiring six months of service as a full-time employee for each calendar year or part of a calendar year in which the participant received scholarship support. Requires the Administrator's annual medical facilities construction reports to be based on the facility plans and recommendations of the Chief Medical Director. Extends the authorization of appropriations for grants to States for the construction, renovation or acquisition of State home facilities through FY 1989. Removes the restriction that a State may receive no more than one-third of the amount appropriated in that fiscal year for grants for State home facilities. Gives priority for State home grant applications to States which have appropriated sufficient funds for the State share of the project for which the grant is requested, so that construction, renovation or acquisition may proceed upon approval of the grant without further action by the States.
