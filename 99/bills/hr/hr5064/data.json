Defines \"severely economically disadvantaged\" as individuals who have received benefits under Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) provisions of the Social Security Act for a specified period and who have been unemployed or without city employment for a specified period. Requires the job training program in each service delivery area to establish a feeder system using community based organizations to conduct outreach and provide preemployment services to severely economically disadvantaged individuals. Requires such outreach and feeder system to include: (1) skills assessment; (2) registration with the Bureau of Employment Security; (3) preemployment training, including an eight-week internship with a private or public agency; (4) employment training, including vocational, adult, and community college and other postsecondary programs; and (5) on-the-job and other employment preparation activities available under the Act. Requires preemployment services to include: (1) educational preparation and basic skills development to increase literacy and computational skills; (2) programs to strengthen attitude and motivation for work; (3) guidance and counseling to assist with occupational choices and selection of employment preparation programs; (4) counseling and information and referral for those experiencing personal or family problems; and (5) parenting and home and family living skills, including nutrition and health education, targeted to teenage parents. Requires supportive services, including child care and transportation assistance, to be given to program participants. Provides that program participants will not lose any other Federal benefits because of program participation. Requires State plans to include descriptions of coordination of other programs with such targeted assistance program."
