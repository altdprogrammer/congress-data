    "text": "Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to require the Secretary of Agriculture to determine if the Canadian Government provides a subsidy to Canadian swine producers which is greater than U.S. subsidies to U.S. swine producers. Authorizes the Secretary, upon an affirmative finding, to impose additional duties on Canadian swine and pork products. Provides that the Secretary shall impose such an additional duty equal to the excess benefit of the Canadian subsidy that is conferred on such products. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to collect such duties. Requires the Secretary to terminate such additional duties during periods when Canada ceases to provide such subsidy."
