    "text": "Prohibits the obligation of Federal highway funds for the initial construction of a four-mile route on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways which is located mainly in landfill placed in a river after May 1, 1985, and which is adjacent and parallel to a shoreline. Limits the obligation of Federal funds after enactment of this Act to the initial construction of an alternative interstate route which meets certain construction guidelines. Makes inapplicable to such alternative interstate route the restriction placed upon the obligation of funds to the actual costs of construction features included in the 1981 interstate cost estimate. Prohibits the obligation of Federal funds for any such substitute highway or transit project if such project includes landfill construction (except for a landfill necessary to preserve the existing character and facilities of the waterfront). Prescribes the formula for determining sums made available for the Federal share of public mass transit projects which will serve the area in which such alternative project shall be located. Limits such Federal share to a maximum of 85 percent of the project cost. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1992."
