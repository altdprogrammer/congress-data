    "text": "Navajo-Hopi Land Exchange Act of 1986 - Requires the Navajo Tribe, through its governing body, to adopt a resolution with respect to the transfer of the beneficial interest of the Hopi Tribe in and to the surface estate of specified trust lands and the extinguishment of specified claims of the Hopi Tribe against the Navajo Tribe. Directs the governing body to transmit such resolution to the Secretary of the Interior. Provides that such resolution shall represent the consent of the Navajo Tribe to the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary to review the Navajo resolution to determine if it is in conformance with this Act and if it is a legal action of the Navajo Tribe. Provides that the authorities established by this Act shall lapse if such resolution is not adopted and delivered to the Secretary within a specified time after the enactment of this Act. Requires (upon the publication of the Navajo resolution in the Federal Register) the transfer of all the beneficial interest of the Hopi Tribe in and to the surface estate of specified trust lands in Arizona to the Navajo Tribe, such lands to be held in trust by the United States and made a part of the Navajo Reservation. Requires a similar transfer of specified Navajo lands to the Hopi Tribe. Provides that such lands transferred to the Hopi Tribe shall be in full satisfaction of all interest such Tribe has in the Navajo Indian Reservation. Excludes specified lands from the above-mentioned transfer. Sets forth a formula for the payment of royalties to the Secretary for the benefit of the Hopi Tribe. Entitles the Hopi Tribe to a specified percentage of annual revenues derived by the Navajo Tribe from the development of coal and other mineral resources on specified lands in New Mexico transferred to the Navajo Tribe. Establishes the Navajo Rehabilitation Fund from the remaining revenues for improvement of economic, educational, and social conditions of relocated Navajo families. Extinguishes, upon the publication of the Navajo resolution, specified claims that the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe or that the Navajo Tribe may have against the Hopi Tribe. Repeals specified provisions of the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Amendments Act of 1980. Sets forth a specified time by which members of the Navajo Tribe must relocate from lands partitioned to the Hopi Tribe. Directs the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission to wind up its affairs and cease to exist within a specified time. Establishes the Office of Navajo Relocation within the Office of the Secretary of the Interior to perform the remaining relocation activities of the Commission. Requires the Secretary (when relocations have been completed) to abolish such Office and transfer the remaining responsibilities to the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
