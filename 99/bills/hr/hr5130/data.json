Requires the Secretary, within one year of this Act's enactment, to recommend to the Congress the optimum level and type of Medicare audit expenditures. Directs the Secretary to review the quality control program under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act and, within one year of this Act's enactment, develop procedures and guidelines for such program which require States to implement corrective action plans and management information systems to prevent errors in the provision of services."
