    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-06-12", 
    "text": "Amends Federal military transportation provisions to prohibit the Secretary of Defense from contracting with an air carrier for the charter transportation of members of the armed forces unless the carrier: (1) meets certain financial, performance, and safety requirements to be established by the Secretary; and (2) has at least 12 months' experience that is substantially equivalent to the service sought by the Department of Defense (DOD). Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish the financial, performance, and safety requirements for air carriers to be eligible to contract for such transportation; (2) conduct a technical safety evaluation of each aircraft prior to engaging with DOD for such transportation; (3) provide for periodic inspections of contracted air carriers; (4) establish within DOD a Commercial Airlift Review Board to make certain recommendations to the Secretary concerning such contracted air transportation; and (5) establish guidelines for the suspension and/or reinstatement of air carriers under contract with DOD for such transportation. Authorizes a representative of the Military Airlift Command, the Military Traffic Management Command, or the senior officer on board a chartered aircraft to order members of the armed forces to leave the aircraft if such representative or officer determines that an endangering condition exists on such aircraft. Directs the Secretary to request the Secretary of Transportation to provide a report on each inspection performed by Federal Aviation Administration personnel on each carrier under contract with DOD. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any provision of this Act in an emergency or other appropriate condition. Directs the Secretary, no later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act."
