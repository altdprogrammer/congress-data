    "text": "Biotechnology Science Coordination Act of 1986 - Title I: Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee - Establishes a Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee (the Committee) within the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. Sets forth the functions of the Committee, including: (1) serving as a coordinating forum for addressing scientific problems, sharing information, and developing methods for evaluating risk relating to genetically-engineered organisms; and (2) recommending research priorities to the Board of Governors of the Biotechnology Science Research Program. Title II: Biotechnology Science Research Program - Establishes a Biotechnology Science Research Program (the Program) within the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. Requires the Program to: (1) coordinate the use of resources to create a data base to support the review and regulation of the biotechnology sciences; (2) identify research areas that will facilitate the development and regulation of biotechnology products; and (3) review the research recommendations of the Committee and certain Federal agencies in order to develop a research agenda. Requires the Program to carry out its functions under the supervision of a Board of Governors selected by the Committee. Title III: EPA Regulation of the Release and Use of Genetically-Engineered Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi, Cells, and Tissue - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a permit program regulating the release, distribution, and use of genetically engineered micro-organisms to protect human health and the environment. Provides for initial, expanded, and commercial use permits. Defines \"genetically-engineered organism\" (bacteria, viruses, fungi, cells, and tissues) for purposes of this title. Requires the Administrator to establish a Biotechnology Advisory Panel (the Panel) with expertise in risk assessment and risk management methodologies relating to biotechnology and genetic engineering. Requires the Panel to: (1) review permit applications; (2) prescribe data requirements and risk assessment protocols for permit applicants; and (3) recommend to the Administrator whether permits should be granted and the duration of such permits. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress and to the Committee every six months on the number of applications for such permits and the actions taken with respect to such applications. Title IV: USDA Regulation of the Release and Use of Genetically Engineered Plants, Animals, Biologicals, and Drugs - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to establish a permit program regulating the release, distribution, and use of genetically-engineered organisms to protect human health and the environment. Provides for initial, expanded, and commerical use permits. Defines \"genetically-engineered organism\" (plants, animals, forest resources, veterinary biologicals, and drugs) for purposes of this title. Directs the Secretary to establish an Agriculture Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with expertise in risk assessment and risk management methodologies relating to biotechnology and genetic engineering. Requires the Advisory Committee to: (1) review permit applications; (2) prescribe data requirements and risk assessment protocols for permit applicants; and (3) recommend to the Administrator whether permits should be granted and the duration of such permits. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress and to the Committee every six months on the number of applications and the actions taken with respect to such applications. Title V: Conforming Amendments - Makes conforming amendments to various Federal statutes."
