    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to authorize furnishing specified Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) commodities to countries that have made commitments to introduce or expand free-enterprise elements in their agricultural economies. Limits the amount of commodities available for such purposes in each of FY 1986 through 1989 to 500,000 metric tons. Authorizes the CCC to purchase commodities for such purpose if necessary. Limits the amount the CCC may spend for such purpose unless authorized in advance in appropriation Acts. Authorizes the President to enter into agreements with developing countries to furnish commodities to such countries to promote the implementation of private, free-enterprise agricultural policies for long-term farm development. Directs the President to consider, in entering into such agreements, whether the potential recipient country: (1) is carrying out or is committed to carry out policies that promote economic freedom, private production of food for domestic consumption, and the creation and expansion of efficient domestic markets for commodities; and (2) can use the commodities without disruption of the country's internal market for domestically produced farm commodities and products. Requires each agreement to prohibit the resale or transshipment of the donated commodities to other countries. Requires the President to take precautions to avoid displacement of sales of U.S. farm commodities that would otherwise be made to such countries. Sets forth provisions dealing with the costs and charges of this Act and the administration of this Act. Requires the President to report to the Congress within 120 days after the end of the FY in which such an agreement is in effect."
