    "text": "War on Drug Smuggling Act of 1986 - Directs the Secretary of Defense, upon request from the head of any specified special law enforcement agency, to make available to that agency such military equipment and personnel as necessary for the detection of the unlawful transport of any controlled substance across the international boundaries of the United States and the interdiction in the United States of such unlawful transport. Specifies the authority limits of any military personnel so assigned. Requires the heads of the special law enforcement agencies involved, within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to meet with the Secretary of Defense and the National Guard Bureau to develop plans for the coordination of such controlled substance detection and interdiction activities. Directs the Secretary to invite the chief law enforcement official of each State to such meeting. Defines \"special law enforcement agency\" and \"controlled substance\" for purposes of this Act. Amends Federal criminal law concerning obstruction of justice to make unlawful the patrolling of a place with a firearm with the intent or purpose of enforcing U.S. immigration or customs laws without the permission of an officer of the United States. Requires the Attorney General to issue guidelines specifying the circumstances under which such permission might be granted. Outlines penalties for persons violating such provision."
