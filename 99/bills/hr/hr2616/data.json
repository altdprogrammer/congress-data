    "text": "Dairy Farm Efficiency Promotion Act of 1985 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, to replace existing milk price support provisions with a support price of $11.60 per hundredweight for the first year following enactment of this Act and for the six succeeding years, with four percent annual price decreases. Amends Federal law to authorize the Attorney General to prosecute agricultural cooperative antitrust violations. Amends Agricultural Act of 1933 to terminate milk marketing order authority as of June 1, 1993. Gives consumers and producers standing to petition for marketing order modifications. Sets the highest price for any milk classification at $16 per hundredweight. Amends the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961, as amended by the Rural Development Act of 1972, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide loans to assist certain dairy farmers to convert to non-dairy farming or business operations. Cancels up to five percent annually of such loan for up to ten years for each year of conversion."
