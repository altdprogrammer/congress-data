Directs the Commission to report its findings and recommendations to the Congress by September 30, 1987. Terminates the Commission by December 31, 1987. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Congressional Review and Action on Commission Report - Provides for congressional committee referral and hearings on the Commission's report.
