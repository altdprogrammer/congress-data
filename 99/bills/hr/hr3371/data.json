Directs the Secretary of Education to report to the Congress, within one year after the enactment of this Act, on the effectiveness in reducing student loan defaults of such regulations requiring suspension (for a default rate above 25 percent) or reduction (for a default rate between ten and 25 percent) of Federal capital contributions to a school's student loan fund under the direct student loan program, including recommendations for further reduction of such defaults by extending such regulations beyond FY 1987 and/or other measures. Requires each guaranty agency having an agreement with the Secretary to provide information necessary to carry out the requirement of suspension of the eligible lender status under the guaranteed student loan program of any lender whose default rate exceeds 25 percent. Grants the Secretary specified authority for investigations or hearings to carry out such requirement. Authorizes the Secretary to lift such a suspension of eligibility upon determination that the lender has corrected the practices which led to the suspension."
