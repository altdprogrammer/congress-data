    "text": "Declares specified Indian lands in Utah to be held in trust by the United States for the use and benefit of the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation. Provides the effective date for determining water rights, and priorities related to such rights, in such lands. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to deprive a person of any valid legal existing right or interest in such lands which such person may hold upon enactment of this Act. Transfers all valid Federal rights of way, leases, the right to receive compensation for the use of such lands, and other land use rights or authorizations, except mining claims, to the Tribe. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, not later than two years after enactment of this Act, to determine the validity of all mining claims that exist on such lands upon enactment of this Act. Prohibits the holders of certain claims (hard rock lode) to a patent unless otherwise provided by law. Sets forth certain rights and conditions with respect to valid mining claims. Declares that all right, title, and interest of the United States, and the State of Utah, in certain additional lands is to be held in trust by the United States for the use and benefit of the Tribe and to become a part of the Reservation. Requires the Secretary to publish a legal description of such lands in the Federal Register. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire by donation, exchange, or purchase lands or interests in lands adjacent or close to the Reservation for the use and benefit of the Tribe. Sets forth specified conditions on the exchange of such lands. Requires the Secretary to obtain the advice and consent of the Goshute Tribal Business Council before entering into any transaction for such lands. Requires title to such lands to be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the use and benefit of the Tribe and to become a part of the Reservation. Requires the approval of the Secretary before any transfer of certain Federal lands adjacent to the Reservation. Extinguishes the right of the United States to construct ditches and canals on specified Indian lands. Subjects certain Indian lands to Federal law to the same extent as it already applies on the Reservation."
