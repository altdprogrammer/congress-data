    "text": "Acid Rain Control Act of 1985 - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to compute a State share for each of the 48 contiguous States of a 10,000,000 ton two-tiered reduction in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide below that of 1980 by 1996. Sets forth a formula for determining State shares. Sets deadlines and procedures for submission and approval of State plans for such State shares. Directs the Administrator to promulgate a State plan in the absence of a State-submitted, Administrator-approved plan. Requires such plans to achieve reductions through the use of continuous emission reduction. Prohibits the construction of any new stationary sources of sulfur dioxide in a State which fails to achieve its 1990 or 1996 emissions goals. Prohibits a stationary source from emitting more sulfur dioxide under such plan than it did under the applicable 1982 implementation plan. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations to facilitate State trading of reduction requirements and the substitution of reductions in oxides of nitrogren for reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide permitted under State plans. Establishes civil and criminal penalties and empowers the Administrator to bring civil actions against an electric utility in violation of the fee requirement. Terminates the fee after six years. Imposes a fee on each kilowatt hour of electric energy generated by an electric utility in the contiguous States. Exempts electricity generated by nuclear or hydroelectric power. Establishes in the Treasury the Acid Deposition Control Fund to provide funding for emissions reductions from specified appropriations. Sets forth conditions and administrative provisions for such Fund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on the current and five-year projected financial condition of the Fund. Directs the Administrator to revise nitrogen oxide emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating units. Directs the Administrator to promulgate emissions standards for new, large fossil-fuel-fired steam generating units. Establishes oxides of nitrogen emission standards for light duty trucks after model year 1985. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on the equity of the pass-through of emission control costs through utility rates. Directs the Administrator to conduct an acid deposition research and clean coal technologies demonstration program. Directs the Administrator to financially assist State programs for mitigating the adverse effects of acid rain."
