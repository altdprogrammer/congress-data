    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #308 (219-178)) Assistance for Democracy Act of 1986 - Title I: Promoting Democracy in the Philippines - Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1986 for economic and military assistance for the Philippines. Earmarks a specified amount of such economic assistance for Peace Corps programs in the Philippines. Permits payment of the economic assistance funds to the Philippines only if such funds are kept in a separate account. Prohibits using previously appropriated funds to provide such economic assistance. Amends the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 to repeal certain limits on aid to the Philippines. Urges the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to use development assistance funds to support private and voluntary organizations through which Filipino-Americans serve in the Philippines on a volunteer basis using their expertise to assist economic and social development efforts in areas of the greatest need. Earmarks for the Philippines certain FY 1987 funds for: (1) military assistance; (2) the Economic Support Fund; and (3) foreign military sales financing. Title II: Promoting Democracy in Haiti - Earmarks for Haiti specified amounts of FY 1987 funds from the: (1) Economic Support Fund; (2) development assistance funds; (3) Food for Peace programs; and (4) Inter-American Foundation. Provides that assistance from the Economic Support Fund and the development assistance programs may be obligated for assistance for Haiti only if the President determines that the Government of Haiti is meeting specified conditions, including improving its human rights record and continuing to cooperate in halting illegal emigration to the United States. Permits payment of the Economic Support Fund assistance to Haiti only if such funds are kept in a separate account. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 to increase the FY 1987 authorization for the Inter-American Foundation. Requires a Foreign Commercial Service officer to be assigned to the U.S. embassy in Haiti in order to assist in the economic development in Haiti. Earmarks for Haiti specified amounts of the FY 1987 authorization for military assistance and for international military education and training. Permits such assistance to be obligated only if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) Haiti has submitted a formal request to the United States specifying a comprehensive plan for reorganization of Haiti's military; and (2) Haiti is making substantial efforts to prevent the involvement of the Haitian armed forces in human rights abuses, to protect freedom of speech and assembly, to investigate the killings of certain unarmed civilians, to educate the armed forces about respect for the rights essential to democracy, and to require the former members of the Volunteers for National Security to turn in their weapons. Requires the President to report to the Congress every three months on the extent to which Haiti's actions are consistent with such objectives. Permits the military assistance and the international military and education funds to be obligated for Haiti only if specified congressional committees are notified 15 days in advance. Directs the President to use the President's authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to assist Haiti in its efforts to recover Haitian assets which Haiti alleges were stolen by Jean Claude Duvalier or his associates. Title III: Authorization Levels for Certain Foreign Assistance Programs - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the FY 1987 authorization for: (1) international narcotics control; and (2) the Child Survival Fund. Earmarks a specified amount of the FY 1987 operating expenses of the Agency for International Development for the necessary operating expenses of the Office of the Inspector General of that Agency. Makes offsetting reductions in the FY 1987 authorizations for development assistance health programs and for international organizations and programs in order to provide for the increased FY 1987 authorizations for the Inter-American Foundation, international narcotics control, and the Child Survival Fund."
