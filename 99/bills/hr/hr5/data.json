    "text": "Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and Development Block Grant Act - Establishes within the Treasury an Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and Development Fund. Limits the total amount payable into the Fund during any fiscal year. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to use specified portions of such funds to provide national ocean and coastal resources management and development block grants to each coastal State. Requires such States to report grant allocation and project information and provide opportunity for public comment before receiving such grants. Sets forth a grant allocation formula based on: (1) actual and future outer continental shelf lease sales, including oil and gas; (2) coastal related energy activities; (3) shoreline mileage; and (4) coastal population. Establishes a minimum grant of one-half of one percent of authorized funds for States having approved coastal management programs. Specifies activities authorized by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (and coastal energy impact program) and natural resource management projects which are eligible uses of block grants. Requires States receiving such grants to: (1) undertake certain coordination activities with their respective local governments leading to a proper allocation to local governments of block grant funds; and (2) submit an expenditure assessment to the Secretary."
