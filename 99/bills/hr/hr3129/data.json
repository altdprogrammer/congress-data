States that the moving and related expenses of a nonprofit organization or small business displaced because of Federal acquisition of real property shall be paid to the extent of actual reasonable expenses necessary to reestablish such entity at its new site (but not to exceed $10,000). Revises the limitations placed upon the payments which a displaced business or farm operation may elect to receive (from a minimum of $1,000 to a maximum of $20,000). States that whenever a federally assisted project undertaken by a displacing agency other than a Federal agency will result in the displacement of a utility from property under the ownership or control of a State or local agency, the displacing agency shall provide a payment to the utility under State law (or according to contract provisions), but such payment shall not exceed the actual reasonable cost of relocation. Increases the maximum amount of assistance that a displacing agency may provide to a displaced homeowner for replacement housing. Requires such assistance to include an amount necessary to: (1) meet the reasonable cost of a suitable replacement dwelling as defined in this Act; and (2) compensate the displaced person for any increased financing costs. Authorizes a displacing agency to extend the one-year period, following payment for an acquired home, during which the displaced person must purchase and occupy a replacement dwelling in order to qualify for housing replacement payments, but limits such payments to the costs of relocating such person within that one-year period. Increases from $4,000 to $4,500 the ceiling on the amount of rental housing replacement assistance provided to displaced tenants. Revises the formula used to pay for replacement housing for tenants and certain others by using the median income of the affected area to calculate such payments. Provides that certain displaced homeowners may elect to receive Federal, State or local low income housing assistance in lieu of payments for replacement housing. Specifies conditions under which the displacing agency may meet its requirement to provide suitable replacement housing by providing low income housing assistance if the recipients are persons eligible for such low income housing assistance. Permits eligible displaced tenants to apply such rental assistance toward the downpayment on a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling. Requires that all relocation assistance advisory programs: (1) provide information on suitable locations for displaced farming (and business) operations; and (2) assure that no person is required to move before being given a reasonable choice of comparable replacement dwellings. Provides for the designation of a single, cognizant Federal agency to establish procedures to be used by a non-Federal displacing agency to implement related activities funded by two or more Federal agencies. Directs the lead agency to require that a displacing agency use project funds to provide dwellings for displaced persons in excess of housing replacement assistance ceilings only on a case-by-case basis and for good cause (if the project would be delayed because suitable housing is not otherwise available). Permits a Federal agency to discharge its responsibilities by accepting the certification by a State agency that it will implement State law to carry out the Federal relocation assistance program, provided that the lead agency determines that such State law will accomplish the purpose and effect of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Requires the head of such agency, prior to accepting certification, to provide interested parties with an opportunity for public review and comment, and to consult with interested local governments. Directs the head of the lead agency to monitor and report biennially to the Congress on State agency implementation of such certification. Permits an agency to withdraw acceptance of a certification after providing the State government with notice. Permits a Federal agency to withhold approval of any grant, contract, or cooperative agreement with any displacing agency found to have failed to comply with certification of State law. Provides that any payment a displaced person receives under State law shall replace a housing replacement or real property acquisition payment for substantially the same purpose under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Requires the head of the lead agency to: (1) promulgate rules to carry out such Act; (2) coordinate relocation assistance activities with Federal and federally-financed low-income housing programs; (3) monitor the implementation of such Act; and (4) perform such other duties as necessary. Declares low-income housing assistance as income for purposes of determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal law. Requires a State agency to pay the United States all net amounts (currently all amounts) received from the sale of surplus Federal property transferred to the agency for the purpose of providing replacement housing. Repeals the authority of any displacing agency to make loans to various organizations for planning and obtaining federally-insured mortgage financing for housing for displaced persons. Authorizes the lead agency to prescribe a procedure under which Federal agencies may acquire real property without having it appraised. Permits a displaced person to donate to the acquiring agency the real property being acquired or any of the compensation paid for such property. Sets forth effective dates of specified provisions of this Act."
