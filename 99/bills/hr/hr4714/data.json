Requires that any rounding off shall be in a direction to understate the condition or quality of the grain. Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service to refuse to certify an export crop of grain if he believes that such cargo will deteriorate significantly in quality enroute to a foreign destination. Requires a quality variation statement on all official grade certificates issued for export grain lots. Prohibits the recombination of dockage and foreign material with any grain intended for export when the result will be to reduce quality or spoilage resistance. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1956 to provide in-kind bonuses to producers and exporters of specified high-quality export corn. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make in-kind reimbursements for: (1) inventory loss of value; and (2) cleaning and blending equipment."
