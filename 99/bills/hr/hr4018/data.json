Makes such requirement inapplicable if: (1) such individual has no parent or legal guardian who is living and whose whereabouts are known; (2) the health and safety of the child or individual would be jeopardized if such individual lived with the parent or legal guardian; or (3) such individual has not lived at home for at least one year prior to the child's birth or making a claim for AFDC payments."
