    "text": "Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to deem misbranded any imported meat that is not labeled imported. Requires restaurants and other eating establishments that sell a significant amount of imported meat food products to inform their customers of such fact. Sets forth penalties for noncompliance. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue within 30 days a proposed rule defining what constitutes a significant amount of imported meat. Provides for veto of any proposed rule by either congressional agricultural committee within 60 days after issuance. Requires the Secretary to issue a revised rule within 30 days after such a disapproval. Applies U.S. inspection, sanitary species verification, residue, and agricultural chemical and animal drug use standards to all imported carcasses capable of being used as human food and all meat and meat products offered for importation into the United States. Authorizes the President to exempt certain imports from the chemical and drug standards if not to do so would cause serious damage to U.S. agricultural exports. Requires the President to give the Congress ten days notice before any such exemption becomes effective."
