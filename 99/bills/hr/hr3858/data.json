Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make additional grants to States under specified provisions of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act for identification, treatment, and prevention of sexual abuse. Makes a State eligible for such assistance if the Secretary determines that the State, within one year after the enactment of this Act, has enacted specified legal and administrative changes with respect to the investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases. Requires a State, to be eligible for such assistance, to have in effect a child sexual abuse program which includes at least one statute or administrative procedure to carry out the following categories of reforms: (1) handling such cases so as to reduce the trauma to the child victim; (2) improving the chances of successful prosecution or legal action against child molesters; and (3) improving procedures to protect children from sexual abuse. Directs the Secretary to issue necessary regulations for such assistance program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and 1987."
