Expresses congressional intent: (1) not to exclude Federal jurisdiction on the ground that conduct involving force, violence, or fear thereof takes place in the course of a legitimate business or labor dispute or on the ground that the conduct violates State or local law; and (2) not to chill legitimate labor activity by authorizing Federal prosecution for offenses occurring during a labor dispute not involving extortion. Makes it an affirmative defense to prosecution that the defendant's conduct: (1) was incidental to peaceful picketing in the course of a legitimate labor dispute; (2) consisted solely of minor bodily injury or property damage; or (3) was not intended to extort property."
