    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and Financial Regulations Act - Title I: Emergency Acquisitions - Financial Institutions Emergency Acquisitions Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 to extend until June 30, 1987, the Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to revise provisions governing interstate acquisitions of troubled banks involving Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) financial assistance. Reduces from $500,000,000 to $250,000,000 the minimum total asset requirement of a closed bank or a bank in danger of closing (as certified by the appropriate Federal or State chartering authority) which may be acquired by an out-of-State bank holding company. Authorizes an out-of-State bank or holding company to: (1) acquire a holding company that controls insured bank subsidiaries which hold assets equal to at least $250,000,000, represent a third or more of the total assets of all bank subsidiaries of such holding company, and are in danger of closing; (2) acquire such subsidiaries and affiliated banks; or (3) establish newly chartered banks in the State where such subsidiaries are chartered to merge with or purchase the assets and assume the liabilities of such subsidiaries and affiliated banks. Permits the FDIC to assist a merger or acquisition of an insured bank only at the request of the bank's directors or trustees. Provides that a bank which receives FDIC troubled bank assistance when it is eligible to be acquired by an out-of-State bank or holding company shall remain eligible for such acquisition so long as such assistance remains outstanding. Permits an out-of-State bank to make such an extraordinary acquisition under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act only if such ownership is otherwise specifically authorized. Provides that an out-of-State bank holding company which makes such an acquisition shall, two years after such acquisition, have the same rights to make additional acquisitions and to establish branches as an in-State bank holding company. Prohibits any holding company which makes such an acquisition from being required under State law to divest any other bank or from being prevented from acquiring any other bank or holding company by reason of such acquisition.
