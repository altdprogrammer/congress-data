Entitles certain surviving dependent children of such a person to an annuity equal to the difference between the amount of dependency and indemnity compensation and 55 percent of the retired pay to which the children would have been entitled. Increases the amount of retired pay which shall be reduced by a specified percentage for a person with a spouse or spouse and dependent child who has not elected to provide an annuity for such persons, or has changed such an election. Directs the Secretary concerned to pay an annuity to survivors of a member or former member who died during a specified period and who would have been eligible for retired pay if he had been 60. Requires a person entitled to two annuities because of subsequent marriage to elect which annuity to receive."
