    "text": "Education Technology Act - Title I: Evaluations, Dissemination, and Instructional Models - Directs the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to jointly: (1) evaluate available computer hardware and software in terms of its usefulness in the classroom; and (2) disseminate the results of such evaluation to State and local educational agencies (SEAs and LEAs). Requires, where appropriate, such evaluation to include assessment of the usefulness of computer hardware and software to serve the special needs of certain special populations described under title II of this Act and of the extent to which the software promotes computer use by students of both sexes. Directs NIE and NSF to carry out such evaluation and dissemination functions under grants to or contracts with non-Federal agencies and private nonprofit institutions or organizations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1995 to NSF and NIE for such purpose. Directs NSF to conduct, assist, and foster research and experimentation on, and dissemination of, models of instruction in the operation and use of computers, educational computer software, and curriculum materials. Requires that this be done through grants to or contracts with professional educational, scientific, or engineering organizations, science museums, regional science education centers, public television, SEAs and LEAs, and institutions of higher education, including community colleges. Directs the NSF, in selecting such entities for such grants or contracts, to give priority to those proposals involving specified types of programs (including, among others, programs involving computer libraries, networks, personal microcomputers, or video disc systems). Permits funds available under such grants or contracts to be used to acquire computer hardware and software and manuals for its use. Requires the NSF Director to: (1) report to the Congress annually on the results of such research and experimentation; and (2) in conjunction with NIE, take steps necessary to disseminate information concerning such results to SEAs and LEAs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1995 for such purposes. Subjects the authority to enter into contracts for such purposes to the availability of appropriations therefor. Title II: Teacher Training Institutes - Directs the NSF, with the cooperation of Federal and other appropriate agencies, to arrange for the development and operation of short-term or regular session institutes for advanced study to improve the qualifications of individuals who teach the operation and use of new and evolving technologies (or individuals who are preparing to do such teaching, or who supervise or train such teachers). Requires that this be done through grants to or contracts with the types of entities described under the provisions for research and experimentation in computer instructional models under title I of this Act. Sets forth provisions relating to special populations (as referred to under title I of this Act). Directs NSF, in making such teacher training grants or contracts, to give special consideration to institutes training teachers (or their supervisors or trainers) who are serving or preparing to serve in elementary and secondary schools enrolling substantial numbers of culturally, economically, socially, and educationally handicapped youth or in programs for children of limited English language proficiency. Requires training program applications to indicate that a portion of the funds will be used to instruct enrollees in methods to ensure equal access to and the use of the computer by students from underserved groups, including female students. Makes individuals who attend such teacher training institutes eligible to receive stipends. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1995 to carry out this title. Title III: Acquisition of Computer Hardware - Directs the Secretary of Education to allocate assistance from funds under this title to LEAs for the acquisition of computer hardware for use in school classrooms. Directs the Secretary to allocate to SEAs, from five percent of the funds under this title, assistance for monitoring and enforcement. Bases the allocation to LEAs on the number of children aged five to 17 in their school districts, but reduces such allocations to the extent that such assistance has been or would be in excess of the amount necessary to acquire one unit of computer hardware for each 30 children in average daily attendance at an LEA's schools. Sets forth required contents of LEA applications for such assistance. Sets forth requirements relating to SEA approval of such applications. Sets forth State responsibilities, including State applications relating to such assistance, SEA hearings before final disapproval of any LEA application, general administrative responsibilities, and SEA reports to the Secretary. Sets forth requirements relating to the participation of children from private schools. Requires LEAs to provide for such participation, but allows the Secretary to waive such requirement and arrange for provision of such assistance directly, under specified conditions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 to carry out this title."
