Establishes a Klamath River Basin Fisheries Task Force. Requires the Secretary to establish such restoration program in cooperation with the Task Force. Sets forth the functions and responsibilities of the Task Force. Sets forth standards for any fishery harvest regulations established for the Klamath River Basin Conservation Area.

Specifies that the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall retain the authority to establish penalties for violations of Indian fishery harvest regulations."
