Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide technical assistance to the States. Prohibits the use of funds for: (1) inpatient services; (2) cash payments to intended recipients; (3) land purchases and construction; and (4) satisfying any requirement for the expenditure of non-Federal funds.
