    "text": "Nuclear Whistleblowers Protection Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to prohibit the discharge of or any other discrimination against an employee due to such employee's having notified an employer of an alleged violation of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 or of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Increases from 30 days to one year the period within which an employee may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor regarding reprisal actions as a result of having reported such violations. Entitles a complainant to a review in any Federal district court if the Secretary of Labor does not issue a compliance order (or a denial of the complaint) within a specified time. Requires the prominent posting of the employee protection provisions of this Act in places of employment affected by this Act. States that this Act does not preclude other remedies available to a complainant. Authorizes the award of injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and exemplary damages."
