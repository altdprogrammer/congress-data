    "text": "National Capital Planning Act of 1985 - Amends Federal law to require Federal or District of Columbia agencies, prior to preparing demolition plans for any Federal or District owned building designated an historic landmark or listed in the National Register of Historic Places, to consult with the National Capital Planning Commission. Directs the Commission to issue reports to such agencies but allows the agencies to exercise their own authority. Amends the District of Columbia Alley Dwelling Act to eliminate the requirement that the National Capital Housing Authority receive the Commission's approval for all alley dwelling replatting or condemnation plans. Eliminates the requirement that the Mayor report to the Congress on all operations under such Act upon the completion of such operations. Amends the District of Columbia Code to require the Mayor to submit highway plans to the Commission for comment and review. Eliminates the requirement that the Mayor submit the map of such plans to the Commission for final alterations and approval. Eliminates the need for the Mayor to secure the Commission's approval for the conveyance of District owned property. Limits the Commission's function regarding proposed harbor regulations to the opportunity to review and comment on such regulations before their adoption by the D.C. Council. Increases the rate of compensation for citizen members of the Commission."
