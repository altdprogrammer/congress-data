Rept. 99-96) New GI Bill Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 1984, Title VII of the FY 1985 Department of Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 98-525), to change the initial-entry eligibility date for entitlement to basic veterans' educational assistance from July 1, 1985, to the date of enactment of this Act. Entitles to basic educational assistance those individuals who have previously served on active duty, have left the service for a period of 90 days or more, and reenter the service for a specified period of time. Changes the initial-entry eligibility date for entitlement to such educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve from July 1, 1985, to the date of enactment of this Act. Entitles such Reserve members to such assistance if they have previously served on active duty, have left the service for a period of 90 days or more, and reenter the service for a certain period of active-duty and of reserve service. Changes the entry eligibility date required for an individual to receive educational assistance for inservice enrollment in a program of education. Changes the time period during which individuals on active duty in the armed forces are prohibited from initial enrollment into the veterans' educational assistance program to the period between January 1, 1986, and June 30, 1988. Changes from July 1, 1985, to the date of enactment of this Act the eligibility date for educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve who enlist, reenlist, or extend their service in the Reserve for a period of at least six years."
