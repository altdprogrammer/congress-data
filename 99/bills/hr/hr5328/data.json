Sets limits on the interest rates to be charged on such loans. Makes provision for the Government to pay the excess of an interest rate over four percent and to share the payment with the borrower if such interest rate exceeds ten percent. Requires the Administrator of the SBA to reimburse any lender for administrative expenses associated with such disaster loans. Allows the Administrator to sell to the public the assets of any disaster loan made before enactment of this Act. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees."
