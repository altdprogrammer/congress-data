    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1986-05-13", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Education Research and Statistics Amendments of 1986 - Amends the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) to revise provisions relating to education and statistics. (Conforms GEPA provisions to an Executive reorganization whereby functions of the National Institute of Education are transferred to the Office of Education Research and Improvement and functions of the National Center for Educational Statistics are transferred to the Center for Statistics.) Revises the declaration of policies relating to the Federal role in educational research and improvement. Declares that it is the purpose of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) to carry out such educational research and improvement policies. Provides that OERI shall be administered by the Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement. Provides that OERI shall include: (1) the National Advisory Council on Educational Research and Improvement; (2) the Center for Statistics; and (3) such other units as the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) considers appropriate to carry out the purposes of OERI. Sets forth research and development priorities for OERI, including improvement of: (1) student achievement; (2) equal educational opportunity; (3) collection, analysis, and dissemination of educational data; and (4) dissemination and application of knowledge obtained through such research and data collection. Directs the Secretary to biennially publish proposed research priorities and provide for a period of public comment. Sets forth provisions relating to the membership and functions of the National Advisory Council on Educational Research and Improvement. Directs the Council to report annually to the President and the Congress on OERI activities and education, educational research, and data gathering in general. Sets forth various authorities of the Secretary in carrying out OERI activities, including limited hiring authority. Sets forth requirements which the Secretary must meet in making awards to carry out OERI activities. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out OERI functions, to support: (1) regional educational laboratories; (2) research and development centers; (3) meritorious unsolicited proposals for educational research and related authorized activities; and (4) proposals that the Secretary specifically invites or requests which meet priority research and development needs. Sets forth requirements for applications for such assistance. Requires the Secretary to make available adequate funds to support meritorious, unsolicited proposals and provide sufficient notice of the availability of such funds to individual researchers in all regions of the country. Authorizes the Secretary to establish and maintain research fellowships in the OERI. Directs OERI to carry out (through a nonprofit organization) a National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Retains provisions relating to NAEP and its Assessment Policy Committee. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for periodic review of NAEP; (2) report to the Congress and the President on the review's findings and recommendations; and (3) consider such findings and recommendations in designing the competition to select the nonprofit organization through which OERI carries out NAEP. Authorizes appropriations to carry out NAEP for FY 1987 (in an increased amount) and for FY 1988 and 1989 (in necessary amounts). Requires that at least 95 percent of such funds be expended through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts. Authorizes OERI to administer NAEP funds for any other Federal agencies which use funds to support a single NAEP project. Transfers National Institute of Education property and records to OERI. Waives a three-year employment period limitation in the case of three OERI employees who were employed by the National Institute of Education. Sets forth provisions transferring functions of the National Center for Education Statistics within the Office of the Assistant Secretary to the Center for Statistics (the Center) within OERI. Provides that the Center shall be headed by a Director. Adds to the Center's functions the analysis of educational data. Directs the Center to collect, collate, and report educational statistics on a State-by-State basis, if feasible. Revises the ex officio membership of the Advisory Council on Education Statistics. Gives the Secretary (rather than an Assistant Secretary) responsibility for making a report on Center activities. Deletes certain grant making authority relating to Center activities. Requires the Center to provide State and local educational agencies opportunities to suggest the development of particular compilations of statistics, surveys, and analyses that would assist those educational agencies. Authorizes appropriations for the Center for FY 1987 (in an increased amount) and for FY 1988 and 1989 (in necessary amounts). Eliminates a requirement that the Center compile profiles of State equalization of resources among school districts. Prohibits the National Advisory Council on Educational Research and Improvement, the Advisory Council on Education Statistics, and the members from using any staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, or franking privileges of such councils for activities unrelated to council purposes. Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to require the Secretary to fund the National Diffusion Network at a level not less than 34 percent of the funds reserved under discretionary program provisions. Sets forth the objectives of such Network and the Secretary's duties and authority with respect to it."
