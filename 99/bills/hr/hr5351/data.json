    "text": "Agriculture and Timber Products Shipper Protection Act of 1986 - Delineates the essential terms of an agricultural commodities transportation contract which must be made available to the general public in tariff format. Deems any subsequent changes to such terms to be a new contract for purposes of this Act. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission to promulgate within 60 days after enactment of this Act regulations which require such essential contract terms to be made available to the general public in tariff format. Extends from 30 days to 60 days the deadline for filing a complaint against a shipping contract. Directs the railroad contract rate advisory service to: (1) assess the impact on competition among agricultural shippers of contract rate variations for various shipments and published single car rates; and (2) report to the Congress within 120 days after the enactment date of this Act. Prohibits certain rail carriers from requiring of any shipper a minimum number of more than 750 cars annually for timber products' transportation."
