    "text": "Comprehensive Steel Technology Research and Development and Energy Conservation Act of 1986 - Establishes a scientific research and development program to develop advanced steel manufacturing technologies and to increase energy efficiency in the steel industry. Directs the Secretary of Energy to develop and publish a plan to conduct such a research and development program as part of the Department of Energy's energy conservation programs. Sets forth provisions for protection of proprietary rights and for coordination within the Department of Energy. Directs the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), through its Institute for Materials Science and Engineering and in coordination with the Department of Energy, to conduct an expanded program of steel research in support of activities conducted under the plan. Provides for detail of personnel from other Federal agencies for purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of NBS, to report annually through FY 1991 on the plan to the President and the Congress. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991 to the Secretary and to the Director of NBS to carry out this Act. Terminates this Act and all authority under this Act at the close of FY 1991."
