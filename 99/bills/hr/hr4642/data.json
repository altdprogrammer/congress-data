Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nevada shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nevada which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas, subject to mandatory review by the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on such grazing at least every five years. Title II: Great Basin National Park and Preserve - Establishes the Great Basin National Park and Preserve in Nevada. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to the appropriate congressional committees on a management plan for such park. Authorizes appropriations."
