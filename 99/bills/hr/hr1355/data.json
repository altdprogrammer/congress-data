    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit the reduction required in computing the tax deduction for corporate charitable contributions in the case of contributions of property used in postsecondary vocational education programs. Specifies certain requirements which the property donated must meet to qualify for such treatment. Allows an employer a tax credit for a specified dollar amount per course for vocational education courses taught by an employee without compensation and for employment of full-time vocational education instructors. Limits the aggregate amount allowed as a tax credit to any taxpayer for any taxable year to not more than $20,000. Restricts the number of courses which may be taught by one employee to five."
