Requires the Federal Government to pay the interest accruing on such claims for the period during which the payment or notice is past due. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from modifying certain regulations relating to the periodic interim payment method of reimbursing providers. Directs the Secretary to develop an optional interim periodic payment system for participating physicians who have at least one year of claims experience."
