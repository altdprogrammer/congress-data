Makes the representation of material witnesses in custody a right of such witnesses instead of discretionary with the court. Authorizes the representation of financially eligible persons charged with a petty offense for which a sentence of confinement is authorized. Authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to set and modify the maximum hourly rates within a certain range which appointed counsel shall receive. Increases the maximum amounts appointed counsel may receive: (1) in a felony case, from $2,000 to $3,500; (2) for a misdemeanor, from $800 to $1,500; and (3) for an appeal, from $2,000 to $2,500. Provides that for any other kind of representation authorized by this section, the compensation shall not exceed $750. Provides for an additional $300 for investigative, expert, or other services without prior authorization in certain circumstances. Increases the maximum amount of compensation paid to a person for services other than for legal counsel to $1,000. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide liability insurance for employees of a Federal Public Defender Organization or Community Defender Organization receiving grants. Allows a Federal Public Defender, by majority vote of the court of appeals, to continue in office after the expiration of such term of office until a successor is appointed or one year after such term of office expires, whichever is earlier. Authorizes appropriations to the U.S. courts for representation plans, including funds for the continuing education of persons providing representational services. Amends the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 to make technical and conforming amendments. Authorizes Federal defenders and other attorneys appointed under the Criminal Justice Act to certify the payment of defense witnesses in Federal criminal cases."
