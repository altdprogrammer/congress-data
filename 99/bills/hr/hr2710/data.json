Directs the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a body, to provide advice to the President and the Secretary of Defense on matters with respect to which such advice is requested. Requires the Chairman to inform the President of the military advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a body on those matters with respect to which such advice is requested by the President or the Secretary of Defense (including matters on which the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not agreed). Permits the individual members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other than the Chairman, to submit their opinion in disagreement with military advice of the Chairman or the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Secretary of Defense and, after informing the Secretary of Defense, to the President. Provides that the President or Secretary of Defense may direct that the national military chain of command runs to the commanders of the unified and specified combatant commands through the Chairman. Directs the Chairman to supervise the commanders of the combatant commands and to act as their spokesman. Extends the term of command of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to four years (currently two years). Provides that any officer appointed to fill a vacancy as Chairman shall serve only for the remainder of the original term. Establishes the position of Deputy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sets out the duties and functions of such Deputy Chairman. Provides that the Joint Staff shall be under the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and eliminates the provision specifying 400 as the maximum number of officers who may be on the Joint Staff. Directs the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be responsible for the management of the Joint Staff. Permits the extension of the tour of duty of members of the Joint Staff with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. Provides for the operation of the Joint Staff. Requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in making recommendations for an initial appointment to a grade above major general or rear admiral, to submit to the President an evaluation of the performance of that officer as a member of the Joint Staff and in other assignments involving joint military experience. Directs the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Congress a report containing plans for the manner in which further improvements in joint commands may be carried out."
