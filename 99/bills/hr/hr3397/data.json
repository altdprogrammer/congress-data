Expands the definition of permitted income of regulated investment companies to provide that \"securities\" has the same meaning as it does under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Provides that foreign currency gains are included in the definition of qualifying income as well as other income with respect to a regulated investment company's business of investing in stocks, securities, or income from gains from options or futures contracts. Provides that each separate portfolio in a series fund will be treated as a separate corporation for purpose of eligibility for conduit treatment of a regulated investment company. Extends to 60 days the period for mailing various notices to shareholders of regulated investment companies. Expands the definition of \"third-party recordkeepers\" to include regulated investment companies with respect to certain protections in connection with summonses that are served for obtaining records."
