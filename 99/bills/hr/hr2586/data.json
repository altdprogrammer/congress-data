Permits obligating FY 1986 and 1987 funds for Haiti for development assistance, Economic Support Fund projects, and international military education and training programs only if Haiti: (1) is continuing to cooperate with the United States in halting illegal emigration to the United States; (2) is cooperating fully in implementing U.S. development, food, and other economic assistance programs in Haiti; and (3) is making progress toward improving the human rights situation and toward implementing political reforms. Requires the President to report to the Congress every six months through FY 1987 on the extent to which Haiti is meeting such goals. Permits using foreign assistance funds for programs with Haiti to assist in halting significant illegal emigration from Haiti to the United States. Prohibits providing military assistance or foreign military sales financing for Haiti for FY 1986 or 1987 except for necessary articles and services for the continuation of migrant and narcotics interdiction operations. Earmarks specified amounts of the FY 1986 and 1987 Economic Support Fund authorizations for Haiti for literacy programs."
