Prohibits exporting to such a country: (1) goods, technology, or other information that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of that country or that could enhance the ability of such country to support international terrorism; and (2) any aircraft. Prohibits rescinding a determination that a country supports international terrorism, unless the Secretary of State, at least 60 days before the rescission would take effect, certifies to the Congress that: (1) the country has not provided support for international terrorism for the preceding 12 months; and (2) the country has made explicit assurances that it will not support international terrorism in the future. Directs the President to try to secure international cooperation in prohibiting such exports to such countries. Directs the Secretary of State, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to compile a list of countries providing support to international terrorism and a list of the goods, technology, and other information which shall not be exported to such countries."
