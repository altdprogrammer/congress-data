    "text": "Federal Telecommunications Privacy Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit any Federal officer or employee from permitting the recording of, or listening-in on, any conversation on the Federal telecommunications system or any business conversation between a Federal officer or employee and any other person on any other telecommunications system, with the following exceptions. Permits the recording of, or listening-in on, such a conversation: (1) without the consent of any party to the conversation if authorized under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; (2) with the consent of one party for law enforcement, counterintelligence, or public safety purposes, for service monitoring required to effectively perform the agency mission, or by a handicapped employee if necessary to his or her official duties; or (3) with the consent of all the parties to the conversation. Sets forth restrictions and disclosure requirements for certain authorized recording or listening-in activities. Requires that any request to the General Services Administration for acquisition approval or installation of listening-in or recording devices be accompanied by a determination signed by the agency head specifying the need for such devices, the location and number of telephones and recorders involved, the operating times and a specific expiration date, and the justification for the use of such devices. Directs an agency to reevaluate the need for such a determination authorizing listening-in or recording of telephone conversations at least every two years. Includes any recording or transcription of a conversation made under, or in violation of, this Act as a record subject to disclosure restrictions."
