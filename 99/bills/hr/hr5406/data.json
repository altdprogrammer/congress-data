Rept. 99-973 (Part I)) Coast Guard Drug Interdiction and Law Enforcement Act of 1986 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Coast Guard: (1) should be given the resources to increase its ability to interdict the illegal transportation of drugs; and (2) is the best qualified Federal agency to carry out drug interdiction on the high seas and U.S. waters. Amends Federal law to require the Coast Guard to engage in maritime air surveillance or interdiction. Authorizes the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to make inquiries, inspections, searches and seizures, and arrests: (1) on vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction on the high seas and U.S. waters; and (2) on aircraft subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary to order such aircraft to land. Sets forth: (1) the duties and authorities of Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, and petty officers in support of such surveillance and interdiction activities; and (2) certain seizure requirements. Authorizes additional appropriations for the Coast Guard for FY 1987 and 1988 for additional personnel, equipment, and related capital improvements. Authorizes the Coast Guard to: (1) recruit and train 1,500 additional active duty military personnel; (2) obtain certain equipment and aircraft; and (3) coordinate its activities with State, local, and other government authorities."
