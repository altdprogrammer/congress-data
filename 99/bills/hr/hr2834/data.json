    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to permit specified domestic entities, before the 75th day after either the filing of a petition for import relief regarding a perishable commodity or the beginning of an investigation regarding a perishable commodity, to file a request with the International Trade Commission (the Commission) for interim import relief for the domestic industry producing a competitive commodity. Requires the Commission, within 45 days after receiving a request for interim import relief to make its decision and recommend, if relief is to be granted, the form of relief. Directs the Commission to recommend interim import relief if it has reason to believe that: (1) the domestic industry producing the competitive perishable commodity is likely to be irreparably harmed if relief is not granted; and (2) the imports are of such a quantity as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. Directs the Commission, if it recommends import relief, to recommend to the President interim relief in the form of: (1) an increased duty on the perishable commodity; (2) a tariff-rate quota on the commodity; or (3) such other relief as is necessary to prevent irreparable harm. Requires the President, within seven days after receiving a recommendation from the Commission, to decide whether or not to provide relief. Gives the President the option, under certain circumstances, to proclaim import relief in the form of quantitative restrictions. Provides that the interim import relief shall terminate the day on which either: (1) the Commission notifies the Commissioner of Customs that the Commission did not find, pursuant to its investigation, a serious injury or threat to the domestic industry concerned; or (2) the President, after receiving a report from the Commission, determines not to provide import relief. Lists the perishable commodities covered by this Act."
