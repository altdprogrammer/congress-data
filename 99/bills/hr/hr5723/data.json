Limits the contractor for such a project to certain comprehensive medical plans. Specifies the terms and conditions of the project contract, including benefits: (1) without any deductible; and (2) limited to expenses totalling at most $18,000 per calendar year, with the individual being liable for 25 percent of any such expenses. States that the project shall be designed by OPM, participating carriers, and a consultant contracted for by the OPM. Requires periodic written evaluations of the project by the consultant, to be submitted to OPM and certain congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990."
