Sets guidelines for the implementation of such program. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1986 through 1988.

Title IV: Amendment to Internal Revenue Code of 1954 Repealing Certain Imputed Interest Rules Relating to Sales of Farms - Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to imputed interest rules relating to farms to exclude: (1) any farm sales (currently only sales under $1,000,000) by individuals or small businesses from the determination of issue price in the case of certain property debt instruments; and (2) any farmland transfers between related parties from the guidelines for interest on certain deferred payments debt instruments. Title V: Amendment to Internal Revenue Code of 1954 Providing Exemption from Tax on Sales of Farm Property in Bankruptcy, Etc. - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exclude from gross income any gain realized on the sale of farm property in bankruptcy; and (2) make inapplicable to farm property transferred under foreclosure or bankruptcy certain disposition and business credit guidelines.

Title VII: Effect of Exchange Rates on Foreign Agricultural Sales - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress regarding the results of a study determining the effect upon foreign agricultural sales, overseas market development, and agricultural imports of: (1) the exchange rate of the dollar; and (2) the imposition of a currency adjustment charge neutralizing such exchange rate. Title VIII: Stabilizing the Value of Farm Assets - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to prescribe standards for the determination of the value of agricultural land or assets whenever the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) examines the collateral used to secure an agricultural loan made by an FDIC-insured bank."
