    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended (Inserted text of H.R. 3852), roll call #447 (391-33)) Superfund Amendments of 1985 - Title I: Provisions Relating Primarily to Response and Liability - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (Superfund) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish reportable quantities for all hazardous substances by December 31, 1986. Directs the Administrator to give primary attention to releases which may present a threat to public health. Grants the Administrator discretion to decide when responsible parties are authorized to conduct cleanup actions in lieu of Superfund-financed responses. Requires short-term removal actions undertaken by the Administrator to contribute to the degree possible to the efficient performance of any long-term action. Requires coordinated action among Federal and State natural resources trustees when hazardous substance releases threaten such resources. Requires States to assure the availability of hazardous waste disposal facilities sufficient for the next 20 year's wastes. Credits States with expenditures made at National Priorities List (NPL) sites on cost-eligible response actions. Revises other State cost-sharing measures. Treats long-term cleanup of groundwater or surface water as part of the costs of remedial action. Grants EPA employees or contractors the necessary access to facilities and information to determine if the need for a response action exists. Prescribes a cleanup schedule for Superfund, requiring the Administrator to list at least 1,600 facilities on the NPL by January 1, 1988. Sets a schedule for the conduct of remedial investigations and feasibility studies (RIFS) and remedial actions at NPL sites. Requires remedial actions at currently listed NPL sites to be completed within five years or, if not completed, requires a published explanation of such noncompletion. Directs the Administrator to revise the National Contingency Plan (NCP) within 18 months to reflect this Act's amendments. Requires the review of the hazard ranking system within one year. Permits individuals to petition the Administrator for a preliminary hazard assessment at a site. Includes contamination of the ambient air and damage to the human food chain as criteria for ranking a hazard. Requires the Administrator to consider using qualified minority firms for contracts under this Act. Prohibits the Administrator from taking abatement action against any release resulting from an applied pesticide registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Includes all vessels releasing hazardous substances within the jurisdiction of the United States under the liability provisions of CERCLA. Makes certain investigatory and assessment costs recoverable from the responsible party. Exempts from liability for all but negligent actions of government agencies responding to a hazardous substance emergency. Directs the Administrator and each Governor to appoint Federal and State trustees, respectively, for natural resources, creating a rebuttable presumption that their assessment of damages to such resources is valid. States that cleanup costs incurred in a response action constitute a Federal lien against the property of a responsible party, except as specified. Sets forth evidentiary requirements for establishing financial responsibility. Permits direct action against a financial guarantor if the person liable is financially or physically unavailable for redress. Entitles such a guarantor to all rights and defenses available to the liable party. Limits the liability of such guarantor to its financial responsibility to the responsible party. Increases criminal penalties and adds certain civil penalties for violations of this Act, including failure to provide accurate information at specified times. Authorizes a reward for information leading to a criminal conviction under this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $1,830,000,000 for each of FY 1986 through 1990 from Superfund, establishing the Fund level. Authorizes the use of Superfund monies for the authorities created by this Act. Eliminates the use of Superfund for payment of natural resource damage claims, except as specified. Revises auditing procedures to require annual audits and reports to the Congress by the Inspector General. Authorizes appropriations out of general revenues for Superfund for FY 1986 through 1990 of $250,000,000 per year. Establishs a six-year statute of limitations for Superfund claims, setting forth special rules for minors and incompetents. Authorizes nationwide service of process under CERCLA. Establishes a three year statute of limitations for the initiation of actions for contribution for response costs of damages and for recovery claims for for damages to natural resources. Establishs a six-year statute of limitations for cost recovery actions. Prohibits pre-enforcement review of a removal action, except as specified. Limits judicial review of Federal decisions under this Act to the administrative record. Establishes new procedures for reimbursement of costs and provides opportunities for judicial review of administrative orders once the response action is completed. Authorizes a State to require contributions to a fund to pay the costs of hazardous substance response actions or damages. Establishes within the Public Health Service the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), headed by an Administrator. Requires ATSDR to implement the health-related authorities of this Act. Directs such Administrator to establish and maintain a listing of areas closed to the public or otherwise restricted in use because of contamination by hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants. Directs the Administrators of EPA and ATSDR to list and periodically revise a list of hazardous substance (includes pollutants or contaminants to the degree they are determined to be hazardous.) Directs the Administrator of ATSDR to establish and maintain an inventory of information on the health effects of each listed substance. Requires such Administrator to also develop toxicological profiles for each substance, assessing the current state of knowledge of their deleterious effects, and revising such profiles at least every three years. Requires the Administrator to initiate research where inadequate information on a substance is available. Requires Federal coordination of research efforts.
