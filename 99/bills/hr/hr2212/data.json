Authorizes, two years after enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to approve an application permitting a bank holding company of one State to merge with or acquire a bank holding company of a contiguous State or a State within the same Federal Reserve district. Repeals restrictions on interstate banking acquisitions by bank holding companies four years after enactment of this Act."
