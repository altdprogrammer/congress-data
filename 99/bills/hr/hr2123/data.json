Permits the Administrator to contract for care and treatment of, and rehabilitative services for, veterans with alcohol and drug dependencies or abuse disabilities. Extends such treatment program to September 30, 1988. Deletes the requirement that the Administrator report to certain congressional committees concerning the drug and alcohol program. Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year for FY 1987 through 1991, for education and training of health service personnel assigned to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center of the Philippines and for equipment and facilities repair and replacement. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1991 to assist the States in furnishing domiciliary or nursing home care to veterans, and to expand, remodel, or alter existing buildings for furnishing domiciliary, nursing home, or hospital care to veterans in State homes."
