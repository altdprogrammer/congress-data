Restricts income to such endowments to the payment of the costs of facility operations. Prohibits the Archivist from accepting title to any land, facility, or equipment unless specified conditions are met with respect to amounts available in an endowment and other costs. Directs the Archivist to study the demand for, and the costs of, establishing a museum of the Presidents. Requires the study to examine the feasibility of establishing and operating such museum exclusively with non-Federal funds.
