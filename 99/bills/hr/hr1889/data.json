Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to authorize using foreign currency proceeds from certain agricultural sales to immunize children participating in nutrition programs. Requires the President to report to the Congress on such immunizations. Requires an agreement with a nonprofit agency for nonemergency assistance under the famine relief provisions of such Act to contain, if requested by such agency, multiyear commitments to make farm commodities available for that agency, unless the President determines that such agreement should be limited. Amends the Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 to extend the authority to maintain the Food Security Wheat Reserve through September 30, 1989."
