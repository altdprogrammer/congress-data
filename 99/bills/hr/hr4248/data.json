    "text": "Interlocking Directorate Act of 1986 - Amends the Clayton Act to prohibit any person from serving as a director in two or more corporations if each (currently, any) of such corporations has capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating more than $10,000,000 (currently, $1,000,000). Establishes exceptions to such interlocking directorate prohibition where the sales of each corporation of each product or service sold in competition with the other corporations: (1) are less than five percent of such corporation's total sales, unless such corporation's sales of all such products or services exceed 25 percent of its total sales; (2) added to such corporation's sales of all other such products or services are less than $1,000,000; or (3) are less than three percent of the total sales in each line of commerce in each section of the country in which such corporations compete. Increases the $10,000,000 and $1,000,000 threshold amounts by the percentage increase in the gross national product for the preceding fiscal year."
