States that bidding for the sale of Conrail should be reopened and a greater effort made to maximize the return to the United States for the substantial Federal investment made in Conrail. Amends the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 to delay until December 31, 1985, the earliest date for submission of a Conrail sale plan."
