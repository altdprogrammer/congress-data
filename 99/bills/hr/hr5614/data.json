Requires that, under such certificates, individuals be paid wages which are: (1) lower than the applicable minimum wage; (2) commensurate with those paid to similarly located and employed nonhandicapped workers; and (3) related to the individual's productivity. Requires employers to assure that they will periodically review and adjust such wages in a specified manner. Sets forth procedures for administrative review of such wages."
