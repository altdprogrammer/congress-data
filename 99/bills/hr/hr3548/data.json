Grants duty-free treatment to specified amounts of such jewelry (including such jewelry with foreign components, unless column 2 duty rates apply) that is manufactured in any of the U.S. insular possessions. Requires the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to establish a limit on the quantity of such jewelry that may enter the United States duty-free during any calendar year after 1986. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of the total quantity authorized to be entered during each calendar year among the producers in each possession. Requires the Secretaries, in each year beginning after December 31, 1985, and before January 1, 1995, to verify the wages paid by each producer of jewelry to permanent residents of each possession and to issue a certificate to such producer for the applicable amount. Entitles any certificate holder to a refund of duties paid equal to the face value of the certificate on the jewelry."
