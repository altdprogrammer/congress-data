Prohibits the Commission from prescribing any rule, regulation, or policy with respect to distress sales of minority-controlled broadcast stations or with respect to Commission certifications concerning the sale or exchange of property necessary to effectuate Commission policies if such rule, regulation, or policy fails to comply with the policy published by the Commission in its Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcast Facilities on May 25, 1978."
