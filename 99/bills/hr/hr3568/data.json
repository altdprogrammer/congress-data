Requires such regulatory authority to determine: (1) whether repair costs for utility equipment were caused by imprudent utility action or inaction; and (2) if any damages to electric power customers were the result of unreasonable delay in electric service restoration. Prohibits repair costs caused by imprudent utility action or inaction from being charged to such utility customers. Requires the utility to compensate customers damaged by unreasonable delay in electric service restoration."
