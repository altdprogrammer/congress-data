Provides that such programming shall not be taken into account in determining the extent to which any broadcast station is operating in the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Requires a cable system operator to meet such an equal time requirement with respect to alcoholic beverage advertisements on programming subject to such operator's editorial control."
