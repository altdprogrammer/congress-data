    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-06-12", 
    "text": "Employment and Training Program Act - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to make a household ineligible for two months for food stamp program assistance if it includes a physically and mentally fit person between the ages of 18 and 60 who refuses, without good cause, to participate in a State employment and training program, as required under this Act, including any reasonable employment requirements as are prescribed by a State agency in accordance with this Act. (This provision replaces another eligibility disqualification provision based on refusal to fulfill whatever reasonable reporting and inquiry about employment requirements are prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture.) Provides that any period of ineligibility for specified violations under such Act shall end when the household member who committed the violation complies with the requirement violated. Provides that, if the member who committed the violation leaves the household during the period of ineligibility, such household shall no longer be subject to the sanction for the violation and may resume participation in the program if it is otherwise eligible. Provides that any other household of which such violator thereafter becomes the head of the household shall be ineligible for the balance of the period of ineligibility. Requires each State agency responsible for the food stamp program to design and implement an employment and training program to assist members of households receiving food stamp program benefits under such Act in gaining skills, training, or experience that will increase their ability to obtain regular employment. Requires that such employment and training programs contain specified components (including job search programs), chosen by the State agency. Authorizes the State agency to provide that participation in such an employment and training program may supplement or supplant other requirements imposed on those subject to the program. Requires the State agency to exempt categories of household members from participation in any such employment and training program if the State agency determines that the application of such requirements is impracticable. Authorizes the State agency, in making such a determination, to designate a category consisting of all such household members residing in a specified area of the State. Requires the State agency to also exempt or suspend from such requirements individual household members not included in any such category if it determines that application of such requirements to them is impracticable because of personal circumstances. Limits the total hours worked by members of a household in such employment and training program, together with the hours worked in any other program under such Act or for compensation in another capacity. Requires the State agency to establish requirements which it determines appropriate for participation by individuals who are not exempt in one or more employment and training programs. Allows such requirements to vary among participants. Authorizes the State agency to operate employment and training programs for food stamp program recipients in which individuals elect to participate. Requires the State agency to permit individuals who are not subject to the requirements it establishes or who have completed or are in the process of complying with such requirements to participate in any employment and training program for food stamp program recipients. Directs the Secretary to set guidelines to enable the State agency to operate such employment and training programs in a manner compatible and consistent with similar programs operated within the State. Requires the State agency to reimburse participants for transportation costs and other expenses incurred in the employment and training program, but allows the State agency to limit such reimbursement to each participant to $25 per month. Requires the State plan of operation for the food stamp program to include provisions relating to the manner in which the State agency will carry out the employment and training program required under this Act. Directs the Secretary to allocate, from funds appropriated under such act, specified amounts for FY 1986 through 1990 to pay to each State agency the full cost (with specified exceptions) of carrying out the employment and training program required under this Act. Directs the Secretary to pay a State agency 50 percent of any such costs which exceed the amount payable to the State under the preceding sentence. Directs the Secretary, in accordance with provisions relating to administrative cost-sharing, to reimburse each State agency 50 percent of the total amount of payments made or costs incurred in connection with transportation costs and other expenses reasonably incurred by participants in the employment and training program, with such total amount not to exceed more than $25 per participant per month. Directs the Secretary to monitor the employment and training programs carried out by State agencies under this Act to measure their effectiveness in terms of the increase in the numbers of household members who, as a result of program participation, obtain employment and the numbers of those who retain such employment. Directs the Secretary, by January 1, 1989, to report to specified congressional committees on the effectiveness of such employment and training programs."
