Requires the family's AFDC eligibility to be preserved notwithstanding a parent's resulting earnings, so long as earnings do not exceed the State's standard of need, without regard to the 100-hour rule. Requires a State desiring to establish and conduct a project to submit an application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Sets forth requirements a project must meet in order to be approved. Permits approval of a project only if the county or political subdivision within which the project will be conducted has had an unemployment rate of at least ten percent in the immediately preceding four quarters, and: (1) at least 20 percent of the population is below poverty level; (2) at least 20 percent of the population is receiving public assistance; and (3) at least 20 percent of the AFDC families are receiving aid under provisions making such aid available to families with unemployed parents. Requires: (1) States and political subdivisions to report to the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary to report to the Congress."
