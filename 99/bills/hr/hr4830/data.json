    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-05-15", 
    "text": "Trade Expansion and Competitiveness Act of 1986 - Title I: Banking Committee Provisions - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Reagan administration has substantially reduced the value of the dollar and is successfully coordinating its economic policies with our major trading partners; (2) the Reagan administration should continue its progress in promoting long-term exchange rate stability and sustaining noninflationary economic growth; and (3) any congressional action on the exchange rate at this time is unneeded and potentially harmful. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Reagan administration should continue to have the maximum amount of discretion in implementing its cooperative debt strategy; and (2) the objectives of such a strategy should continue to emphasize the need for adjustment policies and sound economic planning in developing countries. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a Competitive Tied Aid Fund in the Treasury. Requires the Fund to be used to supplement the financing of U.S. exports to foreign markets which are actual or potential export markets for any country which: (1) engages in predacious official export financing through the use of tied or partially untied aid credits; and (2) impedes negotiations to eliminate the use of such credits for commercial purposes. Declares that the Secretary of the Treasury: (1) should avoid using the Fund to finance only one or two export projects; (2) should seek to use the Fund to finance only U.S. exports that would be reasonably competitive in the absence of the predatory export financing practices of the other country; and (3) shall ensure that the Fund is used only to assist certain U.S. entities or entities wholly owned by U.S. citizens. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies in: (1) determining the foreign countries which offer predacious tied or partially untied aid credits and which impede negotiations to restrict their use to legitimate foreign aid; and (2) reviewing proposed uses of the Fund.

Requires the ITC to review and report on developments in an industry that thus received import relief for as long as the import relief remains in effect. Authorizes interim relief after a petition for import relief is filed if the USTR determines that: (1) it is likely that the article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the competing domestic industry; and (2) the absence of such interim relief would result in irreparable harm to the domestic industry. Authorizes an import relief petitioner who alleged injury from imports of a perishable product to file a request with the Secretary of Agriculture that emergency action be taken with respect to that product. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to decide, within 20 days: (1) whether there is reason to believe that the perishable product is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of, or threat of, serious injury to the competing domestic industry; and (2) if there is such reason to believe, whether emergency action is warranted.

Classifies a coalition or trade association which represents either processors or processors and producers as interested parties in such investigations. Requires the ITC, in determining whether material injury occurred in an antidumping or countervailing duty case, to assess cumulatively the volume and effect of imports from two or more countries of like products if such imports compete with each other and with like products of the domestic industry in the U.S. market and if such imports: (1) are subject to any countervailing or antidumping duty; or (2) during the preceding 12 months were subjected to a final order, suspension agreement, or quantitative restraint resulting from such an investigation. Adds to the factors that the ITC must consider in determining whether threat of material injury exists: (1) evidence of export targeting by a foreign government; (2) the extent to which the United States is a focal point for exports because of market barriers in third countries; and (3) in dumping cases, dumping findings in other countries against the same exporter. Requires the ITC in such dumping cases to request information from the foreign exporter or U.S. importer on threat of material injury.

Sets forth the grounds for granting such relief. Prohibits disclosure (except to certain ITC and Customs Service employees) of confidential information submitted to the ITC during the course of an investigation without the consent of the petitioner. Requires the principal negotiating objectives with respect to intellectual property rights to be: (1) to seek enactment and effective enforcement by foreign countries of laws that protect intellectual property; and (2) to develop and strengthen international rules and dispute settlement procedures against trade-distorting practices arising from inadequate national protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Amends the patent laws to make it an infringement of patent to use, sell, or import into the United States without authority a product produced by a patented process. Places the burden of proof upon the party asserting that a product was not produced with the patented process in an infringement action where the court finds a substantial likelihood that the product was so produced and the claimant has exhausted all means of discovery. Federal Laboratory Technology Utilization Act of 1986 - Authorizes Federal agencies to permit their laboratories to enter into cooperative research and development arrangements with other Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, industrial organizations, or other persons including licensees of inventions owned by the Federal agency or general partners of research and development limited partnerships.
