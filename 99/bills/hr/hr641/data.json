    "text": "Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to prohibit a Federal agency from issuing certain leases affecting a coastal State unless the Governor certifies that an agreement meeting certain requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act has been reached with the Secretary of such agency. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to provide that revenues generated by the Federal leasing of lands located within three miles of the seaward boundaries of a coastal State shall be shared equally between the State and Federal Government. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from leasing areas located within three miles of the seaward boundaries of a coastal State if the Secretary and the Governor disagree whether such areas contain oil or gas pools underlying both the Outer Continental Shelf and lands subject to the State's jurisdiction. Directs the Secretary to deposit in a separate account in the Treasury (for annual distribution to a coastal State) 50 percent of the revenues attributable to oil and gas pools underlying both the Outer Continental Shelf and submerged lands subject to the State's jurisdiction. Declares that all funds deposited in a separate Treasury account under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prior to the enactment of this Act shall be divided equally between the Federal Government and the appropriate coastal State."
