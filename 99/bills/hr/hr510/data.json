    "text": "Professional Sports Franchise Stabilization Act of 1985 - Declares it to be unlawful for any professional sports franchise which has played its home games in a metropolitan area for six consecutive years or more to relocate, unless: (1) the owner provides written notification of such intention to the local government authority at least 120 days before the scheduled relocation; (2) a party to the stadium lease agreement fails to comply with a significant provision and such noncompliance cannot be remedied within a reasonable period of time; (3) the stadium is inadequate and the stadium authorities demonstrate no intent to remedy the inadequacies; (4) the franchise has incurred annual net losses for the preceding three years, or has incurred losses in a shorter period that endanger its financial viability; and (5) the owner makes a good faith offer to sell the franchise to the local governmental authority (or the person the authority selects). Authorizes governmental authorities in metropolitan areas to bring a civil action to prevent a professional sports franchise relocation. Directs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to conduct periodic oversight hearings on the effects of this Act."
