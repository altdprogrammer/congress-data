    "text": "Amends Federal defense procurement provisions to require the Secretary of Defense to provide that a contract for the production of a major defense system or major munitions program may not be entered into until live-fire testing of such program is completed. Establishes within the Department of Defense (DOD) a Director of Live-Fire Testing (the Director). Requires the Director, before full-scale engineering development of a major defense system or major munitions program begins, to: (1) review such plan; (2) report to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (the Under Secretary) concerning such plan; and (3) review the adequacy and progress of live-fire testing of such system. Requires the Director to carry out programs to improve the conduct of live-fire tests by DOD. Gives the Director: (1) authority to observe any live-fire test conducted by the Secretary of a military department; and (2) access to all live-fire data and reports. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to carry out live-fire testing of each major defense system or major munitions program for which such Secretary is responsible. Directs the Secretary concerned, before the full-scale engineering development of a system or program is begun, to submit to the Director the plan, schedule, and proposed funding for the live-fire testing of such system or program. Requires the Secretary concerned, after such live-fire testing is completed, to submit a report to the Director concerning such testing. Outlines information to be included in each such report. Authorizes the Director to carry out further live-fire or surrogate testing if necessary. Requires the Director, before production of a covered system or program begins, to submit to the Under Secretary a report on each live-fire test conducted with respect to that system or program. Outlines information to be included in each such report. Provides each Member of the Congress with access to all test data and reports."
