Requires agencies to transfer all unclaimed property to the Administrator of General Services for disposition. Directs the Comptroller General to report annually, beginning June 30, 1987, to an authorized State officer (upon the request of such officer) all relevant information concerning unclaimed property in which the State may be interested if: (1) such State certifies that it is a lawful custodian and entitled to the unclaimed property; and (2) the Comptroller General is satisfied that the United States is protected against any claim if the State escheats or acquires lawful custody of such property. Sets forth procedures for the recovery of unclaimed property by States. Authorizes appropriations as necessary to the Comptroller General and the General Services Administration to carry out this Act. Makes conforming amendments to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and certain provisions of military law concerning the disposition of unclaimed property."
