Makes a provision relating to transfers pursuant to a change in bargaining representative inapplicable to trucking industry plans.

Provides that specified provisions for adjustments in accrued benefits are not applicable to any such benefit. Amends a corresponding provision in the Internal Revenue Code. Establishes a trucking industry pension benefit guaranty fund. Sets forth provisions for premium rates, cessation of premium payments, and assessments in lieu of premiums. Exempts trucking industry plans from certain requirements if other requirements relating to merger and transfers of multiemployer plans are met. Revises provisions for special withdrawal liability rules for the building and construction industry. Revises provisions for multiemployer plans withdrawals to provide for a limitation on withdrawal liability in cases in which withdrawal results from a change in bargaining representative and a transfer of assets and liabilities is not required. Makes conforming and technical amendments. Revises provisions for conditions under which a sale of assets does not result in withdrawal liability. Revises provisions relating to effective dates and special rules.
