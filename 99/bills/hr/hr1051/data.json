    "text": "Provides for binding arbitration when negotations on a new collective bargaining agreement between the Federal Government and a labor union representing Federal employees are at an impasse on the date of expiration of their current agreement. Requires each party to such negotiations to select an individual to serve on an arbitration board. Requires the two selected members to jointly select one other member to serve as chairman. Sets forth the procedure for selecting an arbitration board when more than two parties are involved. Sets forth a schedule for the board to issue a final report containing findings, conclusions, recommendations, and the new collective bargaining agreement which shall be binding on all parties. Requires the board, if it recommends a solution which requires the enactment or amendment of a Federal statute, to report such recommendation to the Congress. Declares that any subsequently enacted legislation relating to such recommendation preempts any related provision considered binding under the new agreement. Requires the parties to such agreement to reopen negotiations to make conforming amendments."
