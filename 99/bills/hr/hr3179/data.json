    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employees and employers to make contributions to a cost-of-living arrangement to supplement a defined benefit plan. Defines a qualified \"cost-of-living arrangement\" as an arrangement under a defined benefit plan which indexes a benefit provided under such plan or a separate plan subject to certain requirements. Requires that participation in such an arrangement must be elective. Provides that transfers to a cost-of-living arrangement shall not be taken into account for purposes of lump-sum distribution. Disallows an income tax deduction for employee contributions to a cost-of-living arrangement."
