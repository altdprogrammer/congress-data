    "text": "Conscientious Employee Act - Makes it unlawful for an employer to take retaliatory action against an employee because the employee: (1) discloses or threatens to disclose an activity, policy, or practice of the employer that the employee reasonably believes evidences violation of a law, rule, or regulation or endangers the health or safety of employees or the general public; (2) provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation by the employer; or (3) objects to, or refuses to participate in, any activity, policy, or practice which the employee reasonably believes violates a law, rule, or regulation, endangers public health or safety, or significantly compromises the recognized tenets and ethics of the employee's profession or occupation. Makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise or the attempt to exercise any action protected under this Act. Requires notification to a supervisor, except under specified circumstances, for the protection against retaliatory action to be applicable. Provides for enforcement by civil action, including punitive damages and civil penalties. Requires employers to post notice of the pertinent provisions of this Act."
