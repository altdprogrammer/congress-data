Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct and report to the Congress on a study of: (1) the amount of overstatement of deductions or credits attributable to the use of cars or other types of property which have substantial personal use; and (2) methods for reducing such overstatements which would impose less paperwork burdens on taxpayers than a requirement of contemporaneous records."
