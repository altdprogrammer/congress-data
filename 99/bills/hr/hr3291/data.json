    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Government Operations with amendment, H. Rept. 99-602) Federal Civilian Employee and Contractor Travel Expenses Act of 1986 - Title I: Travel Expenses of Federal Civilian Employees - Revises provisions regarding travel and subsistence expenses for Federal employees and consultants by replacing current per diem allowance rates to the extent feasible with rates to be established by locality. Entitles an employee traveling on official business to a per diem allowance and appropriate travel expenses if such employee returns home or to the workplace because of a personal emergency situation. Authorizes such transportation expenses to an employee who travels to a location for medical services or where the emergency situation exists. Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to prescribe conditions under which an employee who serves in a law enforcement capacity and/or members of the employee's family may be provided a subsistence allowance and travel expenses when occupying temporary living accommodations because of a threat to life or property resulting from the employee's assigned duties. Requires that regulations to implement the preceding provisions of this Act be transmitted to the appropriate congressional committees. Declares that such regulations shall not take effect until 30 days after such transmittal. Directs the Administrator to periodically, but at least every two years, submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an analysis of information on agencies spending more than $5,000,000 annually on travel and transportation. Terminates such reporting requirement upon the submission of an analysis that includes FY 1991. Declares that Postal Service employees transferred to an agency for permanent duty may be authorized travel expenses to the same extent as other transferred employees. Title II: Travel Expenses of Government Contractors - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to provide that travel costs for contractor personnel shall not exceed rates and amounts set for civilian employees, or those set by the Administrator or the President. Directs the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to report to the appropriate congressional committees on whether limitations should be placed on payments by executive agencies to Government contractors for costs incurred by contractor employees for transportation and relocation. Title III: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective dates of various provisions of this Act."
