    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1986-09-30", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 - Prohibits, as of July 1, 1987, any person who operates a commercial motor vehicle from having more than one driver's license, except in certain circumstances. Requires commercial motor vehicle operators who have violated motor vehicle traffic control laws of a State other than the license-issuing State to: (1) notify the latter State of such violation; and (2) notify the operator's employer of such violation. Requires commercial motor vehicle operators to notify employers of any suspension or loss of: (1) commercial motor vehicle driving privileges; and (2) previous employment as a commercial motor vehicle operator. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish by regulation the period (not less than ten years) for which notice of such previous employment must be given. Prohibits employers from authorizing to operate a commercial motor vehicle any employee who: (1) has lost the right to drive such vehicles; or (2) possesses more than one commercial motor vehicle driving license. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations by January 1, 1989, establishing minimum Federal standards for testing the fitness of commercial motor vehicle operators. Prescribes guidelines for such standards. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to a State which agrees to establish a program for testing the fitness of commercial motor vehicle operators. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program. Outlines the funding and eligibility guidelines for such grant program for FY 1987 through 1989, and for years after FY 1989. Provides that grant recipients: (1) in FY 1987 through 1989 may only use grant funds to develop a program for testing and ensuring the fitness of commercial motor vehicle operators; and (2) in FY 1990 and thereafter may only use grant funds for testing commercial motor vehicle operators. Presents guidelines for the development of such commercial motor vehicle operators testing program. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations by January 1, 1989: (1) establishing minimum uniform standards for the issuance of classified drivers' licenses by the States; and (2) establishing an information clearinghouse pertaining to the licensing, identification, and driving status of commercial motor vehicle operators. Requires the Secretary to review State-operated information systems to determine whether any such system could be used within the Federal system. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the appropriate States for the use of such system. Outlines the requirements of the Federal information system. Identifies the offenses for which a commercial motor vehicle operator's driving license shall be subject to Federal disqualification. States that the Secretary does not have to disqualify an operator if the license-issuing State has disqualified such operator in accordance with the Federal requirements. Sets October 1, 1994, as the deadline by which each State must comply with the Federal standards for commercial motor vehicle operators in order not to have apportioned funds withheld. Details the requirements of such standards. Requires the Secretary to withhold highway funds apportionments from States that do not comply with this Act by September 30, 1994. Provides for release of withheld funds to States complying by September 30, 1994. Establishes criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any provision of this Act or any regulation issued thereunder with respect to class of persons or commercial motor vehicles if the Secretary determines that such waiver is not contrary to the public interest. Requires the Secretary to review, by January 1, 1989, the commercial motor vehicle alcohol regulations to determine whether such regulations should be applied uniformly throughout the United States. Requires the Secretary, within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, to revise certain Federal Highway Administration regulations to require trucks and truck tractors manufactured after July 24, 1980, to have brakes operating on all wheels. Requires the Secretary to conduct a radar demonstration project on a certain highway in northern Kentucky, and to report the results of such project to the Congress."
