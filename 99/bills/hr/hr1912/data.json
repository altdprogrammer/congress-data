Permits producer crop acreage base adjustments. Permits the Secretary to suspend acreage limitations when market factors or emergencies demand. Requires program participation in order to receive price support assistance. Directs the Secretary to provide through the county committees for a farm program yield for each crop based on the preceding five years. Sets forth related county committee recordkeeping responsibilities. Title II: Price Support Levels for Program Crops and Reconciliation with Permanent Law - Applies the provisions of this Act to wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. Makes conforming amendments to specified agricultural Acts.
