    "text": "Pesticide Import and Export Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to specify the types of information a pesticide producer must submit to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on pesticides manufactured in and exported from the United States. Requires the Administrator of EPA to cooperate and collaborate with the Secretary of State, Secretary of Agriculture, and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in identifying overseas pesticide use patterns on food crops exported to the United States. Requires the Administrator to prepare an annual report summarizing such information. Requires that information on pesticide exports be kept confidential except as it must be disclosed to comply with reporting requirements. Prohibits considering a pesticide in violation of this Act even though the Administrator has cancelled, suspended, denied, or restricted the use of the pesticide or the use of the pesticide has been voluntarily cancelled or suspended if the Administrator, after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Agriculture, and before export determines that the foreign country has: (1) requested the pesticide; (2) disclosed to the Administrator the specific intended use of such pesticide in such country; (3) informed the Administrator of educational procedures for users of the pesticide; and (4) if the pesticide will be used on food crops exported to the United States, informed the Administrator of regulatory requirements imposed on the use of such pesticide that might affect the nature and level of pesticide residues on such crops. Requires the Administrator, upon receipt of such information, to provide such country with information regarding: (1) restrictions on the use of such pesticide in the United States; (2) the nature and estimated severity of any unreasonable adverse effects identified by the Administrator; (3) the availability of regulatory and scientific documents concerning such pesticide; and (4) in the case of an acutely toxic pesticide, the acute hazards associated with exposure to such pesticide. Prohibits the use of a temporary tolerance established as part of an experimental use permit from covering pesticide residues on imported foodstuffs. Requires the Administrator to revoke the tolerances for residues: (1) associated with cancelled, suspended, or denied uses of a pesticide; or (2) if the tolerance is no longer needed or supported by the available scientific data. Provides for automatically revoking a tolerance within 180 days of cancellation or suspension of use of a pesticide or if a pesticide registration or registration application is voluntarily withdrawn. Directs the Administrator to establish a residue action level at the time a tolerance is revoked if the Administrator determines that: (1) residues of the pesticide will unavoidably persist in the environment; and (2) such action levels will not pose an unreasonable adverse effect on man or the environment. Directs the Administrator to: (1) cooperate with international efforts to develop improved and uniform pesticide research and regulatory programs; and (2) provide countries which import pesticides from the United States with technical assistance."
