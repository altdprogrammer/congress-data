    "text": "Education Improvement for Pacific Islands and Territories Act - Requests the President to invite Pacific Island participants (i.e. Fiji, Papua New Guinea, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau) to participate with the United States in the establishment of the Institute for Pacific Islands Education. Authorizes the President to use funds appropriated pursuant to this Act to assist the establishment and initial development of the Institute. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Institute should: (1) be an educational center located at the University of Guam and financed in part by that University; and (2) have specified functions relating to faculty development, administration, and improvement of the universities, colleges, and secondary schools of the Pacific Island participants. Directs the President to encourage increased enrollment at U.S. institutions of higher education in courses of study in faculty development or university, college, and secondary school administration by individuals from Pacific Island participants who indicate a commitment to return to their respective Pacific Island participants and improve the universities, colleges, and secondary schools there. Directs the President to identify appropriate individuals for such enrollment and provide information to them with respect to that course of study. Authorizes the President to pay transportation and living expenses for up to 50 such individuals at any one time who are enrolled in such course of study. Declares that the President should encourage such individuals who enroll in such course of study to spend a period of residence at the Institute. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1989."
