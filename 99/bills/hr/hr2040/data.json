Rept. 99-170 (Part I)) Nuclear Waste Fund Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Energy for expenditure from the Nuclear Waste Fund for the following activities: (1) a first repository development; (2) a second repository development; (3) monitored retrievable storage; (4) transportation and systems integration; and (5) program management. Prohibits such authorizations from being used for expenditures relating to: (1) implementation of any monitored retrievable storage proposal until the Congress specifically authorizes the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility; or (2) development of surface facilities for packaging, treatment, or storage of spent nuclear fuel other than at the site of a repository or civilian nuclear power reactor. Directs the Secretary of Energy to transfer from the Nuclear Waste Fund to the Treasury general fund the amounts appropriated to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and determined by such Commission for expenditure in FY 1986 and 1987. Directs the Secretary to evaluate a range of possible schedules for high-level radioactive waste acceptance and for repository disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Prescribes assessment guidelines for such evaluation. Prohibits the Secretary from obligating amounts from the Nuclear Waste Fund to incorporate nuclear waste acceptance schedules in high-level radioactive waste disposal contracts until: (1) the submission of a comprehensive report of such evaluation to the Congress; and (2) a 90-day period of continuous congressional session has expired following such submission."
