Directs the President to promptly notify the Congress of any action taken in response to such recommendations. Directs the Secretary of each military department to assign all forces under their jurisdiction (except forces assigned to recruiting, organizing, training, or supplying the armed forces) to unified and specified combatant commands as established under this Act.

Title II: Defense Agencies - Directs the Secretary, in appropriate cases, to provide for the performance by one agency or organization of supply or service activities common to more than one military department.

Directs the Secretary to establish career guidelines for officers in the joint specialty. Directs the Secretary to establish policies to ensure that officers being considered for senior military positions shall be required to have joint specialty experience.

Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for monitoring the careers of officers in the joint specialty or other joint officers. Requires the Chairman of JCS to advise the Secretaries of the military departments with respect to the duty assignments of officers in the joint specialty and other joint officers. Requires the Secretary to establish personnel policies emphasizing training and experience in joint matters for reserve officers not on the active-duty list. Requires the Secretary to include in the annual report to the Congress certain information regarding activities within the joint specialty for the previous year. Sets forth the promotion policy for joint service officers (including faster promotions). Revises provisions concerning the review of promotion lists by the Chairman of JCS to allow the Chairman, in a limited number of instances, to recommend for promotion officers who: (1) have served in joint assignments; and (2) were considered by a review board but not recommended for promotion. Allows the Secretary of the military department concerned to disagree with the Chairman's promotion recommendations. Requires the Secretary concerned to record their disagreement as part of their transmittal to the Secretary of Defense of the selection board's report. Requires the Secretary of Defense to resolve any such disagreements before transmitting the report to the President.
