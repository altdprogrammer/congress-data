    "text": "Education, Job Training, and Youth Shelters for the Homeless Act - Amends the General Education Provisions Act to require State and local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide free public education for homeless children. Requires each state education agency to implement a plan to ensure that each homeless child within the State is provided full and equal educational opportunities. Requires LEAs to ensure that qualified school personnel interview families and children in shelters or other temporary housing within their district to determine the educational needs of homeless children. Prohibits any State or local residency requirement from being applied so as to bar any homeless child from attending school. Grants the parents of each homeless child the choice of continuing the child's education in the district of origin for the remainder of the school year or enrolling the child in the school district where the child is actually living. Requires that each homeless child be provided adequate transportation to the school selected. Requires that the records of each homeless child be maintained so that they are immediately available when a child enters a new school district. Requires LEAs to ensure that each homeless child may participate in all educational programs and services. Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to include homeless individuals under the definition of economically disadvantaged. Requires that proper consideration be given to the extent to which JTPA service providers will provide services in locations that are convenient to homeless individuals, and that consideration also be given to providing training in housing rehabilitation. Includes homeless individuals among those encountering barriers to employment. Amends the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to define \"providing temporary shelter\" as providing shelter until permanent shelter can be provided elsewhere."
