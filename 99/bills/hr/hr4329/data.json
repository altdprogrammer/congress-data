Authorizes the United States to make contributions to the Fund only if the President each fiscal year makes a specified certification to the Congress relating to the Board of the Fund and to the disbursements from the Fund. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on the degree to which: (1) the Fund has contributed to reconciliation between the communities in Northern Ireland; (2) the U.S. contribution to the Fund is meeting its objectives; and (3) the Fund has increased respect for the freedoms of all people in Northern Ireland. Imposes certain requirements relating to funds for international organizations and conferences."
