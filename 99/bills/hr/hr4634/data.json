    "text": "Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1986 - Authorizes appropriations to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for FY 1987 and 1988 for research, development, and demonstration activities authorized under: (1) the Clean Air Act; (2) the Federal Water Pollution Act; (3) the Safe Drinking Water Act; (4) the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (5) the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); (6) the Public Health Service Act (radiation activities); (7) interdisciplinary activities provisions; (8) the Toxic Substances Control Act; and (9) energy research. Authorizes appropriations to the EPA Office of Research and Development for FY 1987 and 1988 for program management and support. Sets forth permissible uses of such funds. Provides for congressional oversight of transfers of funds between categories. Prohibits the Administrator of the EPA from using any funds appropriated under this Act for a reduction-in-force, unless the Administrator has provided certain information to the Congress in advance. Directs the Administrator of the EPA to establish and maintain a separately identified program of continuing long-term environmental research and development that will support and contribute to each research category for which appropriations are authorized under this Act. Requires that at least 15 percent of such funds be obligated for such long-term research and development. Directs the Administrator to report annually on the performance of such long-term research and development programs to the appropriate congressional committees at the time the President's FY 1988 budget is submitted to the Congress. Directs the Administrator to carry out a research program with respect to indoor air quality. Requires that such program be designed to: (1) gather data and information on all aspects of indoor air quality in order to contribute to the understanding of health problems associated with the existence of air pollutants in the indoor environment; and (2) coordinate Federal, State, local, and private research, development, and demonstration efforts relating to the improvement of indoor air quality. Authorizes the Administrator to establish committees of representatives of appropriate Federal agencies and advisory groups of representatives of the scientific community, industry, and public interest organizations to assist in carrying out such indoor air quality research program. Directs the Administrator to consult and coordinate with State and local officials and other interested parties having concerns related to such program. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress an indoor air quality research implementation plan within 120 days after enactment of this Act and a final report within two years of such enactment after consulting the National Academy of Sciences. Directs the Administrator to establish the Committee on Biotechnology within the Science Advisory Board. Requires such committee to report to the Congress on biotechnology product assessment. Requires the Board to review and report on the EPA's groundwater research program."
