Permits a person who brings a civil action for such a violation to proceed with the action if the Government does not do so within 60 days (currently six months) after entering an appearance. Directs the court to dismiss the action if the Government fails to proceed, upon discovering the action is based on evidence or information the Government had as a basis for allegations made in a prior proceeding. Requires the court, if the Government proceeds with the action, to award the person who brings such action an amount which the court deems reasonable for disclosing new evidence or information. Requires that such award be at least 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement. Requires the court, if the Government does not proceed with the action, to award such person an amount which the court deems reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. Requires that such award be at least 50 perent ot the proceeds of the action or settlement. Requires that such person also receive an amount for reasonable expenses the court finds to have been necessarily incurred and costs awarded against the defendant."
