Defines the health-care income threshold for an individual, and the current maximum annual rate of pension for a veteran. Provides that, in any case in which a veteran is furnished care or services for certain specified non-service-connected disabilities, the United States has the right to recover the reasonable cost of such care or services from a third party to the extent that veteran would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such third party if the care or services had not been furnished by a department or agency of the United States. Enumerates the non-service-connected disabilities for which such third-party payments apply. Subrogates the United States to any right or claim that the veteran may have against a third party.

Permits the Administrator, for limited purposes, to make available clinical records of a veteran to a third party insurer to verify that services for which recovery or collection is sought were furnished. Amends the Federal veterans' benefits provisions to require any non-Federal provider of hospital services to any Medicare beneficiary to also accept Veterans Administration (VA) beneficiaries on a similar basis, and to accept payments from the VA as payments in full. Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services any noncompliance with health care provision agreements by such a non-Federal provider. Authorizes the Secretary to then terminate such agreement after a finding of noncompliance.
