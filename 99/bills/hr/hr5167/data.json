Requires all gross receipts (including, but not limited to, bonuses, rents, and royalties) that are derived by the United States with respect to such lands to be administered in accordance with the laws relating to trust property. Requires all applications for mineral leases involving such lands pending on the date of enactment of this Act to be rejected and advance payments returned to the applicants. Provides that nothing in this Act shall: (1) deprive any person (other than the United States) of any lease, right-of-way, mining claim, grazing permit, water right, or other interest in such lands before enactment of this Act; (2) affect a specified right-of-way; or (3) affect specified mineral leases. Requires, subject to existing rights, that specified mineral leases (oil and gas) be administered under regulations of the Secretary of the Interior to the same extent and manner that such leases would be administered if this Act had not been enacted."
