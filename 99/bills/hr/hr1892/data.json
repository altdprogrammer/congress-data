Sets forth the method to be used in analyzing the causes of the trade imbalances. Requires the Mission to submit its report to the Congress within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Prohibits representatives of the United States, during such 180 day period, from negotiating regarding, or agreeing to, any trade concession by the United States to Japan or any nation where the trade deficit with the United States exceeds reasonable limits. Limits the number of motor vehicles that may be imported from Japan during any 30 day period during that 180 day period."
