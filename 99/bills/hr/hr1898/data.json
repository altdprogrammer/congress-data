    "date": "1985-04-02", 
    "text": "Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1985 - Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act to prohibit the issuance of competitive coal deposit leases if the applicant holds coal deposit leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, which have not been producing coal in commercial quantities for a period of ten years. Exempts from such prohibition leaseholders who: (1) agree to relinquish such non-productive coal leases; or (2) pay an additional rental on coal deposits being acquired and hold non-compliance coal leases issued before August 4, 1976. Terminates at the end of ten years 20-year leases that are not producing coal in commercial quantities unless the tenth lease year is extended through payment of advance royalties. Sets guidelines for the assessment of such royalties. Provides that such advance royalty payments constitute compliance with this Act's diligent operation requirements. Repeals the requirement that an operation and reclamation plan must be submitted within three years after a lease is issued. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate rules regarding experimentation with the negotiated sale of leases for bypass and maintenance tracts. Prohibits the disclosure of coal-tract value data by Department of the Interior personnel to anyone not associated with the Department. Imposes criminal penalties for disclosure violations. Directs the Comptroller General to report semiannually to the Congress regarding management and enforcement of coal production on leased lands for a period of five years after enactment of this Act."
