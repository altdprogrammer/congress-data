Requires reports concerning such study by the Director to the appropriate congressional committees, at specified periods. Requires the Administrator, not later than 24 months after the date of approval of the protocol approved by the Director, to report to the appropriate congressional committees concerning such study, together with recommendations. Requires the Administrator, within 90 days after the submission of each such report, to publish in the Federal Register any actions proposed by the Administrator with respect to programs administered by the Veterans Administration. Specifies that this Act does not authorize the enactment of new budget authority for a fiscal year before FY 1987. Outlines terms for a contract to carry out such study."
