Requires such grants to provide half the funding for such centers. Requires the Secretary to give preference to States which intend to use as sites for international trade development centers land-grant colleges which: (1) operate agriculture programs; (2) have existing international trade programs; and (3) have a communications system that might be linked on an international basis to conduct conferences on trade negotiations. Provides that such centers may: (1) establish a permanent data base to address the problems faced by potential exporters; (2) be used to house exhibits on agricultural products produced in the United States; and (3) carry out certain other activities."
