Sets forth examples of such projects.

Requires that selections be from among qualified persons who have: (1) applied directly to the land managing agency; (2) been referred directly by a State employment security service or by a sponsor of an Indian program or of a migrant or seasonal farmworker program; or (3) been listed on a master referral list maintained by the Secretary according to specified guidelines. Requires that membership selection preference be given to minority youths and to youths residing in rural or urban areas having substantial youth unemployment. Limits the period of Corps enrollment for any member to 24 months, which may be served either continuously or in two or three shorter terms. Permits members to complete a continuous term after attaining age 26. Prohibits enrollment solely for school vacation periods. Sets forth provisions for the establishment of residential and nonresidential Corps camps, including provisions for Corps camp management. Provides that Corps members and crew leaders shall be deemed Federal employees only for purposes of: (1) the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., social security and unemployment); (2) title II of the Social Security Act (Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Benefits); (3) Federal employees workers' compensation; and (4) Government liability in tort claims. Permits Corps members to volunteer to enlist in armed forces reserves or in National Guards, except that periods of active duty shall not be considered as time served in the Corps.

Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or enter into agreements for the funding and operation of Corps camps with Federal, State, or local agencies or tribal organizations which certify that specified requirements shall be met. Directs the Secretary to give selection preference to projects which: (1) can be planned and initiated promptly; (2) will be labor-intensive; (3) will provide meaningful work experience to the Corps members involved; and (4) will provide long-term benefits to the public. Directs the Secretary to try to ensure an equitable distribution of projects among the States based on relative populations of youth of eligible ages. Directs the Secretary to dispense or expend at least 50 percent of the sums appropriated to carry out this Act pursuant to agreements with State, local, or Indian land managing agencies. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish standards for specified pay rates for Corps members and crew leaders and reasonable hours and conditions of employment; (2) provide for the collection and sale of biomass recovered by Corps camp projects; and (3) arrange, with the assistance of the Secretary of Education, for academic credit awards for Corps experience and for academic study by Corps members.
