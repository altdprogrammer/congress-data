    "text": "Social Security Minor and Technical Changes Act of 1985 - Amends the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 to: (1) extend the Secretary of Health and Human Service's authority to waive compliance with the benefit requirements under titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act in connection with certain demonstration projects; and (2) require that the Secretary's final report shall not be due until June 9, 1990, with respect to such projects. Requires a State's Medicaid program (title XIX of such Act) to provide medical assistance to disabled widows and widowers who are not eligible for benefits under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of such Act because of certain amendments of the Social Security Amendments of 1983. Directs the Secretary to appoint a special Disability Advisory Council to conduct studies and make recommendations with respect to the medical and vocational aspects of disability under both titles II and XVI of such Act. Exempts from taxation the social security benefits of certain citizens of U.S. possessions. Treats an adopted greatgrandchild the same as an adopted grandchild for purposes of title II of such Act. Revises the definition of \"balance ratio\" under title VII (Administration) of such Act. Extends the reentitlement period for a disabled child. Revises provisions relating to: (1) work deductions affecting auxiliary benefits in disability cases; and (2) the disability offset. Provides, with respect to voluntary agreements for OASDI coverage of State and local employees, that in certain cases agreements or modifications of an agreement with the Secretary can be mailed to the Secretary."
