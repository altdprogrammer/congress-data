    "text": "Civil Service Retirement Reform Act of 1985 - Amends the provisions of the civil service retirement system to exclude employees of the District of Columbia. Provides for computing an employee annuity based on five consecutive years of creditable service. (Currently, such annuity is based on three consecutive years.) Eliminates crediting unused sick leave when computing the annuity of a retiring employee. Requires eligible individuals to apply for a deferred annuity. (Currently, such annuity is automatic at age 62.) Sets forth a formula for reducing the annuity of an employee who retires before age 65. Revises the method of computing cost-of-living increases by taking into account the adjustment in the rates of pay of the General Schedule taking effect in the same fiscal year. Establishes a base annuity amount for the full payment of such increase. Eliminates survivor benefits for students in post-secondary schools. Changes eligibility requirements for survivor benefits for widows, widowers, and insurable designees by requiring such persons: (1) to have attained age 60; (2) if disabled, to have attained age 50; or (3) to be providing care for a child of the deceased. Eliminates provisions which established a minimum annuity. Establishes a method for determining the amount to be contributed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund by the United States Postal Service and the District of Columbia government. Excludes District of Columbia employees from Federal health benefits and life insurance benefits. Sets forth effective dates and transition procedures under this Act. Prohibits a cost-of-living increase from taking effect in FY 1986."
