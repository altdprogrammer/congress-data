    "text": "Terrorist Prosecution Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal criminal code to punish anyone who in an act of international terrorism kills or attempts to kill any national of the United States in any foreign country or in international waters or airspace. Requires any such person who is found guilty of murder in the first degree to be sentenced to imprisonment for life and anyone found guilty of attempted murder to be imprisoned for not more than 20 years. Makes it an offense for any person in an act of international terrorism to assault, wound, strike, imprison, endanger, or make any other violent attack upon the person or liberty of any U.S. national in any foreign country or in international waters or airspace (or make violent attack on his or her premises, private accommodations, or means of transport). Provides for a fine of not more than $5,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than three years. Increases the fine to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for ten years if a deadly or dangerous weapon is used. Makes it an offense punishable by up to life imprisonment to: (1) conspire to murder a U.S. national who is in a foreign country or in international waters or airspace; or (2) conspire, while outside the United States, to murder a U.S. national within the United States. Authorizes the Attorney General to receive assistance of any Federal, State, or local agency (including the military) in enforcing this provision."
