    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-01-03", 
    "text": "Port Development and Navigation Improvement Act of 1985 - Authorizes a non-Federal interest to submit a plan and design for a navigation project for a port to the Secretary of the Army (who shall act through the Chief of Engineers). Requires the Secretary, not later than 180 days after receipt of such plan, to transmit to the Congress the results of the review. Provides for: (1) the reimbursement of the non-Federal interest for the cost of developing such plan; or (2) crediting such costs to the non-Federal share of a deep-draft port project which is to be built by the Secretary. Authorizes a non-Federal interest to construct any navigation project for a port authorized by this Act or any other Federal law, and to acquire lands as necessary, if: (1) the Secretary approves the project plans; and (2) the non-Federal interest agrees to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of operation and maintenance. Directs the Secretary to regularly monitor and audit the project while under construction, and to reimburse the non-Federal interest for the Federal share of the costs if such project is carried out substantially in accordance with approved plans. Directs the Secretary, on written request from an appropriate non-Federal interest, to initiate procedures to establish a schedule for consolidating Federal, State, and local agency environmental assessments and the issuance of construction permits. Includes within such schedule a memorandum of agreement between affected Federal, State, and local agencies which establishes a schedule of compliance for approval of the project and associated permits. Prohibits such schedule from exceeding two and one-half years from the date of agreement. Requires the Secretary, six months before the final date of the schedule, to submit to the appropriate congressional agencies a progress report on the work completed under the agreement. Requires the Secretary to notify the non-Federal interest of the final decision on project approval and related permits not later than the final day of the schedule. Declares that the preceding provisions do not apply to portions of the Saint Lawrence Seaway administered by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. Sets forth the Federal share of specified costs of navigation projects for a port. Requires that the non-Federal share of costs be paid to the Secretary and that construction costs be paid annually. Authorizes appropriations necessary for reimbursements and the Federal share of costs beginning with FY 1986. Authorizes the Secretary, on appropriate application, to guarantee the obligation issued by the non-Federal interest under specified circumstances. Sets forth the terms and conditions for such loan guarantees. Establishes the Federal Port Navigation Project Financing Fund, consisting of amounts assessed as guarantee fees. Makes amounts in the Fund available for the payment of loan defaults. Sets forth the authorities of the Secretary in the event of a loan default. Allows any navigation project for a port to be constructed in usable increments. Grants the consent of the Congress to the levy by a non-Federal interest of tonnage duties on vessels entering a deep-draft port to: (1) reimburse the United States for the non-Federal share of, and to finance, construction and operations and maintenance costs; and (2) provide emergency response services. Sets forth restrictions on such levying. Requires the non-Federal interest to maintain appropriate records to enable the Comptroller General to carry out required periodic audits with respect to the levy of tonnage duties. Requires the results of such audits to be reported to the Congress. Grants original and exclusive jurisdiction over matters resulting from the levy of tonnage duties under this Act to the U.S. district court for the district in which the affected non-Federal interest is located. Sets forth procedures for enforcement of the collection of tonnage duties, including withholding clearances and imposing maritime liens. Requires each non-Federal interest to provide the United States the information necessary for military readiness planning and port and national security. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to a non-Federal interest operating a port project for the provision of emergency response services. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and following fiscal years."
