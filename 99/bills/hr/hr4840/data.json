Requires such pilot program to be established within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, but not before October 1, 1986. Requires each Secretary to designate one military installation within the Secretary's jurisdiction for participation in such pilot program. Authorizes each Secretary to enter into agreements with rental unit lessors in order to carry out this Act. Outlines provisions to be included in such agreements. Authorizes any Secretary who compensates a lessor under this Act to garnish the wages of the member involved for an amount equal to the compensation paid to the lessor. Directs the Secretary of Defense, within 18 months following the establishment of such pilot program, to report to the Congress concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of such program. Terminates the authority of any Secretary to enter into lease guarantee agreements with lessors under this Act 18 months after the establishment of the program."
