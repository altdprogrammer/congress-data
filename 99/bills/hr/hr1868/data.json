Permits a State to exclude from Medicaid participation any individual or entity excluded under Medicare pursuant to the patient and program protection provisions. Requires a State in order to receive Federal payments with respect to a health maintenance organization (HMO) to exclude any HMO that: (1) could be excluded because of the conviction of the owners or managers of certain crimes; or (2) contracts with any individual or entity convicted of such crimes. Prohibits Federal payments with respect to any amount expended for items or services furnished by or at the direction of any individual or entity excluded from Medicaid participation because of the patient and program protection provisions. Prohibits a State under title V from making payments with respect to any amount expended for items or services furnished by or at the direction of any individual or entity excluded from participation pursuant to the patient and program protection provisions of title XI.

Revises disclosure requirements under part A of title XI. Revises Medicare provisions concerning agreements with providers. Modifies the Medicaid moratorium provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 to consider a State's Medicaid plan to include any plan change and any policy or guideline delineated in the State Medicaid operation or program manuals submitted to the Secretary either before or after the enactment of that Act and whether or not approved or disapproved by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to restore, for the duration of the moratorium, the policy in effect at the beginning of the moratorium regarding the period when homeownership by an institutionalized individual is permitted and the time permitted for the sale of a home. Amends the Medicare program to provide payment to beneficiaries for services rendered by an individual or entity which has been excluded from Medicare participation if such beneficiary did not know or have reason to know of the exclusion. Revises the definition under title XI of a \"person with an ownership or control interest\" in a provider of services under title V, XVIII, or XIX to limit reporting on ownership interests to those interest at or exceeding five percent of the entity's assets. Authorizes the Secretary or a State to impose an intermediate sanction on a provider or supplier whose noncompliance with its Medicare or Medicaid participation agreement does not immediately threaten patient health and safety by denying it payment for services it provides after receiving notice of the sanction and before correcting its deficiencies. Authorizes the Secretary and the States to deny Medicare and Medicaid payments to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and competitive medical plans (CMPs) for new enrollees when more than 50 percent of the organization's members are Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. Permits the Secretary to assess civil money penalties against HMOs and CMPs which: (1) charge an enrollee for more than is permitted; (2) fail to provide an enrollee with covered, medically indicated treatment; (3) disenroll beneficiaries in an impermissible manner; (4) engage in any practice reasonably expected to exclude from enrollment Medicare or Medicaid-eligible individuals likely to need substantial future medical services; and (5) misrepresent or falsify enrollment information. Provides that individuals who knowingly and willfully (currently, the intent must be knowing or willful) make a false statement or misrepresent a material fact in the sale of Medicare supplemental health insurance shall be guilty of a felony. Authorizes the Secretary to deny Federal payments for Medicaid services provided by an individual or entity that fails to furnish information required under Medicare or Medicaid. Makes the Medicaid utilization control requirements for long-term stays in health facilities applicable to a consecutive stay which occurs on more than one fiscal year. Subjects a physician who fails to provide medically necessary services or supplies, or fails to admit a beneficiary based on the amount of services or length of stay required, to civil monetary penalties if: (1) the failure adversely affects the health and safety of the individual; and (2) the hospital provides incentives to the physician to limit the hospital stay of or services provided to the patient. Subjects the hospital which provides physician incentives in such circumstances to civil monetary penalties. Requires a hospital participating in Medicare to provide the Secretary with a detailed description of any physician incentive plan. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress by 1988 regarding the need to expand prohibitions to encompass other physician incenative plans which result in inappropriate hospital discharges or service reductions. Exempts providers who are paid on a risk basis under the Medicare or Medicaid program and participate in group purchasing organizations (GPOs) as well as vendors furnishing goods and services to such GPOs from the Acts anti-kickback provisions if the GPO has a written agreement with each such hospital, provider, and vendor to disclose all payments it recieves. Exempts certain hospitals which waive the Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) deductible or coinsurance requirements from anti-kickback provisions. Requires such hospitals to develop and adhere to written guidelines regarding the waiver of such deductible or coinsurance amount. Amends part B (Peer Review) of title XI to require peer review organizations (PROs) to conduct a preadmission review on a substantial sample of individuals to determine whether the inpatient setting is appropriate when a hospital has waived cost-sharing requirements. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress within two years of enactment of this Act on the impact the requirements imposed on hospitals which waive deductibles or coinsurance amounts have on beneficiary access and competition in health care. Directs the Secretary to promulgate final regulations within 18 months of enactment of this Act specifying other payment practices which shall not be considered as violating the Act's anti-kickback provisions. Sets forth effective date provisions. Title II: Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Amendments - Subtitle A: Provisions Relating to Medicare - Amends the Medicare program to adjust the diagnosis-related group (DRG) categories and weighting factors for FY 1988 and at least once every fiscal year thereafter. (Currently, such adjustments must occur at least once every four years.) Authorizes the Secretary to recalibrate individual DRGs in response to changes affecting the relative use of hospital resources. Directs the Secretary to rebase the prospective payment system (PPS) rates for FY 1988 to reflect the reasonable costs reported by urban and rural hospitals in hospital cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1984 under the reasonable cost payment methodology then in effect. Requires the Secretary to maintain the PPS hospital cost reporting system through FY 1993. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year of this Act's enactment on ways to improve the hospital cost reporting system. Requires the inclusion of Puerto Rican hospitals into the PPS. Sets the prospective payment rate for such hospitals at 75 percent of the Puerto Rican standardized rate and 25 percent of the national standardized rate, providing for adjustments necessitated by certain cost and care variations among hospitals. Exempts Puerto Rican hospitals from restrictions regarding direct medical education payments for foreign medical graduates. Requires the restandardization of national payment rates to include Puerto Rican hospitals without increasing aggregate PPS payments by reason of such inclusion. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year of enactment of this Act regarding the need for special adjustments for nonlabor costs, such as supplies and equipment. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a separate DRG for the implantation of penile prosthesis; and (2) adjust the heart pacemaker DRGs to distinguish between dual-chamber or functionally similar pacemakers, and single-chamber pacemakers. Varies the portion of prospective payments set-aside for outlier payments to urban, rural, and regional hospitals to take into account variations in the portion of outlier payments received by such differently situated hospitals. Directs the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission to study and report to the Congress by April 1, 1987, regarding: (1) possible PPS modifications to better accommodate outliers for burn cases; and (2) the need for separate payment rates for burn center hospitals. Provides for an increase in payment rates for burn outliers until new rates are established pursuant to the Commission's study. Extends indefinitely the provision providing an additional payment to sole community providers experiencing an annual decrease of more than five percent in patient volume due to circumstances beyond their control. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year of enactment of this Act regarding new payment methodologies which appropriately address the problems of sole community hospitals and other low-volume rural hospitals. Requires regulatory impact analyses to include a specific analysis of the impact of all proposed Medicare and Medicaid regulations on small rural hospitals. Directs that with regard to hospitals in States which were PPS-exempt by reason of a waiver lasting until the close of calendar year 1985, the Secretary shall determine regional referral center status on the basis of data for the first nine months of 1986. Provides for the inclusion of the services of a clinical psychologist as inpatient hospital services. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend the requirement that Medicare-participating hospitals participate in CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services) and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Veterans' Administration) to hospitals with Medicare agreements entered into before the enactment of such Act. Requires the Secretary to: (1) designate an office to coordinate the development of studies on quality of care under PPS; and (2) establish a task force to assist in the development of an agenda for quality studies. Sets forth reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) submit a legislative proposal to the Congress by 1988 to improve PPS and the outlier payment system so that such systems more adequately account for variations in severity of illness and case complexity; (2) report to the Congress within two years of enactment of this Act as to whether current hospital Medicare participation standards are adequate to assure the quality of hospital services; (3) assess and report to the Congress by 1988 regarding the need for a separate payment to hospitals for administratively necessary days (days of inpatient hospital care due to the unavailability of nursing home space); (4) develop and report to the Congress within one year of enactment of this Act regarding a uniform needs assessment instrument which evaluates an individual's need for post-hospital extended care services, home health services, and long-term care services of a health-related or supportive nature; and (5) include in the annual PPS report to the Congress information on the quality and patient access to Medicare post-hospital services. Amends the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 to permanently waive, for hospices which began operation before 1975, the requirement that Medicare certified hospices limit inpatient care days to no more than 20 percent of patient care days. Requires such hospices to limit inpatient care days to no more than 50 percent of patient care days. Amends the Medicare program to allow hospitals which are attempting to qualify for additional Medicare payments by reason of having served a disproportionate share of low-income patients to demonstrate that general payments made by State and local governments to defray the operating deficit of the hospital were related to indigent care. Requires the Director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to appoint two additional members to the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission within 60 days of this Act's enactment. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to delay until 1988 the requirement that laboratory services provided in a physician's office be paid on an assigned basis. (Currently such requirement goes into effect in 1987.) Provides Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) coverage of anesthesia and related care provided by a certified registered nurse anesthetist. Authorizes payments equal to 80 percent of an amount determined under a fee schedule established by the Secretary and adjusted so as to maintain the total payments for such care at the level they would have attained pursuant to the prior reimbursement scheme. Requires nurse anethetists to accept assignment for all Medicare services. Provides part B coverage of physician-supervised services performed by a physician's assistant in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or as an assistant at surgery. Requires assigned payments to be made to the employer of the physician assistant. Includes the services of a clinical psychologist within the definition of covered rural health clinic services even if such services are not furnished under a physician's supervision.
