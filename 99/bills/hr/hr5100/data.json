    "text": "Omnibus Family Decency Protection Act of 1986 - Title I: Criminal Penalties and Related Provisions - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide criminal penalties for the distribution of obscene matter. Subjects such obscene material, and any property derived from such material, to forfeiture. Permits the Postal Service to carry out such forfeitures if the violation involves the mails. Provides criminal penalties for obscene television broadcasts. Requires any person who produces, distributes, or sells any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct to maintain records containing proof of ages of the persons depicted. Provides criminal penalties for violations of such recordkeeping requirements. Provides criminal penalties for producing a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct using performers between the ages of 18 and 21. Provides criminal penalties for using a computer network to exchange information concerning visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide criminal penalties for making an obscene or indecent communication for commercial purposes to any person without his or her consent. (Current law provides such criminal penalties if made to minors without their consent.) Amends the National Labor Relations Act to make the employment of any person to participate in a commercial sexual performance an unfair labor practice. Amends the Mann Act to make certain offenses gender neutral. Title II: Children's Justice Provisions - Children's Justice Act - Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to assist in developing, establishing, operating, or implementing programs for: (1) handling child abuse cases; and (2) improving procedures for protecting children from abuse. Requires each State requesting such a grant to establish a multidisciplinary task force on children's justice. Lists certain procedures a State might implement to: (1) reduce trauma to the child victim in child abuse cases; (2) improve the chances of suscessfully prosecuting child abuse cases; and (3) protect children from abuse. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare a summary of the approaches to improve the investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases in a manner which reduces the trauma to the child victim; (2) develop model training materials to ensure that law enforcement, legal, judicial, and child welfare personnel are trained to deal with child sexual abuse victims; and (3) support research projects to assist in identifying effective approaches to achieving the objectives of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1988. Requires the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and of Education, and other department and agency heads designated by the President to meet every six months to coordinate Federal programs dealing with child abuse. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress annually on such activities. Directs the Attorney General to modify the classification systems used by the National Crime Information Center, the Identification System used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Uniform Crime Reporting System, with respect to offenses involving the sexual exploitation of children, by: (1) including the age of the victim and the relationship of the victim to the offender; and (2) using a uniform definition of child. Amends the Public Health Service Act regarding the confidentiality of certain alcohol and drug abuse treatment records to state that such confidentiality requirements do not supersede State or local requirements for the reporting of incidents of suspected child abuse."
