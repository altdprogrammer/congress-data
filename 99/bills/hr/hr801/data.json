Requires, for purposes of eligibility, that the taxes and rent paid by such individuals exceed five percent of their adjusted gross income. Limits such credit to $500 for the taxable year. Reduces the credit by five percent of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $10,000 in 1982, $15,000 in 1983, and $20,000 in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984."
