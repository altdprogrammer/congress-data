Requires public notice of adverse affects of lead exposure, including means of mitigation. Requires States to enforce such requirements within two years or be subject to civil action. Prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Administrator of Veterans Affairs from insuring or guaranteeing a mortgage for newly constructed residential property which is not in compliance with such requirements. Amends the Federal Hazardous Substances Act to designate solder with a certain lead content as a hazardous substance. Requires such solder to be labelled with the prohibitions of this Act."
