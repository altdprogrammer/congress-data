    "text": "Coast Guard Defense and Personnel Protection Act - Requires civilian personnel employed at the Coast Guard Yard (Maryland) and at the Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (North Carolina): (1) to be managed each fiscal year solely on the basis of workload and available funds; and (2) to be exempt from any statutory or regulatory manpower constraints. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (the Secretary) to identify those Coast Guard activities that are necessary to maintain the logistics capability of the Coast Guard. Requires the Secretary, no later than January 31, 1987, to provide a list of such activities to the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Provides that such activities may not be contracted for performance by non-Government personnel, except in specified circumstances. Requires the Secretary, before the beginning of FY 1987 and 1988, to submit to the above committees a list of activities that are to be contracted for performance by non-Government personnel during that fiscal year. Prohibits any Coast Guard vessel or major component of such vessel from being constructed in a foreign shipyard, unless the President makes authorized exceptions based on national security. Requires the President to notify the Congress of any such exception, and requires 30 days to pass after such notice before any contract for foreign construction may be entered into."
