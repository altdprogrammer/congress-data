R. 4746), roll call #167 (340-36)) Housing Act of 1986 - Declares that this Act and the amendments it makes may not be construed to provide for new budget authority, budget outlays, or new entitlement authority for FY 1986 or 1987 in excess of the appropriate aggregate levels established by the budget resolution for such fiscal year for the programs the Act authorizes. Title I: Program Extensions and Amendments - Subtitle A: General Extension of Programs - Extends through FY 1987 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance programs under the National Housing Act; (2) rehabilitation loans under the Housing Act of 1964; (3) rural housing loans under the Housing Act of 1949; and (4) flood and crime insurance under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the National Housing Act. Subtitle B: Mortgage Insurance and Secondary Mortgage Market Programs - Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (the Secretary) to fix premium charges for FHA mortgage or loan insurance, but not more than certain percentages of principal calculated according to specified formulae. Permits the Secretary to insure a mortgage secured by a one- to four-family dwelling, or approve of a substitute mortgagor who assumes any mortgage, only if the mortgagor is to occupy the dwelling as a principal or secondary residence. Excludes from eligibility certain public and private nonprofit investors. Authorizes the Secretary to insure any mortgage secured by property within the Allegany Reservation of the Seneca Nation of New York Indians which is subject to 99-year leases under specified Federal law. States that any such mortgage insurance shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund. Makes mortgages on Hawaiian homelands and Indian reservations General Insurance Fund obligations (currently they are under the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fun). Extends refinancing insurance authority to cover nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and board and care homes. Provides that if the State agency is not empowered to certify the need for a nursing home, intermediate care facility, board and care home, or hospital, then the Secretary shall accept in lieu of certification a feasibility study which demonstrates such need. Increases from ten to 20 percent of the aggregate number of insured mortgages and loans for the preceding fiscal year the ceiling on the aggregate number of such insured mortgages and loans for any particular fiscal year. Specifies certain actions which the Secretary must take to reduce losses under the single family mortgage insurance program. Raises the fine for equity skimming from $5,000 to $250,000, and the possible prison sentence from a maximum of three years to a maximum of five years. Makes equity skimming on cooperatives and condominiums subject to such penalties. Revises the definition of one kind of equity skimming practice to mean failing to make payments under the mortgage or deed of trust as the payments become due, regardless of whether the purchaser is obligated on the loan. Authorizes the Secretary to impose civil money penalties on a mortgagee for certain violations of requirements of such Act, up to a maximum of $1,000 per violation, or $1,000,000 for all violations by a particular mortgagee during a one-year period. Provides for judicial review of an agency determination to assess such penalties. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a demonstration program of insurance of home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners. Prescribes the requirements and procedures of such a program. Limits the authority of the Secretary to enter into commitments to insure loans and mortgages to the extent of any amounts provided in appropriations Acts for the fiscal year in question. Requires the Secretary to maintain at least one office in each State to carry out such Act, in order to assure adequate processing of loan and mortgage insurance applications. Prohibits the Secretary from closing any State office until at least 30 days after the completion of any investigation, study, or review by any Federal agency or congressional committee of the proposal or determination to close such office. Prohibits (with specified exceptions) fees from being charged on: (1) Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) mortgages; (2) Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guarantees; or (3) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation mortgages. Subtitle C: Community and Neighborhood Development and Conservation Programs - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 with respect to the classification of metropolitan cities and urban counties. Extends through FY 1987 the authorization of appropriations for community development block grants and urban development action grants. Requires the Secretary to allocate funds appropriated to the discretionary fund for grants to institutions of higher learning to continue FY 1984 programs of assistance to economically disadvantaged and minority students participating in community development work study programs who are enrolled in full-time graduate or undergraduate programs in community and economic development. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, to pay ineligible costs incurred with respect to a certain model cities grant. Revises urban development action grant selection criteria to add certain job-creation and minority small business considerations. Specifies points to be awarded for each factor in consideration and the percentage of fund distribution to applicants meeting different criteria. Requires the Comptroller General to report every three years to the Congress an evaluation of such selection criteria and the eligibility standards to which they apply. Prohibits the use of urban development action grants for business relocations. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1987 for the urban homesteading program. Prohibits the charging of fees on rehabilitation loans. Amends the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act to authorize FY 1986 and 1987 appropriations for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. Amends the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 to authorize FY 1986 and 1987 appropriations for the neighborhood development demonstration program. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to direct the Secretary to enter into a 180-month contributions contract to provide assistance payments on behalf of 250 lower income families in FY 1986 and an additional 250 lower income families in FY 1987 as long as they occupy properties in the Park Central New Community Project or in adjacent areas within the Park Central New Town In Town Project. Makes funds available for such fiscal years for community development grants for such project. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous Program Amendments - Extends through FY 1987 the authorization for: (1) certain studies under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968; (2) the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank; and (3) certain research programs under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to or enter into contracts with State or local governments and certain other public or private entities with programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices in order to develop and coordinate fair housing initiatives under the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

Directs the Secretary to collect at least annually data on the racial and ethnic characteristics of persons eligible for or benefiting under each community development, housing assistance, and mortgage and loan insurance and guarantee program the Secretary administers. Declares that it is U.S. policy that each HUD prime contractor should establish procedures to ensure the timely payment of subcontractors. Directs the Secretary, within six months after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on fees collected during the previous four years for inspecting manufactured homes under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Title II: Housing Assistance - Subtitle A: Programs Under United States Housing Act of 1937 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to increase the aggregate amount of budget authority available for lower-income housing rental rehabilitation and development grants. States that any recaptured Indian Housing Funds may only be used for other Indian housing projects. Authorizes public housing agencies (PHAs) to determine, with the Secretary's approval, (as an alternative to the existing schedule) monthly rents, which do not exceed the maximum allowable rent contribution and do not exceed either the average monthly debt service and operating expenses for similarly-sized projects or the section 8 fair market rent in the area. Defines \"rent\" to mean: (1) the amount payable by a family to a PHA for shelter; and (2) in any case in which a family is required to make a separate utility payment, an annual utility allowance. Authorizes the Secretary to make annual contributions to PHAs. Limits such contributions to a sum equal to the annual amount of principal and interest payable on PHA obligations issued to finance development costs. Authorizes the Secretary to make contributions in grant form to PHAs to cover public housing project development costs. States that contract terms and conditions shall remain in effect for a 40-year period.
