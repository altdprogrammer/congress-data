Revises the definition of \"economically disadvantaged\" to base determinations of income eligibility on a 12-month (rather than a six-month) period prior to application. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary), within 30 days after enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations to permit the exclusion of any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family resulting from a foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy in determination of income eligibility for programs under the Act. Includes mental health care and counseling among supportive services under the Act. Includes State and local agricultural agencies and social service agencies under the Governor's coordination and special services plan. Requires such plan to provide, where appropriate, for: (1) collecting and disseminating to service delivery areas information on the number of permanent dislocations of farmers and ranchers due to farm and ranch failures; and (2) identifying farm and ranch family members in need of retraining and job search assistance, on a State and local basis. Includes rural areas under designated areas for which certain labor market projections are to be made. Requires inclusion of individuals who are geographically isolated due to rural residence under eligibility provisions for part A (Adult and Youth Programs) of title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) of the Act. Prohibits requiring States to match grants from the Secretary's discretionary funds under title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers) of the Act. Includes as eligible for dislocated worker assistance individuals who were self-employed (including farmers) and who are or will be unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which they reside or because of natural disasters. Directs the Secretary to establish categories of self-employed individuals and of economic conditions and natural disasters. Provides that farmers may qualify for eligibility by certifying or showing that the farm's operations will terminate because of specified kinds of circumstances. Revises provisions for national and multistate programs to include: (1) information networks and cooperation among Federal, State, and local programs; (2) coordination at the national level among Federal agencies responsible for administering interrelated employment, training, and support services; (3) regional or nationwide efforts to foster economic development or employment generating activities in rural areas; and (4) national and regional programs addressing the special problems of dislocated farmers. Revises research and demonstration provisions to include references to dislocated farmers, farm spouses, changes in the agricultural sector, and easing the transition from farming to other work places. Provides for seeking improved methods of collecting data and accounting for employment and unemployment in rural areas. Includes dislocated farmers under pilot project provisions. Revises cooperative labor market information program provisions to take into account both urban and rural areas. Directs the Secretary to collect specified types of statistical data relating to permanent dislocation of farmers and ranchers due to farm and ranch failures. Directs the Secretary to publish an annual report based upon such data, including: (1) a comparison with data currently used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in determining the Nation's annual employment and unemployment rates; and (2) an analysis of whether farmers and ranchers are being adequately counted in such employment statistics. Includes the Secretary of Agriculture under interdepartmental cooperation provisions. Includes the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Economics on the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. Adds to the functions of the National Commission for Employment Policy the evaluation of: (1) the effectiveness of federally assisted employment and training programs in rural America; (2) employment difficulties inherent to rural areas; (3) rural needs for employment generating activities; (4) the employment, training, and vocational education needs of dislocated farmers; (5) the current system used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for collecting rural employment and unemployment data; and (6) current Federal coordination efforts in administering federally assisted employment and training programs."
