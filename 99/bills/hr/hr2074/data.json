Sets forth criminal penalties for illegal ticket sales and the sale of counterfeit tickets. Makes Federal lottery provisions inapplicable to this Act. Establishes the National Lottery and Deficit Reduction Trust Fund to consist of amounts received from lottery ticket sales and fines imposed under criminal penalties. Directs the Secretary to invest portions of the Trust Fund not required for current withdrawals in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. Requires that proceeds from such investments be credited to the Trust Fund. Declares the following purposes for amounts in the Trust Fund: (1) 75 percent to reduce the principal on the Federal debt; (2) 20 percent to pay prizes; and (3) five percent for administration and operation. Authorizes appropriations as necessary for FY 1986. Authorizes the mailing of lottery tickets and materials for purposes of this Act."
