Retains the exemption of motor common carriers of household goods from certain antitrust laws. Sets forth guidelines under which the Commission shall issue certificates and permits to motor common carriers of household goods authorizing them to provide transportation. Grants the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) jurisdiction over: (1) motor carrier safety and productivity; and (2) interstate and intrastate transportation provided by National motor carriers of property and National private carriers of property (National carriers).

Prohibits any State or interstate agency from enacting provisions regarding intrastate or interstate rates, routes, or services of motor carriers of property, including National carriers, with the exception of household goods carriers or motor private carriers. Establishes in the Department of Transportation the Motor Carrier Administration to be administered by an Administrator who shall report directly to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to: (1) promptly inspect the safety compliance record of persons applying for authority to provide transportation of passengers or household goods; (2) establish safety fitness requirements; (3) maintain safety compliance records to determine the continued safety fitness of interstate owners and operators of commercials motor vehicles, interstate motor carriers of property, and National carriers; and (4) enforce compliance and issue orders against imminent hazards to safety. Grants the Secretary safety jurisdiction over the commercial operations of National carriers.

Prohibits a common carrier, in an agreement for damages limitation, from providing for specific amounts to be deducted from any claim presented by a shipper for loss or damage. Establishes in the Department of Transportation a working group composed of State officials representing agencies with expertise in vehicle registration, fuel tax, and certain other tax practices affecting the truck industry.
