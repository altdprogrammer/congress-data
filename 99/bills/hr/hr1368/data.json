Sets forth procedures for expedited judicial review. Prohibits such a court from granting injunctive relief against any actions pursuant to this Act except in conjunction with a final judgment. Provides that a review of judgments, decrees, or orders may be had only upon direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Prohibits the bringing of any action to enjoin work on such construction, unless the petitioner provides a bond. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary, pending appropriation of such sums, to allot necessary amounts from existing Army department civil works appropriations."
