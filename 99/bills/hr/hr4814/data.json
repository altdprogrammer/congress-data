Requires regulations governing appraisals to reflect nationally recognized appraisal standards and the differences between acquisition appraisals and transfer appraisals. Permits each Secretary to exchange land or interests of approximately equal value if to do so would be in the public interest and expedite the exchange. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1997 for land exchange activities. States that lands acquired through exchange shall be given the same status as the Federal lands exchanged for such lands. States that the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act shall remain unaffected by this Act."
