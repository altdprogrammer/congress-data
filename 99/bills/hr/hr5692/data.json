Makes a State eligible for assistance if such State has enacted statutes with respect to the investigation and adjudication of child abuse which: (1) minimize the additional trauma to the child victim; and (2) improve the chances of successful criminal prosecution or legal action. Requires that such assistance be used to implement these statutes. Establishes a formula based on State population to determine the amount of the State's allotment. Requires the Attorney General to use up to $12,000,000 from the Crime Victims Fund each fiscal year for this purpose. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to increase the level of the Crime Victims Fund. Directs the Attorney General to acquire statistical data for 1987 and 1988 regarding the incidence of child sexual abuse and annually publish a summary of such data."
