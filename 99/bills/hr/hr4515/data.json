Limits FY 1986 obligations for direct loans and related advances for minor improvements to farm housing and buildings. Disapproves the proposed deferral D86-60 relating to the Farmers Home Administration, Rural Housing Insurance Fund, as set forth in the message transmitted to the Congress by the President on March 12, 1986. Directs the Secretary to return specified funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. Directs the Secretary to transfer up to a specified amount from the CCC to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for a cost-sharing program with Florida for: (1) compensation for infected nursery stock destroyed in fighting the outbreak of citrus canker in 1984; and (2) current and continuing operating expenses of a citrus canker eradication and control program. Requires any funds previously transferred to the citrus canker program from other than CCC accounts to be returned immediately. Requires the Secretary to transfer specified CCC funds to the Cooperative State Research Service to meet the matching funds requirement for development of an international trade center at Oklahoma State University. Directs the Secretary to use up to a specified amount of CCC funds to control and eradicate avian influenza. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make deficiency payments to farmers for the 1986 crop of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice if the Secretary determines that: (1) the farmers are prevented from planting because of flood, heavy rains, excessive moisture or drought; and (2) the farms are located in an area designated as a disaster area. Requires deficiency payment amounts to be deducted from crop insurance indemnity payments. Permits borrowers to prepay loans made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Rural Electrification Administration, by using private capital with the existing loan guarantees, provided each borrower certifies that prepayment will result in substantial savings to its customers or lessen the threat of bankruptcy of the borrower. Provides that no prepayment penalties may be charged against the borrower, the Administration, or the Rural Electrification and Telephone Revolving Fund. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to exclude from the definition of \"wetland\" any lands in Alaska identified as having high potential for agricultural development and which have a predominance of permafrost soils.

Requires specified funds appropriated under the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1986 to be obligated as supplemental funds for a homeless shelter in Middlesex County, New Jersey and for the Will County Local Development and the Illinois and Michigan Canal Commission in Illinois. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, upon the request of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority, Seattle, Washington, to authorize the sale or lease of the Fairley Group Building without affecting the Federal assistance provided under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, if the transfer documents provide for the continued use of the building as a public market during the expected useful life of the building. Waives specified requirements of OMB Circular A-102 Attachment N so long as the Building remains in the control of the public authority and is used as a public market during its expected life. Makes supplemental appropriations for FY 1986 to the Department of Commerce for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
