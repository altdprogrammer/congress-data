Disallows such amortization if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that: (1) fraud or criminal abuse by the bank led to such loss; (2) the bank's capital-to-total financial assets ratio is less than three percent; or (3) the bank has failed to make good faith efforts to design a recapitalization plan to strengthen its capital-to-total financial assets ratio."
