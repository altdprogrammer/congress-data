Requires that one-half of the cost of providing such education and training to employees be provided by the employer, with the remainder to be provided in cash or in kind by the educational or training institution.

Title IV: Tax Provisions - Subtitle A: Tax Incentives for Research, Education, and Employment - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent the exclusion from income of employer provided educational assistance. Provides that the $5,000 limitation on the exclusion of employer educational assistance shall not apply to graduate teaching assistants. Makes permanent the research credit.

Requires an employee to be employed for 14 days or more in order for the wages to qualify for the targeted jobs credit. Extends the authorization of the targeted jobs credit through FY 1988. Subtitle B: Enterprise Zones - Enterprise Zone Enterprise Development and Employment Act of 1986 - Part I: Designation of Enterprise Zone - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the designation of enterprise zones by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for purposes of extending the tax incentives and regulatory flexibility measures provided by this Act.

Provides that the Secretary may designate such zones only if: (1) the area is within the jurisdiction of the local government; (2) the boundary of the area is continuous; (3) the area has a population of at least 4,000 if any portion thereof is located within a standard metropolitan statistical area (with a population of at least 50,000), or 1,500 otherwise, or is within an Indian reservation; and (4) the area meets specified unemployment and poverty requirements. Requires nominating local governments, as a condition of the Secretary's designation, to agree in writing to follow a course of action which may include reducing tax rates, improving local services, simplifying or streamlining regulation of business, receiving commitments of private entities to assist employees and residents of the area, permitting State and local income tax deductions for fees for services performed by a nongovernmental entity formerly performed by a governmental entity, giving special preference to contractors owned and operated by members of a minority, and giving surplus land in the enterprise zone to neighborhood organizations agreeing to operate a business on the land.

Requires that any property tax reduction effected by a local government under the terms of this Act be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of a State or local government for Federal assistance or benefits. States that designation of an enterprise zone shall not give displaced persons from such an area any rights or benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Treats any area designated as an enterprise zone as a labor surplus area under Federal law. Part II: Federal Income Tax Incentives - Subpart A: Credits for Employers and Employees - Allows employers located in enterprise zones a nonrefundable income tax credit for increased employment expenditures and employment of the disadvantaged. Allows a three-year carryback and a 15-year carryover of such credit. Sets the amount of such credit at ten percent of the increase in payroll (taking into account a maximum of $17,500 in wages per year per employee) plus 50 percent of the wages paid to certain disadvantaged workers for the first three years of the enterprise zone designation. Phases out such economically disadvantaged credit. Disallows a deduction for the portion of the wages or salaries taken into account for such credit. Requires that where there is an early termination of employment by an employer in the case of qualified economically disadvantaged individuals, the tax for that taxable year in which the termination occurred must be increased by the tax credits allowed for such employees. Allows employees located in enterprise zones a nonrefundable income tax credit equal to five percent of qualified wages earned per year (taking into account a maximum of $10,500 in wages per year). Phases out such credit. Subpart B: Credits for Investment in Tangible Property in Enterprise Zones - Allows businesses an additional investment tax credit for investments made in certain enterprise zone construction property located in enterprise zones. Limits such credit to ten percent for new enterprise zone construction property, including rental property. Requires that the property subject to such credit be located in an enterprise zone, be predominantly used in the zone, be either constructed, reconstructed, renovated, etc. during the period of zone designation or acquired during such period, and not be acquired from relatives or related corporations. Requires the recapture of such credit upon the early disposition of the property. Provides for a phase-out of the enterprise zone tax credit as the enterprise zone ends. Provides for an adjustment to the basis of the enterprise zone construction property to reflect the enterprise zone tax credit. Subpart C: Nonrecognition of Qualified Enterprise Zone Capital Gain Where Acquisition of Enterprise Zone Business Property - Provides for the nonrecognition of capital gain on the sale of property where, within the one-year period beginning on the date of such sale, qualified replacement property is acquired by the taxpayer, to the extent the gain from the sale does not exceed the cost of the replacement property. Defines \"qualified replacement property\" as any personal property used predominantly in an enterprise zone in the active conduct of a trade or business within the enterprise zone, any real property located in the enterprise zone used in the active conduct of a trade or business, or any corporation, partnership, or other entity if, for the three most recent taxable years of such entity ending before the date of the purchase of such interest, such entity was a qualified business. Sets forth special rules for the operation of this provision. Requires the basis of the replacement property to be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of gain not recognized on the sale of such other property. Extends the period for the statute of limitations relating to the assessment of tax with respect to the sale of property involving the nonrecognition provisions.
