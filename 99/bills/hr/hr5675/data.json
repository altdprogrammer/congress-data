    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to require each State to develop a two-tiered plan to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from fossil fuel fired electric utility steam generating units in such State. Requires such plans to achieve specified emissions rates by the start of 1993 and the start of 1997. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct and update a comprehensive annual inventory of emissions from stationary sources. requires the Administrator to notify each State by the end of 1990 of potential reductions in stationary sources achievable by the end of 1996. Requires the Governor of each State to submit to the Administrator a plan for complying with such emissions reductions. Permits each State to achieve reductions through any emission limitation or other requirement. Requires each State to ensure that electric utility ratepayers in any region do not pay a disproportionate amount for such reductions. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress by June 30, 1993, on the actual reduction of acid deposition achieved by phase I reductions. Requires Administrator approval of any State plan granting a State a specified grace period within which to cure any defects in such plan. Requires a State without an approved plan to meet specified emission levels."
