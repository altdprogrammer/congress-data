    "text": "Japanese Technical Literature Act of 1985 - Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to: (1) monitor Japanese technical activities and developments; (2) consult with businesses and professional societies in the United States on their needs for information on Japanese developments in technology and engineering; (3) acquire and translate selected Japanese technical reports and documents that may be of value to Federal agencies and to businesses and researchers in the United States; and (4) coordinate with other Federal agencies to identify significant gaps and avoid duplication in Federal Government efforts to acquire, translate, and disseminate Japanese technical literature. Directs the Secretary to maintain such program, including an office in Japan, through the National Technical Information Service and other appropriate offices within the Department of Commerce. Requires that such acquisition and translation of Japanese technical reports and documents be performed only on a cost-reimbursable basis. Requires that such translations be performed only if they are not otherwise available within the private sector in the United States. Directs the Secretary, beginning in 1986, to report annually on important Japanese scientific discoveries and technical innovations in areas such as computers, semiconductors, biotechnology, and robotics and manufacturing. Directs the Secretary to consult with professional societies and businesses in the United States in preparing such reports. Authorizes the Secretary, to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts, to contract with private organizations to acquire and translate information relevant to the preparation of such reports. Directs the Secretary to encourage professional societies and private businesses in the United States to increase their efforts to acquire, screen, translate, and disseminate Japanese technical literature. Directs the Secretary to compile, publish, and disseminate an annual directory which lists: (1) all programs and services in the United States that collect, abstract, translate, and distribute Japanese scientific and technical information; and (2) all translations of Japanese technical documents performed by Federal agencies in the preceding 12 months that are available to the public. Directs the Secretary, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on Federal activities to collect, abstract, translate, and distribute declassified Japanese scientific and technical information. Amends the National Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986 to increase the amount authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for FY 1986 for the activities of the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation."
