    "text": "Childhood Vaccine Supply Protection Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to limit to $100,000 an award (for non-economic loss) in any action for damages for injuries relating to the administration of a vaccine providing immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, or rubella. Provides that no punitive damages shall be awarded in such actions. Preempts State laws inconsistent with this Act. Establishes an Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines to review: (1) the compensation policies under current law for vaccine-related injuries; (2) the current public and private systems for providing childhood vaccines; (3) research into the improvement of childhood vaccines and the development of new vaccines; (4) the dissemination of information concerning childhood vaccines; and (5) childhood vaccine programs in other countries. Directs the Commission to submit a report on the results of its review to the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
