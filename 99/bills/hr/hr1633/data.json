    "text": "Public Telephone System Bypass Access Charge Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require that any system of telephone access charges established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) include: (1) a special access charge of $25 a month or more for any line that indirectly interconnects with the exchange facilities of an exchange carrier; and (2) a bypass charge equal to 20 percent of the special access charge per line to be assessed on any person who, without direct or indirect interconnection with the exchange facilities of an exchange carrier, for commercial or governmental purposes, provides facilities and services comparable to the exchange access available from the exchange carrier. Sets forth exemptions. Requires persons subject to such charges to notify the appropriate exchange carriers, the FCC, and the appropriate State commissions. Prescribes penalties for evading such charges and for failing to comply with notification requirements. Provides that any person who pays to obtain exchange access directly from an exchange carrier for purposes of resale shall not be required to pay any additional amount for the exchange access for which payments have already been made indirectly. Requires that the non-traffic-sensitive costs apportioned to the interstate jurisdiction that are not recovered under the charges prescribed by this Act and the end-user common line charges be recovered through carrier common line charges. Limits to 25 percent the national aggregate percentage of non-traffic-sensitive costs that may be apportioned to the interstate jurisdiction. Directs the FCC to review and report to the Congress annually on the effects of the charges assessed under this Act, including information on whether the bypass charge allows for recovery of an equitable share of the costs of services and facilities of the exchange carrier that are available to the person subject to such charge on request or as an alternative to such person's facilities."
