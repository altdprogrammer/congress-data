Declares that any title to abandoned shipwrecks asserted under such conditions is transferred to the State in or on whose submerged lands the shipwreck is located. States that any abandoned shipwreck in or on the public lands of the United States (except the Outer Continental Shelf) is the property of the United States. Directs the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to publish, within six months after enactment of this Act, advisory guidelines for the protection of shipwrecks and properties."
