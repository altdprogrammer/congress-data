Sets forth the functions of the clearinghouse which includes: (1) identifying individuals and organizations that have experience with the collection of aggregate health care data; (2) collecting information on methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating such information; and (3) providing technical assistance in the use of such data. Prohibits funding for the operation of a clearinghouse after the end of the five-fiscal-year period beginning with FY 1986, unless extended by the Congress. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies on: (1) making aggregate health care data on the Medicare program more widely available; (2) applying existing analytic programs to the analysis of such data; (3) proposed changes in the aggregate health care data collected in the process of implementing Federal health care programs; and (4) proposed changes in the analytic programs used to analyze such data. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Congress a report on each study within six months of enactment of this Act."
