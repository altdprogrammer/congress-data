Requires the Secretary, within six months after the date of enactment of this Act, to publish in the Federal Register a list of the airports identified as especially vulnerable to terrorist threats, and to update such list at least every six months. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register and to publicize widely a travel advisory regarding such airports. States that with respect to international airports which fail to meet minimum security standards, the President shall prohibit: (1) U.S. air carriers from landing at such an airport; (2) all air carriers of the country in which the airport is located from landing at U.S. airports; and (3) the air carriers of all other countries from making direct flights between that airport and the United States. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions if a national security or humanitarian emergency requires such waiver. Directs the President to suspend assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act to any countries which are the sites of international airports which are officially listed as especially vulnerable to terrorist threats and have not met minimum international airport security standards. Permits the President to lift the travel advisory and sanctions only if the minimum international airport security standards have been met. Precludes the lifting of any sanction until 15 days after the Congress has been notified. Requires the Secretary to call for an immediate meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization to: (1) discuss international airport compliance with existing international security standards; (2) upgrade security standards for international airports; and (3) call on the member countries of the International Civil Aviation Organization to enforce such Organization's existing standards and impose a moratorium on the use of any international airport which does not comply with such standards. Directs the Secretary immediately to seek to renegotiate existing treaties regarding enforcement procedures with respect to aircraft hijacking and to establish an international sky marshal program."
