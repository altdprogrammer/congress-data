    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) District of Columbia Jury System Act - Amends the District of Columbia Code to establish a jury selection system for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia (the Court). Gives all litigants entitled to trial by jury the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of D.C. residents. Prohibits any type of discrimination in the D.C. jury selection process. Requires the D.C. Board of Judges (the chief and associate judges of D.C. Superior Court) to adopt a written jury system plan for the selection of jurors for the Court. Outlines provisions to be included in such plan. Requires such plan to provide for the maintenance by the Board of Judges (the Board) of a master juror list from which names of prospective jurors shall be drawn. Includes as qualified to serve as jurors individuals who are: (1) residents of the District of Columbia; (2) citizens of the United States; (3) 18 years of age or older; and (4) able to read, speak, and understand the English language. Disqualifies individuals: (1) determined incapable by reason of physical or mental infirmity; or (2) convicted of a felony or with a pending felony or misdemeanor charge, with specified exceptions. Provides for the mailing of a juror qualification form to each prospective juror. Sets forth actions to be taken against individuals who fail to complete and return such forms or misrepresent facts on such forms. Requires the Court at appropriate times to summon a sufficient number of prospective jurors to fulfill requirements for petit and grand jurors for the Court. Specifies actions to be taken against prospective jurors who fail to appear. Provides that an individual summoned for jury service may be excluded: (1) by the Court on specified grounds; (2) upon peremptory challenge; (3) upon a challenge by a party for good cause shown; or (4) upon certain determinations by the Court. Provides deferral from jury service only upon a showing of undue hardship, extreme inconvenience, public necessity, or temporary physical or mental disability which would affect service as a juror. Allows a party to challenge the composition of a jury by a motion for appropriate relief. Authorizes the Court to suspend proceedings until such challenges are determined and appropriate action is taken. Provides that length of service for jurors shall be determined by the master jury plan. Prohibits an individual from serving more than once in any 24-month period. Allows jurors to receive fees and expenses at rates established by the D.C. Council, without exceeding the rate established for jurors in the Federal system. Prohibits compensation as jurors to individuals who continue to receive regular compensation during such jury service as employees of the United States or of any State or local government. Protects jurors from all forms of employment discrimination by their regular employers on account of their jury service. Sets forth penalties for employer violations. Provides for the preservation of records and lists compiled and maintained in connection with the selection and service of jurors. Prohibits the disclosure of the contents of such records except in limited circumstances. Sets forth penalties for individuals who commit fraud in the processing or selection of jurors. Authorizes a grand jury serving in the District of Columbia to take cognizance of all matters brought before it regardless of whether an indictment is returnable in the Federal or D.C. courts. Authorizes the chief judge of the D.C. Court to order an additional grand jury in his or her discretion. Calls for cooperation between D.C. Superior Court and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the qualification, selection, and service of jurors."
