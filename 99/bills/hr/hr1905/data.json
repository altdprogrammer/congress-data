Directs the Secretary to include in such report appropriate legislative recommendations if the Secretary finds that coal imports are adversely affecting the management of the Federal coal leasing program and the economic condition of one or more sectors of the U.S. coal industry. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to grant duty-free treatment to: (1) coal from any country that has historically imported more coal from the United States than it has exported to the United States; and (2) coal produced in Colombia and imported into Puerto Rico. Imposes a duty on coal imported from other countries. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to add coal subject to such duty to the list of articles which cannot be designated as eligible articles for the Generalized System of Tariff Preferences."
