    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at the request of the Governor of a State affected by the interstate management plan developed under the Chesapeake Bay program, to make a grant to implement management mechanisms in the plan if the State has, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, approved and committed to implement all or substantially all aspects of the plan. Limits such grants to 55 percent of the plan implementation costs in any year. Requires the Administrator to continue the Chesapeake Bay Program to: (1) continue to assess the relationship between point and nonpoint source pollution and the impact of such pollution on water quality; and (2) do further research on the impact of pollutant loadings on the fisheries resources of the bay, with special attention given to the striped bass. Requires the Administrator to immediately begin to assess the principal factors having an adverse effect on the environmental quality of the Narragansett Bay and to direct the coordinate research and abatement programs that will efficiently address those factors. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1989 for such Chesapeake and Narragansett Bays programs."
