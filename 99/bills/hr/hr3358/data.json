Defines \"Atlantic striped bass.\" Directs the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (the Commission), during December of FY 1987 and each fiscal year thereafter, to monitor each coastal State's adoption and enforcement of such Commission's Striped Bass Plan. Requires the Commission to immediately notify the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior of any State's nonenforcement of such Plan. Requires the Secretaries, within 30 days after receiving such notification from the Commission, to jointly determine that State's compliance with the Plan, and, if the State is not in compliance, to jointly declare a moratorium on Atlantic striped bass fishing within that State's coastal waters. Extends the authorization of appropriations under, and effective date of, such Act through FY 1988. Extends the funding of certain striped bass population studies under the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act through FY 1988. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the State of Montana all rights, title, and interest in the Miles City National Fish Hatchery, near Miles City, Montana, such property to be used solely for fishery resources management programs."
