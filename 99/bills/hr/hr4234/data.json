    "text": "Armed Forces Combatant Command Reorganization Act - Amends general military law to direct the President to establish unified and specified combatant commands to perform military missions and to prescribe the force structure of such commands. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, if a situation warrants it, to establish a special combatant command. Requires the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to periodically (not less than every other year) review the overall structure of the unified and specified combatant commands and make appropriate recommendations to the President. Directs the President to promptly notify the Congress of any action taken in response to such recommendations. Directs the Secretary of each military department to assign all forces under their jurisdiction (except forces assigned to recruiting, organizing, training, or supplying the armed forces) to unified and specified combatant commands as established under this Act. Outlines provisions concerning the command hierarchy of such assigned forces. Provides that commanders of combatant commands shall be supervised by the Chairman of JCS and be responsible to the President and the Secretary of Defense for their missions. Makes the Secretary of each military department responsible for the support and administration of forces assigned by that department to combatant commands. Authorizes the commander of a combatant command to request the Secretary of Defense for the transfer to such commander of support or administrative functions. Directs the Secretary of Defense to include in the annual budget of the Department of Defense (DOD) a separate budget proposal for activities of each of the unified and specified combatant commands. Outlines information concerning activities of such combatant commands to be included in such proposals. Requires the commander of each such command to submit to the Chairman of JCS, for review and recommendations, annual program and budget proposals for such commands. Outlines provisions concerning the selection and tenure of combatant command subordinate commanders and staff officers. Establishes in DOD the Joint Commanders Council, consisting of the Chairman of JCS and the commanders of the combatant commands. Directs such Council to advise the Chairman, the President, and the Secretary of Defense on appropriate matters. Requires the Chairman of JCS to submit to the Secretary of Defense recommendations for the allocation of defense resources under the proposed national defense budget for each fiscal year, and to take certain other specified actions in connection with activities of the unified and specified combatant commands. Directs the Secretary of Defense (the Secretary) to provide for the transfer of staff personnel from the headquarters staff of the military departments to the staffs of the commanders of the specified and unified commands to reflect the reorganization made under this Act. Limits the total staff size of the unified and specified commands. Outlines actions to be taken into consideration at the first review of the structure of the unified and specified commands."
