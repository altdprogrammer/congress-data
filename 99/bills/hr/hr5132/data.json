Provides for an initial Treasury capitalization of $200,000,000. Sets forth Corporation authority. Terminates the Corporation ten years after enactment of this Act. Prohibits the making of any mortgage purchase commitments later than seven years after enactment of this Act. Provides for Treasury administration of any remaining Corporation assets or obligations.
