    "text": "Amends Federal law regarding toll roads, bridges, and tunnels to permit State imposition of tolls on Federal-aid highways without payback of any Federal-aid highway funds if: (1) the State highway department agrees to use toll revenues which exceed necessary maintenance costs for projects that are eligible for Federal-aid highway funds; and (2) such highway is publicly owned and operated. Provides that the Federal share payable for any authorized State toll project shall not exceed 75 percent. Sets limitations upon the State use of toll revenues which exceed necessary maintenance costs. Makes Federal-aid highway funds available for obligation on projects approaching any toll road, bridge, or tunnel. Authorizes Federal participation in analyses to determine State acquisition of a privately owned toll road, bridge, or tunnel. Repeals Federal prohibitions against toll highways under the Federal-aid highways program."
