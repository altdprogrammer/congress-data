Provides for expedited consideration of such joint resolution. Requires the divestiture of U.S. investments in the oil industry in South Africa to be effective six months after such 12-month period. Makes the prohibition on U.S. exports of oil to South Africa effective at the end of such 12-month period. Prohibits any Federal agency from issuing a lease or permit for the exploration, development, or production of coal, gas, or oil to anyone who violates the divestiture provision or the export prohibition of this Act. Provides for enforcement of this Act. Sets forth additional penalties for violations of this Act."
