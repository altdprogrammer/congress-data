Revises the eligibility requirements for such benefits. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and implement procedures which provide that whenever an individual is formally notified of his or her SSI eligibility, such individual will also be notified of the availability of assistance under title XIX (Medicaid) of such Act. Directs the Secretary, when any individual receives SSI benefits on the basis of a disability, to notify such individual of his or her potential eligibility for the SSI benefits available for those performing substantial gainful activity despite a severe medical impairment. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of the operation of the SSI section which provides benefits for individuals who perform substantial gainful activity despite a severe medical impairment, with the particular objective of evaluating the work incentive provisions of such section. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress the findings of such study. Title II: Disabled Workers Demonstration Program - Amends the Rehabilitation Act to direct the Secretary of Education to establish grant programs to: (1) assist employers to plan, implement, operate, expand, and evaluate retention and reemployment demonstration programs for disabled workers; (2) assist employers to develop plans for the initiation or substantial expansion of a comprehensive retention and reemployment program for disabled workers; (3) assist employers to implement or substantially expand a comprehensive retention and reemployment program for disabled workers; and (4) assist employers in evaluating the effectiveness of any retention and reemployment program for disabled workers. Requires any employer requesting a grant to apply to the Secretary in such form, and at such times, as the Secretary may request. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1992. Title III: Employment Opportunities Demonstration Program for SSI and Disability Insurance Recipients - Directs to Secretary to establish a grant program to assist the States in establishing and operating demonstration programs to promote, identify, secure, and evaluate employment opportunities for individuals receiving SSI on the basis of blindness or disability, and individuals receiving disability insurance benefits or child's insurance benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Requires any State requesting a grant to apply to the Secretary in such form, and at such times, as the Secretary may require. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1992."
