    "text": "Veterans' Disability Compensation and Survivor Benefits Amendments of 1985 - Title I: Disability Compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Rate Increases - Increases the rates of veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, and the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans. Increases the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and for children, as well as the rates of supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation for children. Title II: Other Veterans' Program Improvements - Eliminates as an effective date for the discontinuance or reduction of compensation those benefits which were based on the last date of school attendance of a payee or dependent of a payee. Revises provisions concerning the active-duty status of members of the National Guard or Air National Guard for purposes of entitlement to veterans' benefits. Further conditions the circumstances under which adopted children of veterans may be considered dependents for purposes of entitlement to veterans' benefits. Includes lung disabilities of 50 percent or more in the \"paired organ\" criteria which permits a presumption of service-connected disability for both organs when only one such organ was actually a service-connected disability. Title III: Extension of Authority to Operate A Regional Office in the Republic of the Philippines - Extends through FY 1988 the authority of the Administrator of the Veterans Administration to operate a regional office in the Republic of the Philippines."
