    "text": "Professional Football Stabilization Act of 1985 - Prohibits any professional football team which has played its home games in a metropolitan area for six years or more from relocating, unless: (1) a party to the stadium lease agreement fails to comply with such agreement and such noncompliance cannot be remedied within a reasonable time; (2) the stadium is inadequate for operating the team and the stadium authority shows no intention of correcting the inadequacies; or (3) the team has lost money for at least three consecutive years or for a shorter period to the extent that the continued financial viability of the team is threatened. Exempts from the applicability of certain antitrust laws any joint agreement by persons engaged in professional football which restricts the movement of any team in accordance with this Act. Authorizes any municipal government to bring a civil action for damages and equitable relief against a professional football team which relocates from that area in violation of this Act."
