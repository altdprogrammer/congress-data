Requires the Administrator to submit to the Congress any proposal to establish such a zone. Deems the establishment of such a zone or area to be a major Federal action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. Requires an environmental impact statement to accompany such a proposal. States that an airspace zone proposal shall only be effective upon enactment into law of a provision approving it. Makes this Act inapplicable in time of war or national emergency declared by the President or the Congress."
