Sets the pay and allowances to be provided to Council members. Directs the President to appoint an executive director of the Council upon the recommendation of the Council chairperson. Sets forth miscellaneous provisions regarding Council powers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 and 1988, but prohibits their use for museum construction.
