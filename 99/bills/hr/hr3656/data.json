Title II: The Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway Advisory Council - Establishes the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway Advisory Council to develop and implement an economic strategy to improve the capacity of the Great Lakes region to market and transport commodities in a timely manner and to maximize the efficiency and benefits of market products produced in the Great Lakes region and products shipped through the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway system. Prescribes guidelines for such strategy. Requires the Council to report to the President and the Congress regarding such strategy. Terminates the Council 180 days after the submission of such report.
