    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include in the gross income of a highly compensated employee who is a participant in a discriminatory fringe benefit plan an amount equal to such employee's employer provided benefit under such plan. Provides that a plan shall be considered discriminatory unless: (1) the plan benefits 100 percent of all employees of the employer in the case of an accident or health plan; or (2) the plan benefits 85 percent or more of the employees of the employer in the case of any other type of plan. Specifies that certain employees shall be excluded from consideration for purposes of calculating such percentages. Requires that any benefits of an employee benefit plan provided to any participant who is highly compensated must be made available on the same terms and conditions to all other participants. Defines a \"highly compensated employee\" as an employee who is among the employer's 15 percent most highly compensated employees, or who owns more than five percent of the employer."
