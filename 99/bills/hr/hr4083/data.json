Provides guidelines for the apportionment of funds withheld on or before September 30, 1988, to States that subsequently comply with the national minimum drinking age. Requires that funds withheld from a State which has failed to comply within a certain period of time lapse and be made available for certain other projects. Provides that non-Interstate funds withheld after September 30, 1988, shall be apportioned among the other States. Requires Interstate funds withheld after September 30, 1988, to be made available for certain other projects."
