(Currently, substitute transit projects are funded from the general fund of the Treasury.) Provides that 25 percent of such funds shall be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation, and the remaining 75 percent shall be apportioned on the basis of the Federal share of the cost to complete withdrawn interstate routes. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 to repeal authorizations for parkways and park highways out of the Highway Trust Fund for FY 1986."
