    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-07-11", 
    "text": "Tobacco Program Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set the 1985 support price for Burley tobacco at $1.449 per pound. Sets the price support level for any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured and Burley) for which marketing quotas are in effect or not disapproved by producers at the preceding year's price, plus or minus the amount by which the current crop's price is greater or less than the preceding year's price, as such difference may be adjusted by the Secretary of Agriculture. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce the support level if requested by a producer association. Sets the price support level for the 1986 and subsequent crops of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco at the preceding year's level, plus or minus an adjustment of 65 percent to 100 percent of the total of: (1) two-thirds of the amount by which 95 percent of the previous five years' average marketing price is greater or less than the preceding year's support price; and (2) one-third of the change in the index of prices paid by tobacco farmers during the previous calendar year. Repeals the provision authorizing the Secretary to reduce price supports for certain low quality grades of Flue-cured tobacco. Requires Flue-cured and Burley tobacco purchasers to pay to the appropriate associations assessments on all purchases of such tobacco marketed by a producer from a farm. States that such assessments shall be determined so that producers and purchasers share equally in maintaining association funds. Requires assessments to be collected from: (1) the person acquiring the tobacco; (2) the warehouseman or agent if the tobacco is marketed through such person; or (3) the producer on sales (by the producer) to a person outside the United States. Subjects persons who fail to collect and remit such assessment to a penalty. Provides for: (1) notice and hearing opportunity; and (2) U.S. district court review. Provides that for the 1986 and subsequent Burley crops assessment shall be determined without regard to any losses the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) may sustain with respect to the 1983 Burley crop. Directs the CCC to acquire and dispose of surplus Flue-cured and Burley tobacco inventories. States that such tobacco shall not be offered for sale for processing into manufactured tobacco products, or entered into either the domestic or foreign tobacco trade for such purpose."
