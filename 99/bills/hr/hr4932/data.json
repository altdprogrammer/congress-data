    "text": "Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984 (the Act) to exempt contractors from a requirement to fully reimburse the Federal Government under certain circumstances in the case of research and development agreements. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, following the completion of a contract under provisions for data continuity after the Landsat system, and upon 30 days' advance notice to the Congress, to dispose of any Government assets so as to ensure continuation of the contractor's commercial activity. Requires that there be consultation with the National Remote-Sensing Advisory Committee (established by this Act) with respect to the national research and development plan under the Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish a National Remote-Sensing Advisory Committee (the Committee). Sets forth Committee membership and functions. Revises provisions concerning the use of experimental data from Federal research and development programs. Requires Federal agencies to consult with the Committee in making determinations relating to such use. Adds provisions relating to the use of non-Federal data from the research and development activities of system operators. Authorizes system operators to require that unenhanced data not be reproduced or disseminated by a foreign or domestic purchaser."
