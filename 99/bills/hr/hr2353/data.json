Requires each community or technical college which is awarded such a grant to provide an associate degree training program in designated advanced-technology occupational fields. Sets the maximum grant award at $500,000 per year. Requires the Director, in order to assure that the program is consistent with the needs of industries, to appoint a 15-year National Advisory Council on Advanced Technician Training, which shall advise the Director on program goals and implementation, review program effectiveness, and report annually to the Director and the Congress.
