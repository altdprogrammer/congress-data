Requires the administering authority to make certain determinations regarding any: (1) subsidy provided such imported articles; and (2) substandard hourly wages paid to foreign workers who produce such imported articles. Requires such determinations to include an estimate of the hourly wage differential. Directs the administering authority to increase the amount of a countervailing duty imposed on such imported article by an amount sufficient to offset the hourly wage differential. Provides for the periodic administrative review of determinations made under this Act."
