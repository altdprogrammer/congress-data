Prescribes guidelines for the Request for Bids procedure and the financial restructuring of Conrail. Confers original and exclusive jurisdiction upon a special three-judge Federal district court over any suits regarding actions taken either by such Board or under this Act. Repeals certain Federal law regarding the sale of the Federal interest in Conrail common stock. Makes inapplicable to the sale of Conrail common stock provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requiring all Federal agencies to include an environmental impact statement in any proposed major Federal action."
