Requires a pretrial hearing to be held within 30 to 60 days after the filing of an action. Directs the hearing official to make recommendations regarding: (1) the relative strength of the legal position of each party; and (2) expediting discovery proceedings. Requires the court to take certain actions to expedite matters where discovery has not been completed within one year. Requires that future damages awards exceeding $100,000 be made by periodic payments. Requires that damages awards be offset by any amount received as compensation for the same injury from other sources. Limits the amount of damages for noneconomic losses to $100,000. Makes any attorney whose conduct is calculated for delay, or is found to be in bad faith, subject to pecuniary sanctions by the court. Title II: State Tort Liability Reform - Provides certain limitations and procedures regarding civil damages in claims arising under State law alleging negligence, strict or product liability, intentionally tortious conduct, or malpractice. Requires a pretrial hearing to be held within 30 to 60 days after the filing of an action.
