Transfers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission such functions relating to the transportation of oil by pipeline as were carried out by the Secretary of Energy or the ICC before enactment of such Act. Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to delete provisions requiring common carriers to establish just and reasonable rates, fares, and charges. Deletes provisions: (1) requiring the ICC to investigate forthwith the lawfulness of a rate, fare, or charge upon the filing of a petition by a concerned carrier; and (2) empowering the ICC to issue cease and desist orders regarding rates, fares, and charges. Repeals provisions requiring the ICC to establish just divisions of joint fares, rates, or charges. Prohibits any State or interstate agency from reviewing, prescribing, suspending, or regulating the rates or charges of any common carrier for transportation of oil by pipeline in interstate commerce."
