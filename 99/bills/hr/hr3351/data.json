Requires any station licensee which allows a person to broadcast material endorsing or opposing a candidate to provide to the candidate opposing the endorsed candidate, or to the candidate opposed by the material, the opportunity to use the same amount of broadcasting time, during the same period of the day. Authorizes the licensee to charge applicable rates for such opportunities. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to pay such charges."
