    "text": "Occupational Hazard Communication Act of 1986 - Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to conduct research into improving the means of: (1) surveillance of employees exposed to occupational health hazards; and (2) medical monitoring and treatment of employees exposed to occupational hazards. Requires that such research be conducted primarily through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Directs the Secretary, within six months after enactment of this Act, to amend the hazard communication standard contained in specified Federal regulations in the following ways. Makes such standard applicable, despite specified provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act), to all employers, including manufacturing, mining, construction, and transportation. Requires that employers provide notice and training to current employees concerning health hazards to which employees are exposed in work areas. Requires that employers transmit health hazard notices to former employees. Requires that employee hazard training emphasize the chronic and acute health effects of such hazards so as to promote early detection and treatment. Sets forth protections against employer discrimination against employees who have been notified that they are at risk of any occupational disease. Sets forth provisions for enforcement of hazard communication standards under the Act and under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977."
