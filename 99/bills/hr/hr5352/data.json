    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1986-08-07", 
    "text": "International Narcotics Control Act of 1986 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to promote the eventual elimination of narcotics production and trafficking in order that all countries meet their international obligations with respect to narcotics control efforts. Provides that failure of a country to cooperate in pursuing such goal would provide a basis for implementing a specified section of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 relating to suspension of U.S. aid. Title I: International Narcotics Control Assistance Program - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the FY 1987 authorization for aid for international narcotics control. Authorizes additional funds for FY 1987 for international narcotics control. Permits such additional funds to be appropriated only if the President has submitted to the Congress: (1) a budget request for such funds; and (2) a plan showing how such funds will be used. Requires that a specified amount of the FY 1987 authorization for military assistance shall be available only to provide aircraft to countries receiving FY 1987 assistance for narcotics control. Requires such aircraft to be used solely for narcotics control eradication and interdiction efforts. Earmarks at least half such aircraft for Latin America. Requires the use of such aircraft to be administered in accordance with the narcotics control program authorities. Requires such aircraft to be made available to foreign countries only on a lease or loan basis. Requires the Secretary of State to maintain detailed records on the use of such aircraft. Requires such records to be available to the Congress upon request. Earmarks a specified amount of the FY 1987 international military education and training funds for education and training in the operation and maintenance of aircraft used in narcotics control interdiction and eradication efforts. Requires such assistance to be coordinated with the narcotics control assistance. Earmarks a specified amount of the FY 1987 international narcotics control assistance for research on and development of safe and effective herbicides for use in the aerial eradication of coca. Requires the Comptroller General to investigate and report to the Congress on the effectiveness of the international narcotics control program. Title II: Improving Law Enforcement and Other Narcotics Control Activities Abroad - Requires the President's annual report to the Congress on the international strategy to prevent cultivation and trafficking in narcotics to include a discussion of the extent to which each source country has cooperated with U.S. narcotics control efforts through the extradition or prosecution of drug traffickers and a description of the status of negotiations with each such country to negotiate an updated extradition treaty. Commends the decision of the Secretary of State to issue diplomatic passports to officials and employees of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress before changing such policy. Exempts from the prohibition on participation by U.S. officers or employees in direct police narcotics arrests in a foreign country those U.S. employees in certain foreign countries designated by the Secretary of State. Prohibits U.S. officers or employees in such a country from directly effecting an arrest in that country as part of a foreign police action with respect to narcotics control. Permits the U.S. officer or employee in such a country to assist foreign officers who are effecting an arrest. Permits U.S. officers or employees in any country to take direct action to protect life or safety if exigent circumstances arise which are unanticipated and pose an immediate threat to U.S. officers or employees, officers or employees of a foreign government, or members of the public. Requires the executive branch to establish expeditiously the information sharing system that will list all drug arrests of foreign nationals in the United States as required by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987. Requires the executive branch to report to the Congress when that system has been established. Urges the President to require that greater priority be given to the collection and sharing of information concerning narcotics related activities abroad. Requires the President to direct that an updated threat assessment of narcotics trafficking from Africa be prepared. Requires the President to take concrete steps to improve the capability of the executive branch to: (1) collect information on the links between narcotics traffickers and acts of terrorism abroad; and (2) develop the means to respond to the threat which those links pose. Requires the President to report to the Congress on such steps. Requires a specified amount of the FY 1987 administration of justice program authorization to be used to provide to Colombia or other countries in the region such assistance as requested to protect judicial or other officials who are targets of narcoterrorist attacks. Urges the Secretary of State to increase efforts to negotiate with relevant countries procedures for the interdiction of vessels suspected of carrying illicit narcotics.
