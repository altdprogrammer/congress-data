Requires such Panel to report annually to the Congress. Directs the Joint Chairmen of the Acid Precipitation Task Force to establish a bilateral advisory and consultative group on transboundary pollution with appropriate officials of the Canadian Government. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991. Sets forth secondary areas of concern for research on acid precipitation, including monitoring the dry deposition of acidic particles and surface water acidification."
