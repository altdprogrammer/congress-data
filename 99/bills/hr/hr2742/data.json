    "text": "Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act of 1985 - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to provide, with respect to guaranteed, insured, and direct student loans, deferral of repayment, and payment by the Government of the interest, during the borrower's full-time service as a public or private elementary or secondary school teacher. Limits such period of deferral of repayment, and Government payment of the interest, to not more than five years. Amends title V (Teacher Corps and Teacher Training Programs) of HEA to insert a new part A, Professional Development Centers (currently, there is no part A). Directs the Secretary of Education, under such professional development centers program, to make grants to local educational agencies, institutions of higher eudcation, and consortia of such agencies and institutions to support programs for: (1) in-service training and professional development for existing teachers of elementary and secondary schools; (2) teacher preparation for new teachers; (3) educational leadership; and (4) special assistance to those teachers working with and in low-income areas and schools serving special populations. Directs the Secretary, in awarding such grants, to give special emphasis to awarding grants to school districts that are in low-income areas and that have a demonstrated shortage of certified and qualified teachers. Requires that each project which receives such a grant be administered by a governing board primarily composed of teachers from the area served. Directs the Secretary to: (1) collect and disseminate information on projects receiving such grants; (2) evaluate the benefits for project participants; and (3) disseminate the results of such evaluations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the professional development centers program for FY 1986 through 1990."
