    "text": "Coal Pipeline Act of 1985 - Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to grant rights-of-way over Federal lands to certain persons for coal pipeline purposes. Proscribes the granting of any right-of-way through Federal land which is part of a historic site of national, State, or local significance unless there is no reasonable alternative and reasonable planning is made to minimize the harm to such site. Prohibits any person or entity (including the United States) from claiming any right or interest in water within any State for a coal pipeline unless such claim takes places under the law of the affected State. Delegates to the States all power regarding water rights for a coal pipeline in spite of any otherwise impermissible burden which may thereby be imposed upon interstate commerce. States that this Act does not: (1) impair the validity of any State law (or interstate compact) regarding any claim to water rights; (2) alter the rights of any State to its apportioned share of water under past or future allocation or interstate compact; (3) affect any Indian water rights; or (4) preempt or otherwise affect any State or Federal law or interstate compact regarding water quality or disposal. Prohibits any State acting under authority of this Act from restricting the movement through such State of water acquired in another State and within a coal pipeline. Authorizes certain persons who have received a certification from the Secretary that it is in the national interest to operate or extend a coal pipeline to acquire rights-of-way through private lands by the power of eminent domain. States this Act shall not be construed to permit any person (including the United States) to acquire any water rights through the power of eminent domain. Prohibits the acquisition of any right-of-way through the power of eminent domain if such right-of-way is upon land which is part of a historic site of national, State, or local significance, unless there is no prudent alternative and reasonable planning is made to minimize harm to such site. Sets forth certification guidelines under which the Secretary shall determine whether construction, operation, or extension of a coal pipeline is in the national interest. Requires each pipeline carrier for which a certification has been issued to provide service on reasonable request. Prohibits such carriers from unreasonably discriminating or refusing to enter into contracts with coal shippers under similar conditions in a contemporaneous period. Requires the Secretary to publish notice of coal pipeline certifications in the Federal Register. States that this Act shall not be construed to modify or preempt the ratemaking authority of any State utility regulatory agency. Requires the Secretary to establish uniform Federal standards for coal pipeline safety. Establishes penalties for failure to comply with such safety standards."
