    "text": "Consumers and Dairy Producers Fairness Act of 1985 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set milk price support levels through FY 1989 at $11.00 per hundredweight except that such level shall be set at $11.50 per hundredweight through FY 1986. Repeals the provision providing for a July 1, 1985, 50-cent milk price adjustment. Provides for the following adjustments based on 12-month estimated price support purchases: (1) 25-cent reduction as of October 1, 1986; (2) 25-cent reduction as of October 1, 1987; and (3) 50-cent increases after October 1, 1987. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, for the period beginning October 1987 to report to the appropriate congressional committees if further adjustments are necessary. Directs the Secretary to make loans and purchases for the 1986 corn crop at: (1) $3 per bushel for domestic use; and (2) not more than 75 percent of such price for other corn. Establishes 1987 through 1989 corn prices at: (1) $2.75 per bushel for domestic use; and (2) 80 percent of such price for other corn. Authorizes the Secretary to limit price support availability to producers of more than 10,000 bushels. Bases 1986 through 1989 feed grain support levels on such corn prices."
