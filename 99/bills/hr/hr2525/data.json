Sets forth information which may not be included in any such consumer report, including the consumer's involvement with tenants organizations, any safety or sanitation complaints, any rent abatements, or unadjudicated landlord complaints. Requires a consumer reporting agency that records and retains any information regarding an adverse rental action to make a clear and accurate disclosure to the consumer involved. Sets forth information which a consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer when the agency furnishes a report to a person in connection with the consumer's rental of any property as a principal place of residence. Requires the user of a consumer report that results in an adverse rental action to inform the consumer of the name and address of the consumer reporting agency making the report."
