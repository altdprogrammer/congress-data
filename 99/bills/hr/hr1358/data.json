Requires the President's certification to include statements that South Africa: (1) allows full and equal participation of nonwhites in the political system; (2) provides the same educational opportunities to nonwhites as are available to whites; (3) has eliminated discrimination in employment on the basis of race or ethnic origin; and (4) has terminated the policy of relocating South African blacks in the bantustans or homelands. Authorizes the President to resume diplomatic relations with South Africa only if: (1) the President makes a certification to the Congress; and (2) within 60 days after the President submits such certification a joint resolution is enacted approving the certification. Sets forth expedited procedures for considering such joint resolutions."
