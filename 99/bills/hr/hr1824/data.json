    "text": "Department of Defense Cost Savings Act of 1985 - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of any military department from operating or allowing a commissary to operate on any military installation unless: (1) such installation is located outside a metropolitan area; and (2) not more than one retail store offering the same food supplies as those of the commissary is located within ten miles of the installation. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish and implement a competitive rate program applicable to the transportation of household goods to and from Alaska and Hawaii. Repeals Federal law which prohibits utilizing such a rate system. Requires, before the closure or realignment of any military bases occur, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned to file with the Armed Services Committees of the House and Senate a concise statement of findings together with a succinct justification for such base closure. Reduces from 60 days to 30 days the waiting period required after such reports are submitted before any specific closure action may be taken. Maintains the 60-day waiting period in areas with a higher-than-average unemployment rate or if such closure or realignment would increase unemployment in such area by one percent or more. Requires the Secretary of Defense, within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to establish and implement an aircraft fuel conservation program. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the same date concerning such program."
