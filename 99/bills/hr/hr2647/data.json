    "text": "Veterans' Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 1985 - Title I: Educational Assistance Program Improvements - Amends the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program to provide assistance to eligible veterans pursuing a farm cooperative apprenticeship or other on-job training program in the same manner as provided to those pursuing correspondence training. Tolls the ten-year delimiting period for the provision of educational assistance if an otherwise eligible veteran was prevented from completing the chosen program of education because of a physical or mental disability beyond the control of such veteran. Extends eligibility for educational assistance to certain graduates of a service academy who served on active duty within a specified period. Requires that educational and vocational counseling be required prior to the selection of a program in the case of a veteran rated by the Veterans Administration as being incompetent. Repeals a Federal provision requiring advance payment of a work-study allowance to a veteran-student. Extends eligibility for receiving educational assistance for a survivor or dependent whose education was delayed because of a delay in determining eligibility. Permits the Administrator to arrange for educational or vocational counseling for eligible survivors and dependents without provisional approval of an application or the provision of an educational plan by a parent or guardian. Revises provisions concerning payments of educational assistance allowances for eligible veterans training on a less-than-half-time basis. Permits the Administrator to approve a delay in reporting the enrollment of an eligible veteran or person in an independent study course. Revises provisions concerning the measurement of course-loads for veteran-students. Title II: Repeal of Educational Loan Program; Technical Amendments - Repeals the educational loan program. Title III: Savings Provisions - Authorizes the Administrator to continue to collect payments on outstanding loans and to make certain transfers from the Veterans' Administration Education Loan Fund established for deposit of such collections."
