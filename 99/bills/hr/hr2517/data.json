    "text": "Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute (RICO) to modify the definitional sections. Defines \"criminal syndicate\" as an enterprise of five or more persons, a significant purpose of which is to engage on a continuing basis in a pattern of criminal activity other than solely gambling-related activity. Makes it a Federal offense for any person to knowingly organize, own, control, finance, or otherwise participate in a supervisory capacity in a criminal syndicate. Revises the state of mind elements for the prohibited activities to require certain knowledge as an element of such offenses. Increases the penalties for criminal violations of RICO (except for the offense involving the investment of income derived through RICO violations). Provides for a fine of not more than $250,000 or imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both."
