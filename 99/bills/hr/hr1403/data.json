Provides that the following individuals shall be eligible for the program: (1) those entitled to benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII; and (2) those residents aged 65 and older who are either citizens or lawfully admitted aliens who have resided in the United States continuously during the five years preceding their application.
