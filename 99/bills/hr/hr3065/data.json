Rept. 99-255 (Part I)) Superfund Clean-up Technology Research and Demonstration Act - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct an alternative or innovative treatment technology research, evaluation, and demonstration program to develop permanent solutions for use in remedial actions for the release of hazardous substances. Directs the Administrator to conduct a technology transfer program, including a central reference library for such information. Prohibits the Administrator from disclosing trade secret or proprietary information. Authorizes the Administrator to contract out such research and to provide assistance or information as appropriate, including the use of National Priority Sites for research and demonstration purposes. Requires the Administrator to designate at least ten demonstration sites for alternative or innovative treatment technologies, requiring public participation and compliance with specified criteria. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress annually on the research and demonstration program, requiring congressional notice before expending funds on a single project in excess of specified levels. Directs the Administrator to revise and republish the National Contingency Plan to include standards and testing procedures for using the alternative or innovative treatment technologies developed under this Act. Requires the Administrator to assess the long-term effectiveness of a solution and its capacity to permanently and significantly decrease the hazards presented by a substance when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a remedial action. Funds such research program out of Superfund, up to specified levels. Exempts persons conducting field demonstrations from liability for anything but releases caused by negligence. Directs the Administrator to transmit within one year a study to the Congress on the standards of liability and financial responsibility under CERCLA and the costs and incentives for developing the new technologies. Directs the Administrator to encourage small business participation in the research and demonstration activities of this Act."
