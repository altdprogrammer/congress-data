Exempts from such penalty certain lawful gambling operations. Declares such gambling operations lawful if they are conducted under tribal laws which have met the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and if they do not violate State laws. Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary shall approve tribal law regarding gambling operations. Describes circumstances in which a State is prohibited from declaring Indian gambling operations as being against public policy."
