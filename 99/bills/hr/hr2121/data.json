    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Coastal Zone Management Reauthorization Act of 1985 - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to reduce financial assistance extended to a coastal State in certain circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any coastal State for administering such State's coastal zone management program if the State provides 20 percent of the grant for FY 1986 with a ten percent increase annually to 50 percent annually for each fiscal year after FY 1988. (Currently, a State must pay 20 percent annually.) Revises provisions concerning program modification procedures. Establishes the National Estuarine Reserve Research System (the System). Authorizes the Secretary to designate an estuarine area as a national estuarine reserve upon certain findings. Requires the Secretary to develop guidelines for research within the System. Requires the Secretary to promote and coordinate the utilization of such reserves. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to coastal States for acquisition or operation of such reserves or to a coastal State or other entity to support research and monitoring within a reserve. Sets per-reserve grant limits. Directs the Secretary to periodically evaluate the operation and management of each reserve and its research. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend a reserve from eligibility for financial assistance or withdraw its designation as a national reserve upon certain findings. Requires an annual report, beginning with FY 1986, by the Secretary to the Congress concerning such reserves. Repeals Federal provisions which establish: (1) research and technical assistance grants for coastal zone management; and (2) the Coastal Zone Management Advisory Committee and certain other positions. Adjusts and extends through FY 1990 the authorization of appropriations for administrative grants to States for coastal resources management programs and for the establishment of national estuarine sanctuaries."
