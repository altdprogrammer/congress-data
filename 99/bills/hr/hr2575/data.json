Requires such persons to place all their stock in a trust for the remainder of such period, under trust terms that insure they do not exercise any control over the voting of such stock. Directs the Department of Transportation to determine whether all controlling stockholders of major United States international airlines are willing and able to continue the transportation authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity. Requires the Department to render a final decision on the matter within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act. Confers jurisdiction upon Federal district courts to enforce compliance with this Act."
