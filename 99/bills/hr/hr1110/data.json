Directs that all contributions by non-party multicandidate political committees to congressional candidates be deposited in the Treasury general fund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer specified amounts to the Trust Fund. Appropriates to the Fund for each fiscal year amounts equal to the total deposited in it during each fiscal year. States that upon certification from the Federal Election Commission the Secretary shall pay such contributions to the appropriate candidate. Prohibits the Secretary, when making payments, from: (1) identifying any committee; or (2) disclosing specific amounts contributed by particular committees. Directs the Commission to make public at specified times: (1) the identity of each committee making contributions and of each candidate receiving contributions; and (2) the total amounts contributed by each committee and received by each candidate. Prohibits the Commission or any other party from either making public or disclosing to candidates the specific amounts contributed to such candidates. Sets guidelines for periodic payments of such contributions."
