    "text": "Good Samaritan Assistance Act of 1985 - Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to authorize the Attorney General to make annual grants from the Crime Victims Fund to eligible good samaritan reward programs. Sets forth a formula to determine the amount of the grant. Makes a program eligible to receive grants if such program: (1) is operated by a State and offers rewards to good samaritans and their survivors; (2) certifies that grants will not be used to supplant State funds otherwise available to provide such award; (3) meets certain requirements imposed with respect to compensation to victims of crimes; and (4) is not an entitlement program. Defines \"good samaritan\" for purposes of this Act as an individual who acted voluntarily and nonnegligently to prevent a crime, apprehend a suspected offender, preserve the public peace, or prevent a public disturbance."
