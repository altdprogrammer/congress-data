    "text": "Restitution Amendments Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal criminal code to eliminate the power of the court to order restitution in lieu of other sentences when a defendant is convicted of a criminal offense. Modifies the standard for imposing restitution to provide that if the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may decline to make such an order. Requires the court to include a statement of reasons for imposing only partial restitution on a defendant. Eliminates the presentencing requirement that the court give notice to the defendant and the government that it is considering imposing an order of restitution. Requires the court to consider the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense as a factor when determining the particular sentence to be imposed."
