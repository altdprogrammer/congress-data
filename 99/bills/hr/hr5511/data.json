Provides that $100 notes of current design shall not be legal tender after such period. Authorizes the Secretary to allow the exchange of such notes for legal notes of equal value after such period and to require the person making such exchange to show evidence of the manner in which such person came to possess such notes and the reason for failing to exchange such notes before the 30-day period expired. Requires the Secretary to provide public notice of the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to adopt and issue as legal tender newly designed $100 notes."
