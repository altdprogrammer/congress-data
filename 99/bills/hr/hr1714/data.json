    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 99-379) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 1986 - Title I: NASA Authorization - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for specified activities relating to: (1) research and development; (2) space flight, control and data communications; (3) construction of facilities; and (4) research and program management. Permits appropriations for research and development and for space flight, control and data communications to be used: (1) for any items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) which may be required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts; and (2) for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Requires the Administrator of NASA (the Administrator) to notify specified congressional officers and committees whenever the cost of a facility exceeds a specified amount. Permits funds appropriated for research and development, for space flight, control and data communications, or for construction of facilities to remain available without fiscal year limitation. Permits appropriations for research and program management to be used for scientific consultations or extraordinary expenses upon the approval of the Administrator. Limits to not more than $100,000 per project (including collateral equipment) the amount that may be used for construction of new facilities and additions to existing facilities, and for repair, rehabilitation, or modification of facilities, from funds appropriated for research and development, for space flight, control and data communications, and for research and program management. Limits to not more than $500,000 per project (including collateral equipment) the amount that may be used for any of the foregoing for unforeseen programmatic needs, from funds appropriated for research and development and for space flight, control and data communications. Permits the funds for construction of any of specified facilities: (1) in the discretion of the Administrator, to be varied upward ten percent; or (2) following a report by the Administrator to specified congressional committees, to be varied upward 25 percent to meet unusual cost variations. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development or for space flight, control and data communications to be transferred to the appropriation for construction of facilities. Authorizes the expenditure of such transferred funds, together with a specified amount of the funds appropriated for construction of facilities, to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations. Requires the Administrator, 30 days before expending such funds, to notify specified congressional officers and committees of the nature, cost, and necessity of such construction. Prohibits any civil space station authorized under specified provisions of this Act from being used to: (1) carry or place in orbit any nuclear weapon or any other weapon of mass destruction; (2) install any such weapon on any celestial body; or (3) station any such weapon in space in any other manner. Allows such civil space station to be used only for peaceful purposes. Prohibits, until 30 days pass after congressional receipt of a full explanation by the Administrator, the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for any program: (1) deleted by the Congress; (2) in excess of the amount actually authorized for the particular program under provisions for research and development, space flight, control and data communications, and research and program management; or (3) which has not been presented to either of the specified congressional committees. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that it is in the national interest that consideration be given to geographical distribution of Federal research funds whenever feasible, and that NASA should explore ways of doing so. Authorizes the Inspector General of NASA to administer to or take from any person an oath, affirmation, or affidavit whenever necessary in performing functions assigned by the Inspector General Act of 1978, and to designate investigators or other employees to do so. Provides that the authorization for the space shuttle includes provision for: (1) production of a fleet of four space shuttle oribters, including structural and component spares; and (2) production readiness for a fifth orbiter vehicle. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1985 to extend by six months the deadline for submission, to the President and specified committees by the National Commission on Space, of a long-range plan for U.S. civilian space activity. Directs the Administrator, within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, to: (1) review recommendations of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control and recommendations included in a specified report of the Office of Management and Budget; and (2) submit a report to specified congressional officers and committees on the implementation status of each such recommendation which affects NASA and is within the Administrator's authority and control. Directs the Administrator to initiate an immediate feasibility study to ensure flight opportunities for a diverse segment of the American public, including a physically disabled American. Directs the Administrator to examine and report to the Congress on the feasibility of providing space shuttle launch services on the basis of royalty recovery over the economic life of commercial products produced or processed in space. Directs the Administrator to conduct a study and report to the Congress on a proposed pricing policy for certain services such as on-orbit service, repair, or recovery of spacecraft. Directs NASA, during FY 1986, to defer payment to the Federal Financing Bank of the amount attributable to principal for which NASA is obligated during such fiscal year as a result of a specified contract regarding track and data relay satellite services (which was entered into under specified provisions of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1978). Requires the amount of any such deferred payment to be added to the amount of principal for which NASA is obligated during FY 1993 as a result of such contract. Authorizes NASA to defer until FY 1994 any portion of the total amount for which it is obligated for FY 1993 which is in excess of the total amount for which it was obligated during FY 1992. Authorizes the Administrator to renegotiate such contract upon determination that such renegotiation is necessary to enable NASA to defer payments as provided under this Act. Directs the President to submit to the Congress at the earliest practicable date, but not later than May 1, 1986, a report on any action taken with respect to the establishment in 1992 of an International Space Year. Requires such report to include descriptions of possible international missions and related research and educational activities. Title II: Shuttle Pricing Policy for Commercial and Foreign Users - Directs the Administrator to establish and implement a pricing system to recover reimbursement from each commercial or foreign user of the Space Transportation System (STS) in accordance with a pricing policy which is consistent with specified findings, which encourages the full and effective use of space, and which is designed to achieve the following policy goals: (1) preservation of the U.S. role as a leader in space research, technology, and development; (2) efficient and cost-effective use of STS; (3) greatly increased commercial space activities; and (4) enhancement of the international competitive position of the United States. Requires, with specified exceptions, that such pricing system include a base price of at least $74,000,000 (in 1982 dollars) for each STS flight. Directs the Administrator to submit to specified congressional officers and committees an annual report (transmitted at the same as the President's annual budget request) on how the policy goals specified under this title are being furthered by the shuttle price of foreign and commercial users. Authorizes the Administrator, upon a finding that such policy goals are not being achieved, to reduce the base price established under this title. Requires the Administrator to notify specified congressional officers and committees, with a description of the proposed reduction and a complete statement of the facts and circumstances which make it necessary. Requires a 45-day waiting period after congressional receipt of such notice before such reduction becomes effective. Prohibits the minimum price established by such a reduction from being less than the additive cost. Defines \"additive cost\". Authorizes the Administrator to set a price lower than the base price or the reduced price, or to provide no-cost flights, for any commercial or foreign user of STS who is involved in research, development, or demonstration programs with NASA. Authorizes the Administrator to offer reasonable customer incentives consistent with the policy goals specified under this title. Makes this title applicable with respect to STS flights beginning on or after October 1, 1988. Title III: Office of Commercial Space Transportation - Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 to the Secretary of Transportation to carry out such Act (which provides for licensing and liability insurance requirements for commercial space launches)."
