Requires maps and legal descriptions of such areas to be made available to the public. Directs the Secretary to manage the withdrawn lands for grazing, wildlife habitat, control of predatory animals, and the preservation and suppression of brush and range fires resulting from nonmilitary activities. Makes such uses secondary to the military uses. Permits the Secretary to issue leases, easements, rights-of-way, or other authorizations only with the concurrence of the Secretary of the military department concerned. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to close withdrawn lands to the public to the degree required by public safety or national security. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a management plan for each area within three years of this Act's enactment. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to prevent and control fires which result from military activities. Authorizes such Secretary to request assistance from the Bureau of Land Management on a reimbursable basis. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the military department concerned to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement the land management plan for each group of withdrawn lands. States that the withdrawal of Nellis and Luke Air Force Ranges does not affect the status of the Desert National Wildlife Range, Nevada, or the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. Terminates these public land withdrawals after 15 years. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to publish a draft environmental impact statement at least three years before such termination if the military department has a continuing need for the withdrawn lands.

Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to notify the Secretary of the intent to relinquish such lands before the termination of their withdrawal. Requires the Secretary of Defense, acting through such departments, to submit with the notice to relinquish a determination of the extent of such lands' contamination. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept withdrawn lands for relinquishment if such lands are contaminated with explosives or hazardous materials and the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the otherwise mandatory decontamination is not feasible. Requires such Secretary to reevaluate the feasibility of decontaminating unacceptable lands. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to make public any order to accept back jurisdiction of previously withdrawn lands. Requires the Secretary to review withdrawn lands immediately and every five years thereafter to determine which lands can be opened under specified mining and resource laws.

Empowers the Secretary to close withdrawn lands which have been opened for mining if necessary for national emergency or national security purposes. Sets forth the status of mining claims on withdrawn lands. Redesignates the Luke Air Force Range, Arizona, as the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range.
