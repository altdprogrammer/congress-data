    "text": "Court-Annexed Arbitration Act of 1986 - Amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to empower (on an experimental basis) specified U.S. district courts to authorize the use of arbitration. Permits such courts to: (1) allow arbitration where the parties consent; and (2) require arbitration under certain limited circumstances. Disallows referrals to arbitration where: (1) the action is based on an alleged violation of a right secured by the Constitution; (2) the action is brought against an official of the United States for an act performed within the outer perimeters of his or her official duties; and (3) the action is brought by the United States to recover money or property from an employee or former employee, or is based on fraud. Provides that the arbitration award shall be filed with the clerk of the district court and (after 30 days) entered as the judgment of the court. States that such judgment shall not: (1) be subject to review in any other court of appeal; or (2) preclude any issues from being raised in any action seeking redress from a violation of any rights. Allows any party, within 30 days after the filing of an arbitration award, to demand a trial de novo in the district court. Requires the specified district courts to establish standards for the certification of arbitrators and to certify arbitrators. Requires the Federal Judicial Center to report to the Congress on the implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
