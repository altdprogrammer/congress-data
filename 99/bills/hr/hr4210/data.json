    "text": "Title I: Amendments to the General Provisions - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) to redefine \"severely handicapped individual\" and to add a definition of \"supported employment\" (competitive work in integrated work settings for individuals with severe handicaps who need intensive, on-going, post-employment support services to perform such work). Revises provisions of the Act to include references to supported employment. Provides that rehabilitation goals for severely handicapped individuals under the Act may include supported, homebound, or part-time employment. Requires the annual report to include an evaluation of the status of individuals with severe handicaps participating in programs under the Act. Title II: Amendments Related to Vocational Rehabilitation Services - Requires State plans under the Act to contain the plans, policies, and methods to be followed to assist in the transition from education to employment related activities. Requires the State agency to provide a justification for the order to be followed in selecting individuals to whom vocational rehabilitation services will be provided. Includes community mental health programs among the entities with whom State vocational rehabilitation agencies may enter into cooperative agreements. Requires that the goals of the individualized written rehabilitation program be based on an assessment determined through an evaluation of rehabilitation potential. Includes under the scope of vocational rehabilitation services for individuals under the Act an evaluation by personnel skilled in rehabilitation technology. Title III: Amendments Related to Research and Training - Includes dissemination of the results of their research under the functions of Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers. Redesignates the National Institute of Handicapped Research as the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation. Title IV: Amendments Related to Services for Independent Living - Includes developmentally disabled individuals as eligible for services for independent living. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Provides that the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board may not both be members of the general public or Federal officials."
