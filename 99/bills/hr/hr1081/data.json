States that it shall be the objective of each program to help achieve self-sufficiency for individuals under the age of 25 who are eligible for AFDC, who are pregnant, or who are mothers with children under the age of six, and who voluntarily elect to participate in the program by: (1) requiring such individuals to seek a high school diploma or take part in appropriate training; (2) providing each participant with academic or vocational training and job placement; (3) coordinating services available to participants; and (4) providing each participant with other services and assistance designed to meet such objective. Requires a program to meet certain requirements, including the provision of child care services, necessary transportation, and an outreach program designed to attract individuals who would be eligible for the program. Limits the size of a grant for such program to: (1) in FY 1985 and 1986, two percent of the State's AFDC Federal payment; (2) in FY 1987, three percent of such payment; and (3) in FY 1988 or any subsequent fiscal year, four percent of such payment. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the States, to establish a systematic reporting system capable of yielding comprehensive data on which service figures and program evaluations shall be based. Directs the Secretary to annually report to the Congress, and the States to annually report to the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations."
