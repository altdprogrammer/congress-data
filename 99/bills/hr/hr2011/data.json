Requires an institution, on request, to provide an individual a summary description of such account offered by such institution. Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to pay interest to depository institutions on all reserves required for such accounts. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's compliance with this Act when examining such institution. Provides for the administrative enforcement of the requirements of this Act by the appropriate Federal banking agencies."
