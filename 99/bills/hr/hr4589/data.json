Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution (the Director), to establish procedures to identify for such grants each fiscal year between ten and 20 such centers which are administered by LEAs or individual schools and which have exemplary programs designed to develop civic competence and responsibilities. Directs the Secretary to ensure geographical balance in such selection and that at least one-third of the selected LEAs or schools serve high concentrations of low-income, minority, or limited English language proficiency students. Provides that such grants shall be between $25,000 and $75,000. Requires grant recipients to provide specified assurances. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Director, to convene in each fiscal year a conference of representatives of grant recipients and other experts in civic education.
