    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that if any firearm required to be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record is not so registered then provisions relating to judicial action to enforce forfeiture and the treatment of seized personal property valued at $2,500 or less shall not apply to any such firearm. Provides that if such a firearm is seized by the United States then: (1) no property rights shall exist in such firearm; and (2) such firearm shall be summarily forfeited to the United States. Allows reimbursement to the owner of forfeited firearms in certain specified circumstances. Revises provisions concerning the registration of firearms dealers, importers, and manufacturers to provide for registration in each State where such business is to be carried on rather than in each internal revenue district. Revises rules relating to the filing of returns of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms taxes."
