    "text": "Amends Federal law to authorize certain principal works for the Auburn-Folsom South unit of the American River Division, Central Valley irrigation project, California. Directs that certain expenditures, as determined by the Secretary of the Army, shall be nonreimbursable. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) maintain minimum water flows in the American River (downstream from Nimbus Dam) for fish, recreation, and wildlife; and (2) release water from the Nimbus Dam under certain circumstances so long as this diversion will not decrease the flow of the Lower American River. Requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and National Park Services to establish a monitoring program. Requires that the costs for maintaining minimum flows in the American River shall be nonreimbursable, provided that the costs of constructing and operating the Hood-Clay Pump Connection and Clay Station Reservoir shall be reimbursable. Authorizes appropriations for the Auburn-Folsom South unit in terms of July 1982 prices, starting with FY 1985. (Current law authorizes appropriations of a lesser sum in terms of 1965 prices.) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1970 to provide for the relocation of the southern terminus of the existing Placer County Road from Auburn to Foresthill, California. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cost sharing agreements with non-Federal entities to provide assistance in financing the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Auburn-Folsom South unit."
