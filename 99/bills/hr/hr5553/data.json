Requires such nonprofit organization to demonstrate that it will undertake activities to become financially independent at the close of FY 1991. Directs the Institute to: (1) compile information and translate research and technical information about government and private sector initiatives relating to services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; and (2) establish a national toll-free telephone line for information dissemination, but set an appropriate fee for other information dissemination.
