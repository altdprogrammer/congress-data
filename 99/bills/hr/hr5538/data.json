Exempts from such withholding measures charter buses of ten or more passengers whose drivers are not permitted by State law to possess open alcoholic beverages in the passenger area. Sets forth guidelines for the withholding of such funds. Provides for the release of withheld funds to States which comply with this Act on or before September 30, 1991."
