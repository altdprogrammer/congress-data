Enables survivors of such an individual to accept the award where the person dies before it is made. Directs the Attorney General to take into account: (1) the value of the sums and objects forfeited to the United States as the result of such person's conduct; and (2) whether arrests are made. Requires the Attorney General to consult with other Federal agencies with respect to the making of such awards."
