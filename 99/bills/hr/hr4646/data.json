Requires that all occupants be protected by passive restraint systems in automobiles manufactured after September 1, 1999. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a legislative proposal to the Congress designed to make the amount of the excise tax imposed on any vehicle commensurate with the average charge for qualified passive restraint systems as optional equipment. Directs the Secretary to return the revenues raised by such excise tax on a pro rata basis to purchasers of passenger automobiles with qualified restraint systems."
