Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission to: (1) consider the effects that pooling agreements between a motor common carrier of household goods and its agents may have upon the agent firms and all forms associated with such agent firms by common ownership; and (2) preserve the operational flexibility and competitive potentials of such agents and firms under common ownership with them."
