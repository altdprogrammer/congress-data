    "text": "Wheat Export Enhancement Act of 1985 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, effective for the 1986 through 1989 wheat crops, to set loan and purchase levels at not less than $3.30 per bushel nor more than 90 percent of parity. Makes such loans for a nine-month term, with no interest charged for the first three months. Provides for acreage bases determined on the previous seven years' annual average planted acreage. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue export marketing certificates, based on wheat acreage bases, to participating farmers for overseas wheat sales. Authorizes the Secretary to issue additional certificates as necessary. Permits certificate conveyance. Prohibits export wheat or wheat products sales without such certificates. Exempts Government wheat stocks from such prohibition. Subjects persons who counterfeit such certificates, or make sales without them, to criminal penalties. Directs the Secretary to make export differential payments available on a quarterly basis. Authorizes the Secretary to announce a wheat acreage limitation if he determines that wheat stocks will be otherwise excessive, taking into account the need for an adequate national emergency carryover. Requires the Secretary to announce a wheat acreage limitation if estimated wheat stocks exceed four percent of estimated world consumption in any marketing year. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for a two-year reduction with respect to the 1986 and 1987 crops. Suspends specified marketing quota and certificate provisions. Authorizes expenditures for agricultural export subsidies when necessary to compete in foreign-subsidized markets."
