    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Interjurisdictional Fisheries Research Act of 1985 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to apportion funds for interjurisdictional fisheries research projects among the States in a ratio based on fishery resources volume and value as determined by the Secretary. Assures a guaranteed apportionment to those States which: (1) are a signatory to an interstate fishery compact; or (2) border on one or more of the Great Lakes. Allows States to submit proposals for projects to be evaluated by the Secretary before determining the funds to be obligated to such States. Prohibits the Federal share of the cost of any project from exceeding 75 percent, unless the State has adopted the interstate fishery management plan for the resource involved, or the fishery regulations consistent with the Federal fishery management plan for the species involved, in which case the Federal share shall not exceed 90 percent. Requires prompt notification to States by the Secretary of project approval or disapproval. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations to assure that the performance of all project work is in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws. Vests title to all project property in the State. Requires the Secretary, beginning not later than 90 days after FY 1987 and biennially thereafter, to submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees concerning project assessments and expenditures of funds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 for the use of specified interstate commissions to develop interstate fishery management plans for interjurisdictional fishery resources. Repeals the Commercial Fisheries Research and Development Act of 1964."
