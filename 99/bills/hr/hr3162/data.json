    "text": "Fair Trade for Agriculture Act - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to direct the President to determine, within 90 days of enactment, the foreign countries that impose nontariff trade barriers on imports of U.S. agricultural goods. Directs the President to publish a list of such countries within 120 days of enactment. Authorizes the President to revise such list. Authorizes any interested person to file with the United States Trade Representative (USTR) a petition alleging that a foreign country is imposing nontariff trade barriers on imports of U.S. agricultural goods that restrict U.S. commerce or impair the growth of markets in that country for such goods. Directs the USTR to determine whether the allegations are true and to inform the President of any such determination. Sets forth time limits on the actions by the USTR. Directs the President, within 60 days after it is determined that a country is imposing such trade barriers, to impose trade restrictions on U.S. imports of that country's products that will have an economic effect equivalent to the effect of such trade barriers, notwithstanding any trade agreement between the United States and that country. Requires the trade restrictions to remain in effect until the President, acting through the USTR, determines that the foreign country has removed the nontariff trade barriers. Sets forth the responsibilities of the USTR with respect to petitions for the imposition of reciprocal trade restrictions. Requires the President to publish in the Federal Register and report to the Congress: (1) the results of all determinations of the existence of foreign nontariff trade barriers; and (2) all actions taken to impose reciprocal trade restrictions. Provides for judicial review of determinations by the USTR with respect to the existence of nontariff trade barriers."
