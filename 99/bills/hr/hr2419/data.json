Restricts support for military or paramilitary operations of the resistance in Nicaragua to amounts listed in a classified schedule. Authorizes the National Security Agency to secure the design and construction of a research and engineering facility at its headquarters at Ft. Meade, Maryland. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1986. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 233 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Provides that the Intelligence Community Staff shall be administered in the same manner as the Central Intelligence Agency. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title IV: Provisions Relating to Intelligence Agencies - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to provide that appropriated funds available to U.S. intelligence agencies may be made available only if: (1) Congress specifically authorized such funds for such activities; (2) the Director of Central Intelligence has notified appropriate congressional committees of the intent to make funds from the Reserve for Contingencies of the Central Intelligence Agency available for such activity; or (3) appropriate congressional committees are notified of the need to reprogram funds for higher priority activities due to unforeseen requirements. Provides that no funds may be made available for any intelligence activity for which funds were denied by the Congress. Requires the President to submit a report to specified congressional committees on the capabilities, programs, and policies of the United States to protect against, detect, monitor, counter, and limit intelligence activities of foreign powers directed at U.S. Government activities or information. Requires that transfers by an intelligence agency of any items of military equipment or services during FY 1986 worth more than $1,000,000 be reported to specified congressional committees. Title V: General Provisions - States that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Allows increases in employee benefits as authorized by law. Title VI: Facilitating Naturalization of Certain Foreign Intelligence Sources - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for the waiver of certain requirements and the naturalization of eligible petitioners who have made extraordinary contributions to the national security of the United States or to the conduct of U.S. intelligence activities. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to notify specified congressional committees every time the waiver provisions of this title will be applied. Title VII: Administrative Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use the proceeds from counterintelligence operations to offset the expenses incurred by such operations. Provides for the acceleration of retirement benefits for certain Central Intelligence employees working in unhealthful posts. Title VIII: Access to Criminal History Records for National Security Purposes - Requires criminal justice agencies, upon written consent from the individual under investigation, to provide criminal history record information to the Department of Defense, the Office of Personnel Management, or the Central Intelligence Agency for the purpose of determining eligibility for: (1) access to classified information; or (2) assignment to or retention in sensitive national security duties."
