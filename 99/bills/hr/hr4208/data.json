    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1986 - Authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for FY 1987 for: (1) operation and maintenance, and increases in salary, pay, and other employee benefits; (2) acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement for aids to navigation, shore facilities, vessels, and aircraft; (3) research, development, test, and evaluation; and (4) retirement pay and benefits. Authorizes the end strength for active-duty personnel of the Coast Guard for FY 1987. Specifies the authorized average military training student load for the Coast Guard for FY 1987. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (the Secretary) to transfer up to five percent of the appropriations among categories. Requires the Secretary to give the chairmen of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation 15 days' notice of any proposed transfer. Directs the Secretary to identify those activities that are necessary to maintain the logistics capability of the Coast Guard. Requires the Secretary, no later than January 31, 1987, to provide a list of such activities to the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees. Specifies certain activities to be excluded from such list. Provides that such activities may not be contracted for performance by non-government personnel, except in specified circumstances. Requires the Secretary, before the beginning of FY 1987, to submit to the above committees a list of activities that are to be contracted for performance by non-government personnel during that fiscal year. Requires each contract awarded by the Coast Guard in fiscal year 1986 or 1987 for construction or services to be performed in a State having an unemployment rate in excess of the national average unemployment rate to include a provision requiring the contractor to employ local residents to fulfill the work requirements of such contract. Assigns the performance of the Maritime Defense Zone command responsibilities to the Coast Guard. Raises the limitations on transfer to the Boat Safety Account within the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. Requires that amounts paid into the Boat Safety Account be determined in accordance with a specified Department of the Treasury report on gasoline excise tax revenues attributable to fuel used in recreational motorboats. Revises formulas for the allocation of the Boat Safety Account monies. Makes available to the Coast Guard between one and two percent of the funds which would be allocated to the States to pay the costs incurred by the Federal Government in administering the Boat Safety Account. Revises provisions concerning the Coast Guard Auxiliary to authorize the Secretary to pay interest on a claim of the Auxiliary in certain instances. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress within one year after enactment of this Act on the use of the Coast Gaurd Auxiliary. Provides sanctions against violators of orders of the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the anchorage and movement of any vessel in the navigable waters of the United States. Authorizes certain travel and expenses reimbursement for administrative personnel of the Secretary when such personnel are required to travel for purposes of administering certificates, licenses, or other documents to merchant seamen. Revises Federal provisions relating to the inspection of vessels to require the vessel's certificate of inspection to indicate the complement of licensed individuals and crew considered by the Secretary to be necessary for safe operation. Requires special manning requirements to be imposed upon: (1) sailing school vessels; and (2) self-elevating mobile offshore drilling units. Revises provisions concerning the towing of vessels to require the operators of such vessels to have a license to operate a towing vessel. Provides that, whenever a vessel is forfeited to the United States, such vessel may be donated to an educational institution with a commercial fishing vessel safety program that includes specified courses in fishing vessel safety. Outlines terms and conditions under which the donation of a vessel to an educational institution will be made. Releases the United States of any liability for actions arising from the use of such donated vessels. Prohibits any Coast Guard training or instruction to employees of the government or members of the armed services of the Republic of South Africa during FY 1987. Directs the Secretary to provide detailed reports to the Congress concerning the status of design and construction plans for the procurement of at least two new polar icebreaking vessels. Requires such report to be submitted annually until at least two new such vessels have been delivered to the Coast Guard. Requires each uninspected fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel operating on the high seas to be equipped with the number and type of emergency position-indicating radio beacons prescribed by regulation. Retitles specified Federal law as the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act. Makes it unlawful for any person on board a vessel of the United States, or on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance. Redefines terms under such Act. Grants waivers from restrictions on vessel documentation for five specified vessels."
