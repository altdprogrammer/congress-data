    "text": "Mining Extension Service Act of 1985 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) establish and carry out a national mining extension service pilot program to be administered by the Director of the Bureau of Mines; and (2) issue grants for the establishment and operation for a period of five years of two national mining extension service pilot projects, one to be located in a coal mining region and one to be located in a region where other minerals are mined. Requires each project to be established at or in connection with a State or a university with experience in operating an extension service (which need not be a mining extension service). States that the purposes of the national mining extension service pilot program shall be to: (1) facilitate information transfer regarding new technology in mining productivity or mining safety; (2) assess local mining community needs regarding increased productivity and decreased mining injuries; (3) prepare and distribute mining information reports and bulletins; (4) cooperate with and assist associations, agencies, and special committees having an interest in mining and miner training; and (5) promote, organize, and conduct seminars and workshops with respect to mining health, safety, and productivity. Requires each pilot project to have four full-time field agents and no more than five full-time administrative and support staff."
