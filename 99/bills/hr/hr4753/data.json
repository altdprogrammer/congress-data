Provides that before such impairment may constitute the basis for a finding of disability it must: (1) be medically determinable; (2) have limited one's ability to work; and (3) be expected to result in death or last for no less than 12 months. Frees the Secretary of Health and Human Services from conducting further inquiry where these indicia of severity are not satisfied."
