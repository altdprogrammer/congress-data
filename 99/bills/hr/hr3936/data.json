Provides that any individual convicted of such an offense shall not be eligible for parole until the minimum sentence has been served. Establishes criminal penalties for the manufacture, distribution, or possession of an unregulated drug which has a chemical structure or effect which is substantially similar to that of a controlled substance. Directs the Attorney General to study and recommend methods to control the diversion of legitimate precursor and essential chemicals to the production of illegal drugs. Requires the Attorney General to report all findings to the Congress."
