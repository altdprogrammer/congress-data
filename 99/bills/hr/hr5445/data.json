Revises the civil action requirements for persons aggrieved by RICO violations. Permits governments as well as persons to bring such an action. Provides for the recovery of treble damages: (1) where a government entity has been injured as a result of such violations; or (2) in the case of any person, if a criminal conviction of the defendant is obtained. Allows a person aggrieved by a RICO violation to recover punitive damages under certain circumstances. Requires the court to award a prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorney's fee. Sets a statute of limitations for such actions of: (1) three years after the cause of action accrues; (2) three years after the conduct causing injury terminates; or (3) two years after the date of the criminal conviction (required for a treble damage cause of action)."
