    "text": "Title I: Wheat and Feed Grains - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, effective for the 1986 through 1990 wheat and feed grain crops, to establish voluntary marketing certificate programs for producers participating in annual acreage reduction programs. Determines the amount of such certificates by multiplying the individual farm program acreage by the farm's program yield (at a minimum of 1985 levels). States that such certificates are nontransferable. Makes such certificates available to importers. Requires wheat and feed grains sold for domestic consumption to be accompanied by a market certificate. Permits noncertificate wheat or feed grains to be sold for export or used on the producing farm. Provides that wheat or feed grains produced in excess of a farm's certificates may be used on that farm, sold for export, or carried over to the subsequent marketing year. Sets 1986 through 1990 loan rates at: (1) $5.00 per bushel for wheat; and (2) $3.50 per bushel for corn. Sets forth penalties for violations of such provisions. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide export incentives in cash or in kind to U.S. exporters selling certificate-accompanied grain abroad. Title II: Debt Adjustment - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to direct the Secretary to provide a debt adjustment program of guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans. Includes provisions for debt write-offs and interest rate reductions in such program. Title III: Agricultural Loan Losses - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to permit an agricultural bank to amortize the loss from a restructured agricultural loan over ten years."
