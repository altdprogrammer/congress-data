Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to repeal provisions for Farm Credit Administration (FCA) approval of interest rates charged by Federal land banks, Federal intermediate credit banks, and banks for cooperatives. Prohibits the FCA from requiring System institutions to maintain capital levels by charging interest rates in excess of commercial rates."
