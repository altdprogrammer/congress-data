Requires, prior to the submission of such applications, State agencies to hold, after reasonable notice, public meetings to allow groups of artists, interested organizations, and the public to present views and make recommendations regarding the State plan. Requires State agencies to summarize such recommendations and their response. Requires such applications to include descriptions of: (1) the level of participation during the previous two years by artists, artists' organizations, and arts organizations in projects and productions receiving such assistance; (2) the extent to which such projects and productions are available to all people and communities in the State; and (3) existing or developing projects and productions to secure wider participation and greater availability. Prohibits plan approval unless all such application requirements are met. Revises provisions for cooperative programs under the challenge grants program to include support for State arts agencies cooperative efforts with local arts agencies (as well as with local arts groups).

Directs the President, in making appointments to the National Council on the Arts, to: (1) select individuals who have established records of distinguished service, or achieved eminence, in the arts (in addition to the current requirement that such appointees be private citizens who are widely recognized for their broad knowledge of, or expertise or profound interest in, the arts); and (2) give due regard to equitable representation of women, minorities, and person with disabilities who are involved in the arts. Increases the maximum monetary amount of grants which the NEA Chairperson may make without the prior recommendation of the National Council on the Arts. Authorizes the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to: (1) initiate and support programs and research which have substantial scholarly and cultural significance and reach or reflect the diversity and richness of the American cultural heritage, including minority, inner city, rural, or tribal community cultures; and (2) foster international programs and exchanges.

Requires, prior to the submission of such applications, State agencies to hold, after reasonable notice, public meetings to allow scholars, interested organizations, and the public to present views and make recommendations regarding the State plan. Requires State agencies to summarize such recommendations and their response. Requires such applications to include descriptions of: (1) the level of participation during the previous two years by scholars and scholarly organizations receiving such assistance; (2) the extent to which such programs are available to all people and communities in the State; and (3) existing or developing projects to secure wider participation and greater availability. Prohibits plan approval unless all such application requirements are met. Directs the Secretary of Labor, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, to prescribe fair labor standards, regulations, and procedures (based on the prevailing minimum compensation for similar employment and State sanitary and safety laws) concerning all professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel employed on projects or productions receiving NEH financial assistance. Includes Davis-Bacon Act requirements for prevailing wage rates for laborers and mechanics among the conditions for NEH grants for construction projects (the authority for such construction projects is provided earlier in this Act).

Directs the President, in making appointments to the National Council on the Humanities to: (1) select private citizens who are recognized for their broad knowledge of, expertise in, or commitment to the humanities (in addition to the current requirement that such appointees have established records of distinguished service and scholarship or creativity); and (2) give due regard to equitable representation of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities who are involved in the humanities. Provides that, for purposes of the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Director of the National Gallery of Art, and those members designated to serve by the Chairman of the Senate Commission on Art and Antiquities and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall not serve as members of the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities (the Federal Council). Directs the Federal Council to study: (1) the nature and level of Federal support for museums; (2) areas where such support overlaps or is inadequate, particularly in the case of emerging museums; (3) the impact of the Institute of Museum Services in carrying out its stated purpose; and (4) the impact and nature of conservation and preservation programs being carried out under this Act and other Federal laws and the areas where such programs overlap or are inadequate.

Sets forth guidelines for such recommendations. Directs the Chairpersons of NEA and NEH in selecting expert panels to review and make recommendations with respect to the approval of applications for financial assistance, to appoint persons who: (1) have exhibited expertise and leadership in the field under review; (2) broadly represent diverse characteristics in terms of aesthetic or humanistic perspective and geographical factors; and (3) broadly represent cultural diversity. Requires each Chairperson to assure that the membership of panels changes substantially from year to year, and that no more than 20 percent of the annual appointments shall be for service beyond the limit of three consecutive years on a subpanel. Directs each such Chairperson to give due regard to the need for experienced as well as new members on each panel. Requires expert panels to recommend for NEA funding only those applications and projects that, in the context in which they are presented and in the experts' view, foster excellence, reflect exceptional talent, and have significant literary, scholarly, cultural, or artistic merit. Prohibits any individual from serving on any NEA grants review panel or subpanel that is reviewing that individual's own application for funding. Directs the NEA and NEH Chairpersons to each conduct a post-award evaluation of projects, productions, and programs funded by their respective Endowments. Provides that such evaluation may include an audit to determine the accuracy of the following required reports. Requires the recipient to submit to the Chairperson of the Endowment involved: (1) a financial report; (2) a report describing the project, production, or program; and (3) if practicable (as determined by the Chairperson), a copy of such project, production, or program. Requires recipient compliance with these reporting requirements within 90 days after the end of the period for which funding is provided. Authorizes the Chairperson to extend such 90-day period only if the recipient shows good cause for such extension. Authorizes each Chairperson, upon determination that a recipient substantially fails to satisfy the purposes for which such funding is provided and specified criteria, to: (1) take into consideration the results of the post-award evaluation, for purposes of determining whether to provide any subsequent funding; (2) prohibit the recipient to use the Endowment's name, or in any way associate such project, production, or program with the Endowment; and (3) require that any publication of the project, production, or program contain a statement that NEA or NEH views are not reflected in such publication. Directs the NEA and NEH Chairpersons, with the cooperation of the Secretary of Education, to jointly conduct a study of: (1) the current state of arts and humanities teaching in the public elementary and secondary schools; and (2) the current and future availability of qualified instructional personnel, and other factors, affecting the quality of education in the arts and humanities in such schools. Requires the NEA and NEH to: (1) consult with specified congressional committees in the design and implementation of such study; and (2) within two years after the enactment of this Act, report to the President, the Congress, and the States on the findings of such study, along with views, recommendations, and evaluations relating to such arts and humanities education.
