    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-03-19", 
    "text": "International Human Dignity and Opportunity Act of 1985 - Title I: Human Dignity Generally - Reaffirms the U.S. policy of prohibiting importation into the United States of goods produced by forced, convict, or indentured labor. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that such policy is enforced. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to prohibit imports of all goods which are determined by the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board (established by this Act) to be the product of forced, convict, or indentured labor. Deletes the exception to such prohibition which allows imports of such goods if they are in short supply in the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to oppose any financial or technical assistance by the IMF or any of its facilities to any country which: (1) practices policies of official racial segregation; or (2) is listed by the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board as a country which supports international terrorism or as a country which has not taken adequate steps to halt illegal drug trafficking. Authorizes the President to waive U.S. opposition to IMF aid to such a country if national security or humanitarian reasons justify the waiver. Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to repeal certain provisions of such Act relating to apartheid and international terrorism. Declares that if a country is listed by the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board as a country which does not respect freedom of the press: (1) products from that country shall not be eligible to receive most-favored-nation treatment; (2) that country shall not be eligible to participate in any U.S. program which extends credits, credit guarantees, or investment guarantees; and (3) the President shall not conclude any commercial agreement with that country. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions against such countries if national security or humanitarian reasons justify the waiver. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President, subject to congressional approval, to waive certain sanctions against communist countries which deny freedom of emigration if the President makes specified determinations. Makes such waiver effective only if it is reported to the Congress and the Congress by a two-thirds vote in each House enacts a joint resolution approving that waiver. Provides for expedited consideration of such resolution. Requires the President to direct the U.S. representatives to international organizations and forums in which the Soviet Union participates to demand compliance by the Soviet Union with the Helsinki Accords. Directs the President to report to the Congress any failure of the Soviet Union to comply with the Helsinki Accords and to identify appropriate U.S. responses to Soviet noncompliance. Requires the President to direct the U.S. representatives to international organizations and forums to demand a full accounting of prisoners of conscience. Title II: Foreign Assistance Programs - Prohibits the United States from providing foreign assistance to any country whose votes in the most recent session of the United Nations General Assembly differed from the U.S. position by more than 85 percent. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition for national security or humanitarian reasons. Prohibits the United States from providing bilateral or multilateral assistance to any country which is listed by the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board as a country which supports international terrorism. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition for national security or humanitarian reasons. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to delete the prohibition in that Act against providing aid to countries that support international terrorism. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to direct the President to terminate all foreign military sales (currently all such sales, credits, and guarantees) to countries that aid international terrorists. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to suspend all U.S. bilateral and multilateral aid to or for a country if the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board lists such country as a country which has not taken adequate steps to halt illegal drug trafficking. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition for national security or humanitarian reasons. Prohibits the United States from providing any foreign assistance to any country which is listed by the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board as a country which does not respect freedom of the press. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition for national security or humanitarian reasons. Directs the President to give preference in allocating funds for food assistance programs to those countries which promote an agricultural sector consisting of small, individually-owned farms. Directs the President to reallocate U.S. economic assistance funds to expand programs designed to increase world food production, especially: (1) programs to increase research and development efforts by the private sector and the academic community; and (2) programs to promote the development of free-market agriculture. Directs the President to coordinate and target food aid and emergency relief programs to areas of countries in which a government engages in a deliberate policy of withholding from or preventing the free passage of food and nutrition to any segment of that same country's population. Title III: International Code for Trade and Democracy - Urges each company which has financial or other business relations with a communist country to implement the following principles: (1) encouraging compliance by such country with specified labor and human rights standards; (2) not providing any goods or technical aid to any business that supports international terrorism or illegal drug trafficking or that is engaged in the illegal acquisition of strategic technology; (3) fostering free market practices; (4) encouraging nondiscriminatory hiring policies; (5) discouraging dumping in western markets of goods that cause significant injury to western producers; and (6) not importing goods which are produced by forced, convict, or indentured labor. Title IV: United States Policy Toward Southern Africa - Prohibits the Government from entering into a contract with and from providing economic assistance to any person who establishes a business in South Africa or operates or controls a business in South Africa and invests in that business after the effective date of this subtitle, unless that person implements the following employment principles: (1) desegregation in any employment facility; (2) equal employment for all employees; (3) equal pay for equal work; (4) establishment of a minimum wage and salary structure; (5) increase in the representation of nonwhites in managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs; (6) improvement of the quality of employees' lives outside the work environment; and (7) implementation of fair labor practices. Authorizes the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board to issue guidelines on the implementation of the principles and to determine whether the affected persons are complying with the employment principles. Requires each affected person to submit to the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board: (1) an annual report on compliance with such employment principles; and (2) such other information as necessary. Requires the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board to establish in South Africa a Compliance Council to: (1) advise the Board concerning the implementation of the employment principles; and (2) monitor compliance with such principles. Sets forth administrative provisions governing the Council. Imposes such contract and economic assistance restriction on persons: (1) who, according to a determination of the Board, are not in compliance with the employment principles; or (2) whose compliance cannot be established because of a failure to provide information to the Board or because of the provision of false information. Requires that Board to issue a list to all Federal agencies of all persons with respect to whom determinations or redeterminations are made. Requires the Board, at least once every two years, to review and redetermine a person's compliance with the employment principles. Provides for judicial review of such determinations or redeterminations. Requires the Board to report annually to the Congress on the compliance of affected persons with the employment principles. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this subtitle for national security or humanitarian reasons. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State shall call an international conference of countries that do business with South Africa to develop a collective strategy for a constructive multilateral policy to promote the elimination of the practice of systematic racial discrimination in South Africa. Amends the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980 to repeal the limitation on U.S. aid to military or paramilitary operations in Angola. Requires the President to direct the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to oppose any settlement negotiated in the United Nations on the independence of Namibia which does not include a guarantee of the full withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should recognize the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) as the legitimate governing authority in Angola. Expresses the sense of the Congress that free elections should be held in Namibia and no specific political organization should be required to participate in those decisions. Title V: International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board - Establishes within the Department of State the International Human Dignity and Opportunity Certification Board consisting of five members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Directs the Board to submit to the President and the Congress annual reports on all foreign countries which shall include lists of those countries that support international terrorism, those that are not taking adequate steps to halt illegal drug trafficking, and those that are not respecting freedom of the press. Grants the Board the responsibility for determining whether imported goods are goods produced in a foreign country by convict, forced, or indentured labor. Requires the Board to carry out its functions under title IV of this Act. Sets forth administrative provisions governing the Board. Directs the Board to report annually to the President and to each House of Congress on its activities under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
