Permits the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to authorize a waiver for any agency if necessary to prevent a serious disruption in the execution of any of the agency's programs or operations. Requires the head of each executive agency to submit a report to the Congress and the President after the close of each fiscal year describing the agency's compliance with such limitation. Permits the Director to apportion annual appropriations and set asides in a manner consistent with this Act. Exempts any reserves established and any other actions taken to satisfy this Act from specified reporting requirements of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974."
