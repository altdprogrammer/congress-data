    "text": "Revises provisions concerning the provision of hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care and medical treatment to include as eligible for such care veterans: (1) who are former prisoners of war, for any disability; (2) of the Spanish-American War, Indian wars, Mexican border period, or of World War I, for any disability; and (3) for a non-service-connected disability, if such veteran is unable to defray the expenses of necessary hospital or nursing home care. Defines as sufficient evidence to qualify for such health care the fact that a veteran has income and assets, when combined with the income and assets of all those living with him/her in the household, equal to or less than twice the maximum annual rate of pension as provided under veterans' pension provisions. Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to prescribe regulations identifying the circumstances under which the Administrator will consider a veteran to be unable to defray expenses of needed care. Outlines provisions to be included in such regulations, including a schedule of unreimbursed medical expense contributions that a veteran will be expected to make before he or she will be deemed unable to defray expenses of needed care."
