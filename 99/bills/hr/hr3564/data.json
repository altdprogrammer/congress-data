Requires the environmental assessment which accompanies a repository site recommendation to include the environmental impact of transporting high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel through the region surrounding such site. Requires the Secretary of Energy to include, in the comprehensive public statement and in the environmental impact statement which must accompany a repository site recommendation, the effect of the transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel on States and Indian reservations which contain possible transportation routes. Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to any State or Indian tribe which demonstrates that such assistance is needed to maintain safe routes for the transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to submit draft revisions of the mission plan (a comprehensive report regarding the repository program) to the affected States and Indian tribes, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and to the Congress, within a specified time."
