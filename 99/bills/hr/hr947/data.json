    "date": "1985-02-06", 
    "text": "Comprehensive Adolescent Pregnancy Program Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to authorize the Secretary of Education to use discretionary funds to carry out a program to assist elementary and secondary schools to introduce and improve family life education programs. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out such family life education assistance program either directly or through grants and contracts with institutions of higher education, State and local educational agencies, research organizations, and other public and private agencies. Requires such program to provide for: (1) training of educational personnel; (2) educational materials; (3) curriculum development and evaluation; (4) technical assistance; (5) a clearinghouse to evaluate, catalogue, and disseminate teacher and student materials; and (6) grants to State and local educational agencies for model family life education programs at the elementary and secondary school levels which shall be conducted with the advice of advisory committees broadly representative of the community to be served. Requires that such family life education assistance program be carried out in coordination with related activities carried out under title X (Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs) of the Public Health Service Act. Requires that at least ten percent of the Secretary's discretionary funds under ECIA be made available in each fiscal year for activities under such family life education assistance program. Amends title X (Population Research and voluntary Family Planning Programs) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize project grants and contracts for comprehensive services appropriate to the needs of sexually active adolescents who need and desire such services in order to avoid unintended pregnancies. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make such grants and contracts to public and nonprofit private entities to assist in the provision of such services through the voluntary family planning projects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 for title X grants and contracts for: (1) the voluntary family planning projects; (2) the comprehensive services to adolescents (as established by this Act); and (3) personnel training for family planning service programs. Revises title X provisions for family planning information and education. Authorizes grants and contracts for making available information and education to enable persons to make responsible choices concerning human sexuality, pregnancy, and parenthood. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make such grants to public and nonprofit private entities and such contracts to public and private (including for-profit) entities to assist in making such information and education available through appropriate community organizations to all persons desiring it. Requires: (1) special emphasis on adolescents and parents; and (2) inclusion of information about the availability of a broad range of family planning methods and services. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to provide, directly and indirectly, technical assistance for development, implementation, and evaluation of such information and education projects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 for such family planning information and education projects. Amends title IV, part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of the Social Security Act to repeal provisions added by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 which require consideration of parental and certain other familial income in determining the AFDC eligibility of adolescent parents who live in their parents' home. Provides for AFDC payments to a pregnant woman from the time her pregnancy is medically verified. Removes restrictions on AFDC payments to meet the needs of an unborn child or to meet the needs of a woman occasioned by or resulting from her pregnancy. Amends title XIX (Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs) (Medicaid) to require that Medicaid provide for making medical assistance available with respect to services related to abortion in the same manner as such assistance is provided with respect to other pregnancy-related services. Revises title XX of the Public Health Services Act. Changes the name of title XX from \"Adolescent Family Life Demonstration Projects\" to \"Services for Pregnant Adolescents and Adolescent Parents.\" Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make grants and contracts with public and nonprofit private entities to provide services for pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, and their families. Lists such services. Allows such services to be provided to: (1) pregnant adolescents under age 18 who have decided to carry their pregnancy to term, the fathers of the infants involved in the pregnancy, individuals who have agreed to share responsibility for such infants, and the guardians of such infants; and (2) mothers of pre-school age children who were under age 18 at the time of the birth of such children, the fathers of such children, individuals who have agreed to share responsibility for such children, and the guardians of such children. Directs the Secretary of HHS, in approving applications for grants and contracts to provide such services, to give priority to and encourage applications from entities that serve an area where: (1) the incidence of adolescent childbearing is high; (2) the proportion of low income and minority families is high; and (3) adolescent pregnancy services are most needed. Requires that service providers give assurances that: (1) priority in the furnishing such services will be given to persons from low income families and to persons who may experience other barriers to such services; (2) any fees will be charged according to an approved schedule which takes into account the difficulty adolescents face in paying for such services, no fees will be charged for services to persons from low income families (except if paid by a third party), and there will be no discrimination because of an individual's inability to pay; (3) maximum use will be made of funds from other Federal or State programs; (4) the role of families will be maximized in assisting adolescents during pregnancy and parenthood, but family participation will not be required; (5) the community will be involved in program planning and implementation; and (6) reports and data will be furnished on the number and characteristics of persons served, services provided, and results achieved. Requires that such services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents be provided only on a voluntary basis and only after the individuals seeking such services have been advised of the benefits and risks of all the courses of action available and have had an opportunity to choose freely among them, including referral to another source of care when indicated. Provides that acceptance of any such information or services shall not be prerequisite to eligibility for or receipt of any other service or assistance. Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a systematic reporting system capable of yielding comprehensive data on which to base service figures and program evaluations. Directs the Secretary to report, on or before each January 1, on the activities supported under such services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent partners. Requires such report to include specified information as well as plans and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 for such services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents."
