Permits the Commission to: (1) condition equipment certification on performance testing results; and (2) require prototypes or production samples of equipment manufactured at facilities remote from Commission offices to be submitted to the Commission or a qualified entity for testing. Exempts equipment manufactured in any foreign country which the President determines does not impose discriminatory requirements on imported U.S. equipment."
