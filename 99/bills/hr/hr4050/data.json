Directs the District of Columbia to submit its choice of a District of Columbia construction site or sites to the Congress within: (1) ten days of enactment for a temporary facility; and (2) 30 days for a permanent facility for District of Columbia Code (D.C. Code) violators. Requires the Attorney General to designate Federal prisons for the confinement of D.C. Code violators whenever the Lorton prison or D.C. jail reach capacity during the year following enactment of this Act, unless the D.C. Government does not comply with the provisions of this Act. Prohibits the early release or parole of violent offenders as a means of alleviating prison overcrowding."
