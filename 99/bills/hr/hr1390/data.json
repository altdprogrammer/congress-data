Provides that if the lessee of such lands is a concessioner, corporation, or other organization, such lessee may sublease the property to its employees or to any individual whose residence is solely in support of Yosemite National Park or the El Portal site. Requires lessees to pay to the United States the fair rental value of the leased lands. (Under current law, lessees must pay an annual rental fee for such lands.) Permits the use of leasing revenue as an offset against administrative costs. Requires the Secretary to complete the exchange of specified lands within the boundaries of Ink Creek Ranch in Tehama County, California, within six months of enactment. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations establishing leasing qualifications, submitting such regulations to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires the Secretary to lease such housing through an agent to prevent the use of personal influence by Department of the Interior employees."
