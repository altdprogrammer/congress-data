Requires the Secretary to establish a 20-year restoration program (based on the Klamath River Basin Fisheries Resource Plan as developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) to restore the anadromous fish populations of the Area to optimum levels and to maintain such levels. Establishes a Klamath Fishery Management Council (the Council) to: (1) establish a comprehensive long-term plan and policy for management of the in-river and ocean fishery harvest; (2) make recommendations to specified public and private agencies; and (3) conduct public hearings on proposed regulations. Sets forth the criteria for Council recommendations. Outlines administrative provisions governing the Council. Establishes a Klamath River Basin Fisheries Task Force which shall: (1) assist the Secretary in carrying out the restoration program; (2) assist, and coordinate with, Federal, State, and local governmental or private anadromous fish restoration projects within the Area; and (3) conduct any other activity necessary to accomplish the goals of the program. Authorizes the Task Force to advise the Council. Outlines administrative provisions governing the Task Force. Requires the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the California Department of Fish and Game and to specify enforcement activities within the Area. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 2005. Requires that half the cost of the restoration program must be provided by non-Federal sources. Provides for non-cash in-kind contributions to such program."
