    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the United States Code to insert: (1) \"Part C - Load Lines of Vessels;\" and (2) \"Part J - Measurement of Vessels.\" Combines the requirements of specified statutes regarding load line criteria and applies such criteria to American vessels on international voyages and domestic ocean voyages. (Applies to American-flag vessels the load line criteria of the 1969 Load Line Convention to which the United States is a signatory.) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary of the Navy in time of war) to: (1) consider local conditions when making load line determinations; (2) exempt vessels which operate under equivalent safety conditions; and (3) reduce the minimum freeboard of such vessels. Requires the Secretary to delegate to the American Bureau of Shipping (or other similarly qualified organizations) the authority to assign load lines. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a country that is a signatory to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, the authority to assign load lines, survey vessels, determine load line markings and issue an International Load Line Certificate (1966) if such vessels are intended to be engaged on a foreign voyage. Authorizes the Secretary to require that loading information be provided to the person in charge of a vessel in a language such person understands. Permits a vessel to be operated only if the loading distribution, stability and margin of strength are adequate for the voyage or movement intended. Exempts submersible vessels from such restriction. Implements the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 to apply to American vessels the international standards of vessel measurement. (Such Convention was ratified by the United States in 1982.) Provides that the applicability of tonnage-based laws that become effective after July 18, 1994 (and the applicability of certain tonnage-based laws in effect before July 19, 1994) will be based on convention tonnage. Requires applicable vessels to be measured by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating in accordance with the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (Convention) and this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue such vessels an International Tonnage Certificate (1969) upon completion of the measurement. Requires the Secretary to measure a documented vessel under Federal regulatory measurement procedures in addition to Convention measurement procedures if the owner of such vessel requests the Federal regulatory measurement. Requires the Secretary to accept the tonnage and certificate of vessels of any country that complies with or approximates the provisions of the Convention. Authorizes the Secretary to inspect any vessel to verify compliance with such provisions. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations for regulatory measurement systems which allow for tonnage determinations comparable to those that could have been assigned under specified Federal laws in existence immediately before enactment of this Act. Provides that the tonnage of spaces prescribed by the Secretary under dual tonnage measurement must be comparable to those the Secretary could have excluded under existing law. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act. Requires user fees collected for Coast Guard services to be deposited in the Treasury general fund and ascribed to Coast Guard activities (thereby implementing a user fee system for the Coast Guard). Requires the Secretary to submit a study (and an interim progress report) to the Congress regarding the effect of a complete conversion to the international tonnage measurement system."
