Requires the President's initial and final sequestration orders to be in accordance with initial and revised reports by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Requires the Director of OMB (currently, the Director of CBO) to notify the Congress of low economic growth triggering action to suspend sequestration procedures. Repeals provisions setting forth alternative sequestration reporting procedures that were to be followed in the event that the joint CBO-OMB-General Accounting Office reporting procedures were invalidated."
