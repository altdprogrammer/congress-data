    "text": "Health Services Amendments Act of 1985 - Title I: Health Maintenance Organizations - Amends the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the authorization for the following grants and contracts for health maintenance organizations (HMOs): (1) feasibility surveys; (2) planning; and (3) initial development costs. Permits loans and loan guarantees for the initial operating costs of HMOs only to those organizations which received a grant or loan or entered into a contract with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in FY 1981 through 1985. Eliminates authority for loans and loan guarantees for the acquisition and construction of ambulatory health care facilities. Eliminates from financial assistance application requirements the requirement for health systems agency review. Limits borrowing by the loan guarantee fund to cover only guarantees made by the Secretary prior to October 1, 1985. Eliminates the requirement that HMOs periodically demonstrate their compliance with certain quality standards. Directs the Secretary to update the digest of State laws relating to HMOs annually (formerly quarterly). Eliminates specified reporting provisions. Extends the authorization of appropriations through FY 1989 for grants for training and technical assistance. Title II: Primary Care-Directs the Secretary to prescribe criteria for determining the specific shortages of personal health services of an area or population group. Prohibits the Secretary from designating a medically underserved population or removing such a determination unless the following are given notice and provided an opportunity for comment: (1) the chief executive officer of the State; (2) local officers in the State; and (3) the State organization which represents a majority of community health centers in such State. Permits the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of agreement with a State. Provides that such memorandum may include provisions permitting such State to: (1) analyze the need for primary health services for medically underserved populations; (2) assist in the planning and development of new community health centers; (3) review and comment upon annual program plans and budgets of community health centers; (4) assist communities in the development of clinical practices and fiscal and administrative systems; and (5) share information and data. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1988 for such purposes. Limits the expenditure of such appropriations. Repeals the primary care block grant program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 for migrant health centers. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
