Provides an exception for small businesses whose depreciation deduction does not exceed $5,000. Prohibits a taxpayer from hiring new employees to replace former employees intentionally released by the taxpayer for the purpose of meeting this requirement. Provides that a business which does not meet this requirement shall be limited to the depreciation available under the former asset depreciation range system."
