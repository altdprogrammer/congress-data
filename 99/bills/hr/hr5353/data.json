    "as": "Passed House amended",

    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Haida Land Exchange Act of 1986 - Offers to exchange the United States' interest in the surface estate of the Haida Traditional Use Sites, Alaska, for Haida Corporation's interest in Goat Island, South Pass Islands, and other specified lands. Includes a cash payment to Haida. Offers Haida $3,000 per acre for up to 1,000 acres of the Haida Exchange Lands. Grants Haida Corporation one year within which to accept such offer. Offers to exchange the United States' interest in lands of equivalent value for Sealaska's interest in Goat Island, South Pass Islands, and other specified lands. Grants Sealaska the subsurface estate of the Haida Traditional Use Sites, Alaska, in exchange for an equal acreage of subsurface estate in the Haida Exchange Lands. Grants Sealaska 180 days in which to accept the U.S. offer. Requires Haida Corporation to accept its exchange offer before an acceptance by Sealaska would be considered effective. Includes Goat Island and South Pass Islands in the Tongass National Forest, Alaska, should such lands be exchanged. Requires that such lands be managed primarily for conservation purposes. Treats lands conveyed to Haida Corporation or Sealaska pursuant to this Act as lands conveyed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Withdraws from all forms of entry for 18 months the U.S. lands offered for conveyance. States that payments to the Haida Corporation under this Act shall be defrayed from timber and resource receipts from National Forest System lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw from all forms of entry Federal lands in Alaska outside any conservation system unit for selection by Haida Corporation. Entitles Haida Corporation to select from such lands in accordance with its selection rights for up to one year. Conveys the surface estate in selected lands to Haida Corporation and the subsurface estate in such lands to Sealaska. Terminates all such withdrawals two years after the last withdrawal is made. Authorizes appropriations for preliminary work related to the establishment of an Information and Education Center about the resources of Alaska. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report to the Congress within one year on a development plan for such Center."
