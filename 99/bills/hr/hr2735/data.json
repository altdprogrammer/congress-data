Requires the 30-day acquisition waiting period to be extended for an additional 30 days (or 60 days if, after the acquisition, the U.S. assets or probable annual U.S. sales of the acquiring person would exceed $1,000,000,000) if the Federal Trade Commission or the Attorney General requires submission of additional information or documentary material concerning the proposed acquisition."
