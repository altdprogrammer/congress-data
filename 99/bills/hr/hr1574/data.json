Requires the use of the individual level premium cost method to establish the annual actuarial cost of such plan benefits and expenses. Requires that accrued benefits upon separation from service be not less than the actuarial accumulated value of the normal costs of such benefits for all periods before the separation. Provides that certain actuarial assumptions and methods of computing a participant's current or future benefit accruals, under specified types of defined benefit plans, shall not be treated as unreasonable solely because they take into account only so much of the current or future compensation of the participant as is recognized as anticipated compensation at the time of any election under the plan."
