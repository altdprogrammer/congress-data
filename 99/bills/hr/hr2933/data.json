Reduces, in six steps over an eight-year period, the maximum hours which an employee must work in order to qualify for overtime pay to 32 hours. Decreases the number of hours which certain employees who are excepted from the present 40 per week maximum hour rule must work in order to qualify for overtime pay. Prohibits any employer from scheduling an employee to work overtime without the employee's consent. Sets forth a formula for determining liquidated damages for violations of such prohibition."
