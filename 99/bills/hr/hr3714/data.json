    "text": "Copper Relief Act of 1985 - Declares it U.S. policy to negotiate agreements temporarily limiting copper production by foreign copper producers in order to: (1) ensure an adequate supply of domestic copper; (2) expand employment in the copper industry; and (3) stabilize foreign copper production. Declares that if such an agreement is not reached the President should be empowered to impose an additional tariff on all imported copper for, at most, five years. Directs the President, acting through the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), to undertake negotiations during the six months after enactment of this Act with all major copper producing countries for the purpose of achieving voluntary restraint agreements. Directs the President to report to the Congress whether such voluntary restraint agreements will take effect between the United States and the major copper producing countries. Directs the USTR, if such voluntary restraint agreements take effect, to monitor the production of unwrought copper by those countries during each 12-month period within the copper import restraint period. Directs the USTR to report the results of such monitoring to the Congress. Authorizes the President to impose a surcharge on all copper imports if voluntary restraint agreements do not take effect for the copper import restraint period. Authorizes the President to impose a surcharge on copper imports if the USTR reports that major copper producing countries during a specified 12-month period did not satisfactorily comply with the voluntary restraint agreements. Provides for termination of such surcharges if certain conditions are met."
