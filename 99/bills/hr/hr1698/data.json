Prohibits the Secretary from selling any petroleum product under this Act at less than 90 percent of the sales price of the comparable petroleum product being sold in the same area at the time. Requires the Secretary to acquire petroleum product for the Reserve in the same amount as the total amount of petroleum product sold pursuant to the test drawdown and distribution. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Congress a detailed explanation of any test implemented under this Act."
