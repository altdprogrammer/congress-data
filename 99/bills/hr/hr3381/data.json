    "text": "Federal Computer Systems Protection Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful to knowingly obtain access or attempt to obtain access to a computer as part of a scheme to defraud or obtain money or property by false pretenses or to embezzle, steal, or convert the property of another if: (1) the computer is owned by, under contract to, or operated on behalf of the U.S. Government or a financial institution; or (2) if in committing or concealing the offense two or more computers are used which are located in different States or in a State and a foreign country. Makes it unlawful to knowingly and willfully without authorization damage, destroy, or attempt to damage or destroy such a computer or any computer programs or data contained in such a computer. Makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally without any authorization obtain access to such a computer. Provides that anyone who violates any provision of this Act shall forfeit to the United States any interest in any computer and computer program which has been used to commit the violation. Specifies that this Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a State or Federal law enforcement agency, or of an intelligence agency of the United States."
