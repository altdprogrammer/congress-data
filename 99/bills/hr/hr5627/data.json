    "text": "Northern Ireland Fair Employment Practices Act - Prohibits an article from being imported into the United States from Northern Ireland unless documentation is presented at the time of entry indicating that the enterprise which manufactured or assembled such article was in compliance at the time of manufacture with certain fair employment principles (such as freedom from religious discrimination). Provides that such principles are based on the MacBride Principles, a nine point set of guidelines for fair employment in Northern Ireland. Requires that any U.S. person who has a branch or office in Northern Ireland or who controls an enterprise in Northern Ireland in which more than 20 people are employed shall take the necessary steps to insure that such employment principles are implemented and that this Act is complied with. Requires each such U.S. person to report to the Secretary of Commerce on compliance with this Act. Sets forth the fair employment principles. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this Act in the interest of national security. Requires such waiver to become effective 90 days after the President submits a justification of such waiver to the Congress unless the Congress adopts a joint resolution disapproving the waiver. Provides for expedited consideration of such resolution."
