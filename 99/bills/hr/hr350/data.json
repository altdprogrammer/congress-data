Sets forth enforcement procedures. Allows the Attorney General or any person who pays a severance tax to bring a civil action in a district court of the United States in order to enforce such limitation. Directs the Secretary of Energy to determine the severance tax collected by each State during 1978 (1978 being the base year used in determining excessive State severance taxes)."
