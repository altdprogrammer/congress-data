Authorizes the Secretary to add eligibility criteria to basic and supplemental grants to States which implement alcohol traffic safety programs. Identifies such criteria as: (1) the establishment of mandatory education programs for new operators of motor vehicles and persons convicted of driving while intoxicated; and (2) comprehensive education programs for owners, employees, and patrons of establishments authorized to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises."
