Rept. 99-954) Domestic Volunteer Service Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (the Act) to set forth a volunteerism policy for ACTION, the Federal domestic volunteer agency. Revises provisions relating to the recruitment and assignment of volunteers under the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. Requires the ACTION Director (the Director) to report on such recruitment and assignment activities to the appropriate congressional committees within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year. Establishes a VISTA Literacy Corps to expand efforts to address the problem of illiteracy. Provides for assignment of volunteers to projects and programs that provide assistance to functionally illiterate and illiterate individuals who are unserved or underserved by existing literacy education programs, with special emphasis upon disadvantaged individuals having the highest risk of illiteracy, and individuals with the lowest reading and educational level of competence. Sets forth priorities for such programs and projects. Provides that the Literacy Corps shall consist of all VISTA volunteers who are working on literacy projects and programs. Provides that specified funds made available for the Literacy Corps shall be used to supplement and not supplant the level of services under VISTA provisions in FY 1986 to address the problem of illiteracy. Adds a description of the purposes of the University Year for ACTION (UYA) program of full-time volunteer antipoverty service-learning by students enrolled in institutions of higher education. Includes Indian reservations among the areas where special volunteer programs may be located. Includes Indian groups under the definitions of \"public agencies or organizations\" and \"Federal, State, or local agencies\" for purposes of the Act. Sets forth provisions relating to volunteers serving without stipend. Revises provisions for Foster Grandparent Programs and for the Senior Companion Program to allow individuals who are not low-income persons to serve as nonstipend volunteers in such programs under specified conditions. Sets forth evaluation requirements. Requires each program under the Act to be evaluated at least once every three years. Requires the Director, by December 31, 1988, to: (1) evaluate the impact of ACTION Agency programs carried out under title II (National Older American Volunteer Programs) that relate to services that assist families caring for frail and disabled adult family members; (2) evaluate the impact of nonstipend volunteers who participate in Foster Grandparent and Senior Companions programs; and (3) report on such evaluations to specified congressional committees. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for the following National Volunteer Antipoverty Programs: (1) Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) with separate authorization of appropriations for the VISTA Literacy Corps; (2) service-learning programs; and (3) special volunteer programs. Requires that, from national volunteer antipoverty program funding for FY 1987 through 1989, amounts be first made available as are necessary to provide specified minimum amounts of VISTA volunteer service years. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for the following National Older American Volunteer Programs: (1) Retired Senior Volunteer Program; (2) Foster Grandparent Program; and (3) Senior Companion Program. Extends through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for administration and coordination under the Act."
