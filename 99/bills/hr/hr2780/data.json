    "text": "Superfund Amendments of 1985 - Title I: Provisions Relating Primarily to Response and Liability - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)(Superfund) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish reportable quantities for all hazardous substances by December 31, 1986. Directs the Administrator to give primary attention to releases which may present a threat to public health. Confirms the President's discretion to decide when responsible parties are authorized to conduct cleanup actions in lieu of Superfund-financed responses. Requires short-term removal actions undertaken by the Administrator to contribute to the highest degree possible to the efficient performance of any long-term action. Increases the maximum time and funding limit on short-term response actions when appropriate. Limits the 50 percent State cleanup obligation to those facilities which are both owned and operated by the State. Credits States with expenditures made at National Priorities List (NPL) sites on cost-eligible response actions. Revises other State cost-sharing measures. Grants EPA employees of contractors the necessary access to facilities and information to determine if the need for a response action exists. Prescribes a cleanup schedule for Superfund, requiring an evaluation within two years of sites on the Emergency Response and Remedial Investigation System (ERRIS) list for possible inclusion on the NPL. Sets a schedule for the conduct of remedial investigations and feasibility studies (RIFS) for NPL sites, requiring the commencement of remedial action at a minimum of 90 percent of such facilities within one year of the RIFS completion. Directs the Administrator to revise the National Contingency Plan (NCP) within 18 months to reflect this Act's amendments. Requires the review of the hazard ranking system within one year. Permits individuals to petition the Administrator for a preliminary hazard assessment at a site. Includes contamination of the ambient air as a criterion for ranking a hazard. Eliminates the requirement that the NPL contain at least 400 sites. Prohibits the Administrator from taking abatement action against any release resulting from an applied pesticide registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Makes liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances requiring abatement actions strict, joint, and several. Includes all vessels releasing hazardous substances within the jurisdiction of the United States under the liability provisions of CERCLA. Makes certain investigatory and assessment costs recoverable from the responsible party. Exempts from liability for all but negligent actions government agencies responding to a hazardous substance emergency. Directs the Administrator and each Governor to appoint Federal and State trustees, respectively, for natural resources, creating a rebuttable presumption that their assessment of damages to such resources is valid. States that cleanup costs incurred in a response action constitute a Federal lien against the property of a responsible party. Sets forth evidentiary requirements for establishing financial responsibility. Permits direct action against a financial guarantor if the person liable is financially or physically unavailable for redress. Entitles such a guarantor to all rights and defenses available to the liable party. Limits the liability of such guarantor to its financial responsibility to the responsible party. Increases criminal penalties and adds certain civil penalties for violations of this Act, including failure to provide accurate information at specified times. Directs the Administrator to establish a program for alternative or innovative treatment technologies which can be used in remedial actions through research contracts and grants, information exchange, and demonstrations at NPL sites in each of the EPA regions. Requires the Administrator to revise the NCP to include the use of such technologies in remedial actions. Authorizes the use of Superfund monies for such research. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress an evaluation of the demonstration projects. Esablishes a total fund level of $2,020,000,000 for each of five years, through FY 1990. Authorizes the use of Superfund monies for the authorities created by this Act. Eliminates the use of Superfund for payment of natural resource damage claims.

Establishes a six-year statute of limitations for cost recovery actions. Authorizes a State to require contributions to a fund to pay the costs of hazardous substance response actions or damages. Establishes within the Public Health Service the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), headed by an Administrator. Requires ATSDR to implement the health-related authorities of this Act. Directs such Administrator to establish and maintain a listing of areas closed to the public or otherwise restricted in use because of contamination by hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants. Directs the Administrator of EPA to list and periodically revise a list of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants which pose the most significant potential threat to human health. Directs the Administrator of ATSDR to establish and maintain an inventory of information on the health effects of each listed substance. Requires such Administrator to also develop toxicological profiles for each such substance, assessing the current state of knowledge of their deleterious effects, and revising such profiles at least every three years. Requires the Administrator to initiate research where inadequate information on a substance is available. Requires Federal coordination of research efforts. Requires the Administrator of ATSDR to perform a health assessment for each NPL facility where a significant possibility exists that a human population has been exposed to hazardous substances existing at such facility and a significant threat of adverse health effects exists. Bases the selection of such facilities on criteria developed by the Administrator of EPA. Permits the Administrator of ATSDR to conduct health assessments at other facilities as well. Authorizes individuals to petition the Administrator of EPA for a health assessment of a site where evidence of human exposure to hazardous substances exists. Requires the completion of health assessments before the completion of remedial investigation and feasibility studies (RIFS) whenever possible. Grants priority to those sites where the potential risk to human health appears highest. Requires State or local officials conducting a health assessment to report the results and recommendations to the Administrators. Requires the Administrator of ATSDR to provide the affected State and the Administrator of EPA with the results and recommendations of any ATSDR assessment. Includes the costs of an assessment among recoverable cleanup costs whenever such assessment reveals human exposure to a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Directs the Administrator of ATSDR to conduct a pilot study of health effects of exposure whenever justified by an assessment to determine if full scale epidemiological studies are appropriate. Requires the Administrator to establish a registry of exposed persons if appropriate. Directs the Administrator to initiate a health surveillance program for an exposed population if justified by an epidemiological study or exposure registry. Requires the Administrator to report biennially to the Administrator of EPA and ATSDR's activities under this Act.

Requires peer review of all ATSDR studies and research. Requires the Administrator of ATSDR to provide States and health professionals with educational materials on exposure-related issues. Requires the Administrator of EPA to provide a reasonable opportunity for public comment on any proposed plan for remedial action before it is implemented. Requires the Administrator to publish an explanation of any divergences from such plan or public comments. Authorizes the Administrator to make assistance available to affected individuals to help them evaluate and assess technical information and data. Prohibits the Administrator from taking a response action to certain types of releases unless such releases constitute a public health or environmental emergency. Prohibits response to releases: (1) of naturally occurring substances; (2) of building products; (3) into drinking water supply systems due to expected deterioration; and (4) from coal mining sites. Grants highest cleanup priority to releases which have contaminated or closed a sole or principal drinking water source. Requires the consideration of certain factors when adopting offsite remedies, including the long-term risks and uncertainties of land disposal. Exempts response-action contractors from liability for nonnegligent cleanup activities if they would not otherwise have been liable. Requires Federal agencies to notify buyers or transferees of Federal land where hazardous substances were disposed of or stored. Requires the Administrator to select appropriate cost-effective remedial actions in accordance with the NCP. Requires remedial actions selected to provide sufficient control or amelioration of the hazardous substance so as to protect human health and the environment. Requires such measures to take into account the long-term effectiveness of the solution and the alternative technologies available to the maximum extent possible. Requires a standard of control at least as strict as that provided by any other applicable Federal environmental law such as the Safe Drinking Water Act. Requires offsite disposal to be in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Permits the waiver of such requirements as specified. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into agreements whereby the releasor or any potentially responsible person conducts the remedial response. Permits the Administrator to fund part of such response. Limits the liability of the cleaning up party to that specified in the agreement. Permits the Administrator to take action against any person not a party to such agreement. Enters such agreements in the appropriate U.S. district court as consent agreements, enforceable as such. Directs the Administrator to notify potentially responsible parties of each other's identities and of the seriousness of the necessary cleanup, providing a moratorium on the commencement of remedial action for a specified period after such notice has been given.

Permits the Administrator to commence remedial action if no good faith proposal is forthcoming within a specified period. Authorizes the Administrator to proceed on remedial actions where a significant public health threat exists regardless of the status of negotiations. Authorizes the Administrator to agree to refrain from pursuing any future liability of a person if an approved response action would be expedited and the person is in full compliance with the consent decree. Permits such an agreement only in the public interest after an evaluation of the effectiveness of the remedy and the nature of the remaining risks. Places premiums from such agreements into a contingency fund for future remedial actions at other facilities. Permits the Administrator to settle with persons whose share of response costs is not substantial. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Terminates the Post-closure Liability Fund's responsibility to fund the cleanup of already closed sites where hazardous waste was stored in compliance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
