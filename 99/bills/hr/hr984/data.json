Directs the Administrator to promulgate, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, rules for the sale of takeoff and landing rights at such Airport. Establishes two categories for the sale of takeoff and landing rights: (1) commuter air carriers; and (2) air carriers other than commuter air carriers. Prohibits the transfer of air carrier rights from one category to the other, but permits the transfer of such rights within the same air carrier category. Requires the Administrator to report annually to the Congress regarding the allocation of takeoff and landing rights by sale."
