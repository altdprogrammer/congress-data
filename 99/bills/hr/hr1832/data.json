    "text": "Office of Competition and Economic Concentration Act of 1985 - Establishes within the executive branch the Office of Competition and Economic Concentration headed by a Director appointed by the President. Requires the Director to: (1) collect statistical information regarding the extent of concentration of ownership or control of commercial enterprises; (2) study the extent of competitive participation by individual commercial enterprises; (3) cooperate with executive agencies and private organizations to develop tabulation systems to analyze the commercial activities of enterprises in an area of trade; (4) submit recommendations to the President and the Congress on the operation of antitrust laws and on the improvement of Federal programs evaluating the extent of concentration; (5) establish new programs to record the extent of concentration; and (6) prepare and publish reports. Requires executive agencies to supply any information requested by the Director and to advise the Director of restrictions applicable to the disclosure of such information. Requires commercial enterprises that own or control substantial assets located in the United State to submit certain requested information to the Director, unless such information can be obtained through an agency or compliance with the request would impose an undue burden on the enterprise. Allows an enterprise to petition the Director to modify an information request to eliminate any undue burden. Requires the Director to issue a written decision with respect to such petition. Provides for judicial review. Grants the Attorney General enforcement power if any commercial enterprise fails to comply with any requirement imposed by this Act. Establishes procedures for confidentiality of information."
