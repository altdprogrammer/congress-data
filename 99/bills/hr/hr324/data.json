    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act - Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to remove the requirement that budget acts disapproved by the Mayor be sent to the President. Requires that proposed budget acts for the District of Columbia be read twice by the Council of the District of Columbia, with at least 13 days intervening between such readings. (Under current law, budget acts for the District are excluded from the requirement that proposed acts be read twice by the council.) Authorizes the Council to establish the maximum amount of funds for allocation to the District's court system but prohibits the Council from specifying the purposes of expenditures. Allows the enactment of the District's budget without congressional approval. Allows the hiring of employees when such positions are approved by acts of the Council. (Currently, positions may be authorized only by Acts of Congress). Declares that the District government will operate on the preceding fiscal year's budget when the budget act for any fiscal year has not timely become law. Provides that expenditures of funds derived from revenue bonds shall not be affected by budget adoption procedures of the Council. Extends the interim loan authority of the District until October 1, 1985, or upon enactment of the FY 1986 appropriation Act whichever is later. Requires the Council, not later than 120 days after enactment of this Act, to enact a budget and accounting act for the District."
