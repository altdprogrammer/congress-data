    "text": "Nevada Wilderness Act of 1985 - Title I: Short Title, Findings, and Purposes-Sets forth the short title, findings, and purposes of this Act. Title II: Designates the following lands in Nevada as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System; (1) the Mount Charleston Wilderness in the Toiyabe National Forest; (2) lands in the Humboldt National Forest which shall be incorporated in the Jarbidge Wilderness; (3) the Mount Moriah Wilderness in the Humboldt National Forest; and (4) the Boundary Peak Wilderness in the Inyo National Forest. Title III: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management- Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nevada shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nevada which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions-Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas, subject to mandatory review by the Secretary of Agriculture. Permits the expressly authorized use of motorized equipment for the maintenance of such livestock. Requires the Secretary to report periodically to the Congress on livestock grazing in these wilderness areas. States that this Act does not exempt the Federal Government from the Nevada water laws. Does not preempt State jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in the national forests. States that the Congress does not intend the creation of buffer zones around the designated wilderness areas or any abrogation of the standards of the Clean Air Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to continue mineral assessments in such lands, permitting the use of motorized equipment and roads for such purposes. Continues access by local municipalities for maintaining watershed facilities and other health and safety concerns. Continues unaffected the Federal responsibility for predator control activities."
