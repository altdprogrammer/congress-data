    "text": "Federal Domestic Uranium Purchases Act - Prohibits any Federal agency from purchasing uranium that is mined or processed: (1) outside the United States; or (2) by a business within the United States which is either owned or controlled by persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States. Exempts from this proscription uranium purchases from the National Defense Stockpile. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 with respect to contractual prices established by the Department of Energy for the production or enrichment of special nuclear material to repeal the requirement that such prices be established on the basis of recovery of the Government's costs over a reasonable period of time."
