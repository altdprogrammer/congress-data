    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 99-955) Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) to revise and extend provisions under the Act. Title I: Amendments to the General Provisions - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) to direct the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to ensure that the Rehabilitation Services Administration staff shall: (1) be in sufficient numbers to meet program needs and at levels to attract and maintain the most qualified personnel; and (2) include individuals with training experience in rehabilitation services and with competencies which meet professional standards. Requires that the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (the Commissioner) have substantial experience in rehabilitation and rehabilitation program management. Revises the formula for the Federal share under the Act. Revises the definitions of \"evaluation of rehabilitation potential\" and \"severe handicap.\" Adds defintions of \"employability,\" \"rehabilitation engineering,\" and \"supported employment.\" Replaces the phrase \"handicapped individual\" with the phrase \"individual with handicaps.\" Redefines \"individual with severe handicaps.\" Includes Indian tribal organizations under the term \"public or nonprofit agency or organization.\" Authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) provide monitoring and conduct evaluations; and (2) appoint necessary task forces.

Requires that the annual report include an evaluation of the status of individuals with severe handicaps participating in programs under this Act. Requires that the Secretary's annually published summaries of program and project evaluations include the standards used for such evaluations. Revises provisions for program and project evaluation to: (1) require the use of appropriate methodology and evaluative research designs; and (2) give the Commissioner, rather than the Secretary, responsibility for carrying out such evaluations. Permits up to one-half of one percent of funds appropriated for discretionary grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under the Act to be used to provide non-Federal panels of experts to review applications for such grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements. Requires that the application of any State rule or policy relating to the administration and operation of programs funded by the Act (including rules or policies based on State interpretations of Federal requirements) be identified as a State-imposed requirement. Adds provisions for review of grant or contract applications. Title II: Vocational Rehabilitation Services - Extends through FY 1991 the authorization of appropriations for grants to States (and Indian tribes) for provision of vocational rehabilitation services and for innovation and expansion of such services. Revises requirements for State plans for vocational rehabilitation services. Requires such plans to: (1) include the results of a comprehensive, State-wide assessment of the rehabilitation needs of all individuals with severe handicaps residing within the State and the State's response to the assessment; (2) describe the manner in which rehabilitation engineering services will be used to provide aid to individuals with the most severe handicaps; (3) contain provisions relating to the standards governing the qualified personnel used in the provision of vocational rehabilitation services; (4) provide for other services as are specified after a determination that comparable services and benefits are not available under any other program; (5) provide for cooperative agreements with community mental health programs; (6) provide that the State shall consult with Indian tribal organizations and native Hawaiian organizations in the development of such plans; (7) provide for public meetings and comments on the State plan; (8) contain plans, policies, and methods to be followed to assist in the transition from education to employment related activities; (9) provide for conducting a full needs assessment for serving individuals with severe handicaps; and (10) provide satisfactory assurances that the State has an acceptable plan for supported employment services for severely handicapped individuals. Revises provisions for individualized written rehabilitation programs. Requires each such program to: (1) be developed to achieve the vocational objective of the individual; (2) include, where appropriate, a statement of the specific rehabilitation engineering services to be provided; (3) include an assessment of the expected need for post-employment services; and (4) provide for a reassessment of the need for post-employment services prior to case closure and a statement, where appropriate for severely handicapped individuals, of how such services will be provided. Requires that the procedures for review of a decision by a rehabilitation counselor or coordinator on an individualized written rehabilitation program shall provide an opportunity for the submission of additional evidence and information. Requires the grounds for the decision to be included in the final decision. Requires a copy of the decision to be provided to the affected individuals. Authorizes State fair hearing boards to review certain determinations under the Act under specified conditions. Changes the scope of vocational rehabilitation services that must be provided under the Act to include: (1) evaluations of rehabilitation potential by personnel skilled in rehabilitation technology, where appropriate; (2) \"specific\" (rather than \"other\") postemployment services necessary to assist handicapped individuals to maintain their employment; and (3) rehabilitation engineering services designed to assist severely handicapped individuals to increase their functional abilities and potential for self-sufficiency. Extends the method for determining the non-Federal share for construction of a rehabilitation facility to Indian tribal organization programs. Sets certain time limits on the reallocation of State allotments. Requires that at least one quarter of one percent but not more than one percent of the basic State grant be reserved for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services. Revises provisions for payments to States and maintenance of effort by States. Reduces the amount which a State is eligible to receive for vocational rehabilitation services by any amount by which non-Federal expenditures under the State plan are less than the average of the total of such expenditures for the three preceding fiscal years. Authorizes the Commissioner to waive or modify such maintenance of effort requirements when exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affect a State. Revises provisions for the client assistance program. Permits the Governor of a State to remove an agency designated as a client assistance agency only for good cause.

Extends the duration of the program of grants to States for such assistance through FY 1991. Provides that the non-Federal share of costs for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services grants may be in cash or in kind. Authorizes the Commissioner to waive the non-Federal share requirement. Changes the requirements for a State's application for a grant for American Indian vocational rehabilitation programs. Requires such application to include assurances that the services provided may include services traditionally used by the tribal organization. Limits the duration of the application's effectiveness to 36 months. Requires the Secretary to give priority consideration to applications for the continuation of programs that have been funded in the past. Deletes the provision that sets forth the method of computing a State allotment for vocational rehabilitation services based upon the number of Indians living on a reservation in the State. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study on the special problems and needs of American Indians with handicaps both on and off the reservation (including an evaluation of the nature and extent of cooperative efforts between programs under this Act); and (2) submit the results of such study to the President and the appropriate committees of the Congress within 12 months of enactment of this Act. Title III: Research and Training - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1991 for the National Institute of Handicapped Research (the Institute) and for research grants for methods and devices to assist in the provision of vocational and rehabilitation services for handicapped individuals.
