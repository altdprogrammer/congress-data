Changes the present staggered terms of Board members to terms of four years, unless such members are reappointed. Changes the termination date of the Board from November 16, 1985 to November 16, 1988. Limits the annual salary of Board members to a specified amount. Allows, after calendar year 1986, an increase in such amount in proportion to the Consumer Price Index. Authorizes the Board to award scholarships to recipients of Congressional Award Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals. (Currently, scholarships are awarded only to recipients of gold medals.) Requires the Board to report the administrative expenditures of each member, officer, employee, and consultant in its annual report. Requires the Board to meet at least twice a year with at least one meeting in the District of Columbia. (Currently, the Board is required to meet once annually.) Requires the Board's bylaws and regulations to include provisions to prevent any conflict of interest in procurement and employment actions. Requires such bylaws to include appropriate fiscal control, funds accountability, and operating principles to ensure compliance with the general operating and expenditure authority of the Board. Requires that a copy of such bylaws be submitted to the Congress within 90 days of enactment of this Act, and not later than ten days after revisions. Authorizes the Board to permit donors to use its name or the name \"Congressional Award Program\" in advertising. Requires the General Accounting Office to audit and evaluate the Board at least biennially and report on the first audit after the enactment of this Act by May 15, 1988."
