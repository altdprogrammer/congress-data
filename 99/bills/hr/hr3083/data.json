Requires, for five years, the annual addition of at least 25 other hazardous substances. Directs the Administrator to prepare toxicological profiles for each substance listed which evaluate the information available and the need for additional research on a priority, 25 annual minimum basis. Requires the adequate staffing of the ATSDR to prepare such profiles. Permits an individual to petition the Administrator for a preliminary assessment of the environmental and public health hazards associated with the release of a particular substance. Requires the Administrator of the ATSDR to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if a substance's release may be dangerous so that such substance may be ranked. Directs the Administrator of ATSDR to conduct a health effects study on a hazardous substance where a preliminary assessment indicates its release may pose a threat to human health or upon petition by exposed individuals. Requires such study to be completed within nine months of the petition or assessment."
