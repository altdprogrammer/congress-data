Exempts the Secretary from the financial responsibility requirements. Prohibits the delegation to the Secretary of any response authority under such Act, requiring such authority to remain with the President or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as appropriate. Permits the designation of the Secretary and other Department of Defense (DOD) officials as natural resources trustees under such Act. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate other authorities to the Secretary or DOD officials if it would be cost-effective except the authority to approve remedial action at a site on the National Priorities List (NPL) in a nonemergency situation. Authorizes the President to issue response action orders as necessary to protect the national security. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Office of the Secretary an office to implement the Defense Environmental Restoration Program which includes investigating and cleaning up contamination from hazardous substances and correcting environmental damage. Directs the Secretary to carry out response actions with respect to releases of hazardous substances from sites and vessels under the Secretary's jurisdiction. Excludes response actions which do not result in a new facility from military construction requirements. Permits removal or remedial action by another responsible party. Directs the Secretary to pay all fees and charges imposed by State and local authorities for storage and/or disposal of hazardous substances on lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to implement the administrative abatement authorities where there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment from a DOD controlled facility. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 to carry out the restoration program. Makes available to the Secretary amounts recovered from responsible parties for response actions of the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to settle claims under CERCLA up to a specified amount. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 for emergency removal actions where the release or threatened release of any hazardous substance presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or environment. Limits the per-site expenditure unless the Secretary and the Administrator agree that continued response actions are required in an emergency-type situation. Requires each emergency removal action to be completed within six months if possible or within 18 months at the outside. Requires the Secretary to notify the Congress within 15 days of obligating emergency funds. Authorizes the Secretary to use facility maintenance funds for response actions, including emergency actions. Authorizes the Secretary to utilize the services of any other Government agency on a reimbursable basis to carry out this Act.

Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990. Directs the Secretary to notify the Administrator of the Agency of Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within one year of this Act's enactment of the 25 hazardous substances most frequently used at DOD facilities for which no standard or water quality criteria are in effect under the other Federal environmental and water quality statutes. Requires ATSDR to prepare profiles on such substances within one year of receiving the funds to do so. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to keep the regional EPA offices and the appropriate State and local authorities informed about any hazardous substance releases or proposed response actions occurring at a DOD site within their area. Requires that such notice be made prior to taking a response action in nonemergency situations. Directs the Secretary to establish a Technical Review Committee of such authorities whenever possible to review and comment on DOD proposals. Requires the Secretary to provide an opportunity for public participation before adopting a plan for remedial action at any DOD site on the NPL. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the implementation of this Act, including a statement for each site and its hazardous substances, the response actions taken or proposed, and the costs involved. Directs the Secretary to provide the Congress with information on military construction projects in the budget attributable to environmental restoration programs. Requires military construction authorizations to separately set forth the amount requested for environmental restoration for each military department and defense agency. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out otherwise unauthorized emergency construction for hazardous substance response actions up to a specified amount and after congressional notification."
