Title II: Milk Marketing Control - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide for suspension of the current milk price support program and implementation of an alternative program under which the percentage of the parity price of milk shall escalate by increments from 71 percent to 80 percent during the calendar years 1988 through 1997, and remain at 80 percent through 2000. Title III: Agricultural Exports and Imports - Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to direct the President to enter into multilateral agreements with other food exporting nations in order to fulfill the food aid requirements of needy nations. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to examine and report to the President about any imported articles that interfere with any program or operation undertaken by the Department of Agriculture. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require processed agricultural products to label any imported ingredients and their countries of origin. Title IV: Food Assistance - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to provide for increased food assistance benefits. Title V: Farm Debt Restructuring - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make farmer debt restructuring loans to any qualifying State under a specified program.
