    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-07-30", 
    "text": "Children's Survival Act - Title I: Programs for the Improvement of Foster Care - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to extend indefinitely: (1) the conditional ceiling on Federal financial participation in foster care; (2) the provision which permits a State to use, under part B (Child Welfare Services) of title IV, funds made available to it under the conditional ceiling that are not needed under part E; and (3) the provision permitting Federal financial participation for foster care for certain children voluntarily placed in foster care. Requires a State, under such part E, to: (1) make foster care maintenance payments to foster care children until they reach the age of 21, if they are students who are regularly attending a secondary school or a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit them for gainful employment; and (2) provide financial subsidies (independent living subsidies) to support youths aged 16 through 21, who are in substitute care under the supervision of a child welfare agency, in the transition to financial and social independence. Amends the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 to make permanent specified provisions which provide for Federal payments for certain dependent children voluntarily placed in foster care. Title II: Child Care Provisions - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act to provide that the amount of the payment to a State shall be equal to 75 percent of its expenditures for the provision of services directed at the goals set forth in such title, but may not exceed the amount of its allotment. Sets allotment amounts for FY 1985 through 1988 and each succeeding fiscal year. Reserves from the allotments set for FY 1986 through 1988 and each succeeding fiscal year specified amounts for: (1) a National Resource Center on Family Day Care; (2) human services personnel training; (3) child day-care services; (4) grants to States for upgrading or implementing their licensing, regulation, and monitoring of child day-care services to meet specified standards; and (5) provision of services (including human services personnel training and child day-care services) generally authorized under title XX. Provides that the National Resource Center on Family Day Care is to be operated on a regional basis, either directly or through grant or contract. Includes among Center functions: (1) training individuals involved in training family day care providers; (2) serving as a clearinghouse for resource materials; and (3) providing technical assistance with respect to relevant laws and regulations. Designates specified percentages of the funds reserved for use by States to provide human services personnel training for: (1) training providers, operators, and staffs of licensed or registered child care services and facilities, State licensing and enforcement officials, and parents; (2) making grants to community-based nonprofit organizations (meeting certain requirements) within a State to provide support services and assistance for family day-care providers. Requires that specified funds reserved for child day-care services be used by States only for the provision of such services to children: (1) who are, or are at risk of being, abused or neglected, and who are in families receiving child protective services; (2) of eligible families who are recipients of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC); and (3) of low-income adolescent parents, working parents, parents enrolled in education or training programs, and parents seeking employment. Sets forth conditions for State eligibility to receive specified funds reserved for assistance in meeting standards for licensing, regulation, and monitoring of child day-care services. Sets forth provisions for allotment of the various sorts of reserved funds under title XX. Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to add new chapter 3 provisions for school-based child care and early childhood education demonstration projects. (Redesignates the current chapter 3 provisions as chapter 4.) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990 for such projects in the public schools to increase the availability of child care and early childhood education services for children aged four and five, particularly those from low-income families. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to pay the Federal share of the cost of establishing and supplementing child care services and early childhood education for four and five-year-old children in the elementary and secondary schools of such LEA. Permits such child care services and early childhood education to include: (1) the extension of half-day kindergarten to meet the needs of working parents; (2) services for four-year-old children which shall be available for the full working day throughout the calendar year using public elementary or secondary school facilities; and (3) arrangements to furnish part-day care for children to complement half-day school-based kindergarten or early childhood education programs furnished in elementary schools. Allows LEAs receiving such assistance to enter into contracts for such services with public agencies and nonprofit private organizations which: (1) represent significant portions of the community to be served; and (2) have experience furnishing child care services. Sets forth provisions for grant applications and approval. Requires LEA applications to be reviewed by the appropriate State educational agency (SEA) before submission to the Secretary. Requires assurances that project participants will receive the services free of charge for children from families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level. Requires a sliding scale of fees dependent upon the family's income for other participants. Requires a description of measures which the LEA will take to encourage the equitable participation of handicapped and severely handicapped children in such projects. Requires projects to meet specified minimum standards and to encourage parent involvement in project design and operation. Requires specified assurances as to the non-Federal share of such project costs. Requires establishment of community advisory panels. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish objective criteria for application approval; (2) ensure adequate distribution of such grants; and (3) give preference to applications which propose projects serving a significant portion of children from low-income families and projects furnishing services for the entire workday. Allows such grants to be made for a period of five fiscal years, but requires annual reevaluation to ensure that project goals and objectives have been met. Directs the Secretary, upon finding that an LEA is not making progress toward meeting its project goals and objectives, to discontinue its grant, after notice and opportunity for a hearing. Limits the maximum Federal share of project costs to: (1) 75 percent in the first year; (2) 60 percent in the second year; and (3) 40 percent in the third, fourth, and fifth years. Sets forth annual reporting requirements for LEAs receiving such project grants. Directs the Secretary, by September 30, 1989, to report to the Congress and the President on the basis of such annual LEA reports and an independent evaluation of such projects. Limits the amount of funds which may be used for such evaluation. Sets forth the following provisions which may be cited as the \"Public Housing Child Care Demonstration Program Act.\" Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to: (1) make grants to public housing agencies to contract for lower-income housing project resident child care services; and (2) design such program to determine the extent to which it facilitates resident employability. Requires a report to the Congress on such program within three years after the enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1986 through 1988. Sets forth provisions for grants to States for scholarships for individuals pursuing child development associate credentials. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a grant for any fiscal year to any State receiving a grant under title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act to enable the State to award scholarships to eligible individuals within the State who are candidates for the Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. Defines \"eligible individual\" as a CDA candidate whose income does not exceed a specified poverty line by more than 50 percent. Sets forth requirements for State applications for such grants and for distribution of such grants throughout the Nation. Requires States receiving such grants to submit specified program information to the Secretary annually. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 and succeeding fiscal years. Title III: Child Health Programs - Amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant) of the Social Security Act to increase the amount authorized to be appropriated for FY 1986 for specified purposes under such title V. Provides that such sums as may be necessary for such purposes shall be authorized for each fiscal year after FY 1986. Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 for: (1) community health centers for primary care; and (2) migrant health centers. Repeals provisions relating to the primary care block grant program. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to make Medicaid assistance available if the individual's family income and resources do not exceed specified levels to: (1) medically verified pregnant women; (2) effective October 1, 1985, individuals under age six; and (3) effective October 1, 1986, individuals under age 18. Defines \"family,\" for such purposes. Provides that medical assistance for pregnant women under Medicaid shall include all of specified care and services without limitation on the amount, duration, or scope of necessary medical assistance, and without regard to whether such care and services are furnished in equal amount, duration, or scope to other individuals entitled to assistance under the State plan. Provides that, for purposes of eligibility for and extent of Medicaid assistance, the financial responsibility of an individual for the individual's child shall not be taken into account if such child is medically verified pregnant. Provides, for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility, for treating as incurred expenses the amount that would otherwise be charged by a provider, who is funded in whole or in part under title V (Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant) of the Social Security Act or under provisions for primary care community health centers or migrant health centers under the Public Health Service Act, for services rendered to pregnant women or to individuals under age 21, if such charge has been reduced or not imposed pursuant to specified provisions of such Acts. Title IV: Child Education Program - Amends Chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to authorize appropriations to carry out Chapter 1 for FY 1986 and 1987. Amends the Bilingual Education Act to specify the amounts which are authorized to be appropriated for FY 1986 through 1988 to carry out such act.
