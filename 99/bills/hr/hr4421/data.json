    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 99-815) Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 - Title I: The Head Start Program - Amends the Head Start Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1987 through 1990 to carry out the Head Start program. Revises the formula for the minimum funding guarantees for Indian and migrant Head Start programs. Extends through FY 1990 the family income calculation method used to determine eligibility for Head Start programs. Title II: Follow Through Program - Amends the Follow Through Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1987 through 1990 to carry out the Follow Through program. Repeals provisions which require notice and opportunity to show cause why suspensions of assistance or denials of refunding should not take place. Title III: The Dependent Care State Grant Program - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to authorize appropriations for FY 1987 through 1990 to make allotments to States for dependent care programs. Makes the inclusion of specified types of information in dependent care resource and referral systems optional rather than mandatory. Requires States to assure that: (1) no such information will be provided with respect to any dependent care services which do not comply with State and local laws; and (2) the information will be the latest available and kept up to date. Provides that certain funds may be used for school-age child care services before and after school in community centers whether or not school facilities are available for such purposes. Redefines \"school-age children\" to include those younger than five in States where such children are provided a free public education. Entitles such dependent care program provisions of such Act as the \"State Dependent Care Development Grants Act.\" Title IV: Community Services Block Grant Program - Amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to authorize FY 1987 through 1990 appropriations for the community services block grant program. Includes within the definition of eligible entities those programs which came into existence in FY 1982 as direct successors to community action agencies and meet specified board composition requirements. Establishes procedures which the Secretary of Health and Human Services must follow in reviewing State funding termination for a community action agency or migrant or seasonal farmworker organization. Directs the Secretary to assume responsibility for providing financial assistance if a State terminates funding prior to hearing and review. Requires: (1) grant evaluations to consider the impact of program funds on children, pregnant adolescents, homeless families, and the elderly poor; and (2) evaluation results to be submitted annually to appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes the Secretary to fund national conferences, newsletters, and information collection and dissemination as part of such grant programs's training activities. States that Community Development Corporations are to be governed by a board consisting of residents of the community and business and civic leaders. Requires that specified congressional committees are to be annually provided with summaries of final reports on projects assisted under the Secretary's discretionary authority, including a list of recipients who have received such assistance outside of the competitive process. Directs the Secretary to prepare and distribute a catalog listing information on the projects funded under such discretionary program. Revises provisions for the community food and nutrition programs to provide that 60 percent of program funds be allocated as grants on the basis of low-income and unemployed populations of States and 40 percent on a competitive basis. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1990 for community food and nutrition programs under the Act. Modifies interest rates payable on certain rural development loans. Revises provisions for assignment of certain loan contracts.
