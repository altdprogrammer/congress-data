Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1987 for increases in employee benefits, for payments to Panama, and for increased fuel costs. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to permit up to six additional individuals from Panama to receive instruction at the Merchant Marine Academy. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to insure that Panama will reimburse the Secretary for the cost of that instruction. Amends the Panama Canal Act of 1979 to exempt Panama Canal Commission appropriations from the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
