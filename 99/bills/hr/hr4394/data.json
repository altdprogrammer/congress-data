Requires such agreements to provide for the indemnification of persons against claims for public liability for nuclear incidents arising out of a contractual activity. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make certain indemnification payments out of the Nuclear Waste Fund; and (2) enter into specified borrowing terms with the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of paying nuclear liability claims. Provides for Federal indemnification of a precautionary State activity undertaken as a result of a federally contracted radioactive waste disposal incident. (Defines such a precautionary activity as any action to evacuate the public in order to protect the public health and safety from a real or imminent danger.) Applies the waiver of specified defenses to indemnity agreements entered into by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding radioactive waste to which the United States holds title."
