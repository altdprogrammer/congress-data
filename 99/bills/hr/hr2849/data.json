    "text": "Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to define \"motor fuel blending stock\" as any product derived primarily from petroleum, shale oil, or natural gas, whether or not containing additives, which is used for direct blending in the manufacture of motor fuel. Requires the U.S. International Trade Commission to estimate the aggregate quantity of gasoline and motor fuel blending stock that will annually enter the United States and to certify such estimates to the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service. Specifies the annual \"gallonage allotment\" into the United States for such products and provides an increased duty upon such products. Requires the Commissioner to deposit a specified percentage of the customs revenues collected under this Act into the Highway Trust Fund for the Mass Transit Account. Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to authorize appropriations (equal to 40 percent of the customs revenues collected under this Act) for the weatherization assistance program for low-income persons under the Act."
