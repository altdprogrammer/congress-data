    "text": "Fair Financial Aid for Part-Time Students Act - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to remove the requirement that a student must be carrying or planning to carry at least one-half the normal full-time workload for the student's course of study, for purposes of eligibility for title IV student assistance programs (i.e. Pell grants, supplemental educational opportunity grants, guaranteed, insured, or direct student loans, work-study and other assistance). Revises provisions for cost of attendance allowances, for purposes of need analysis for such eligibility for title IV student assistance programs. Provides that such cost of attendance allowance shall: (1) with respect to full-time students, be equal to room, board, books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses, as determined by the institution at which the student is in attendance; (2) with respect to less than full-time but more than half-time students, be an amount determined by the institution to be proportional to that for full-time students; and (3) with respect to less than half-time students, be limited to tuition and fees and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses as determined by the institution. Limits the cost of attendance allowance, for purposes of the Pell grant program, to $1,800 for students who are without dependents and who reside with their parents, and $2,600 for all other students, for academic year 1986-1987, with such limits to be increased by $100 in each succeeding academic year. Revises provisions for the minimum grant restriction under the Pell grant program. Retains the $200 minimum grant amount for full-time students, but sets the minimum amount at $100 for less than full-time but at least half-time students, and $50 for less than half-time students. Revises provisions for supplemental educational opportunity grants (SEOG) to remove minimum grant restrictions. Removes a limitation on the portion of its SEOG allocation which an institution may use for less than half-time students. Requires that a reasonable proportion of such allocation shall be made available to less than full-time students, if such allocation is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by such students. Revises provisions for work-study programs to remove a limitation on the portion of an institution's work-study grant which may be used for less than half-time students. Requires that a reasonable proportion of such grant shall be made available to less than full-time students, if such grant is based in part on the financial need demonstrated by such students. Revises provisions for direct student loans to require that a reasonable proportion of such loans made by an institution shall be made to less than full-time students, if the institution's Federal capital contribution is based in part on financial need demonstrated by such students. Revises the cost of attendance allowance for day care to provide for an allowance, to be determined by the institution, based on the actual (currently reasonable) expenses incurred for care of dependents (currently dependent children only) who require care in the student's absence. Declares that specified requirements relating to the availability of institutional and financial assistance information and guidance for students are applicable to both full-time and less than full-time students. Directs the Secretary of Education, notwithstanding any provision of the Student Financial Assistance Technical Amendments Act of 1982, to modify the regulations for determining expected family contribution and effective family income to comply with specified HEA requirements."
