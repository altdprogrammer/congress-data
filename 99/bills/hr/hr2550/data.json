Allows vessels which have been engaged in the domestic trade for two and one half years and which were built without a CDS to file a notice of harm (a notice that CDS-built vessels are harming such vessels to the point where they no longer can compete) with the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate the operation of the CDS-built vessel if the notice of harm is granted. Allows CDS-built vessels with three years of uninterrupted service in the domestic trade to operate permanently in the domestic trade if a proportionate share of CDS repayment is made."
