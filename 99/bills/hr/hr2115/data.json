Requires the President to notify the Congress within 21 days of what action, if any, the President will take against such foreign trade practices. Requires the President to submit an annual report to the Congress specifying with respect to foreign countries or instrumentalities with which the United States had a negative trade balance: (1) the extent to which such negative trade balance was attributable to unfair foreign trade practices; and (2) what actions were taken to eliminate such practices."
