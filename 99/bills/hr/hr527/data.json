    "text": "School District Consolidations Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Federal judicial code to prohibit Federal district courts from ordering the consolidation of two or more school districts in a desegregation case to which two or more school districts are parties unless: (1) the court has previously entered an order in the case which included all appropriate relief other than the consolidation of such school districts; (2) the previous order has been in effect for at least five years; and (3) the court determines that the previous order has failed to remedy the unlawful segregation of students. Prohibits U.S. district courts from ordering consolidation of school districts to achieve a particular racial balance of students. Provides that if an order to consolidate two or more school districts is entered, the court must determine the amount of expenses paid or incurred by any school district to accomplish consolidation and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the name of such school district and the amount of such expenses. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse the school district."
