    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-04-03", 
    "text": "Hazardous Waste Safety and Technology Incentive Act of 1985 - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) to require each State to develop and adopt a plan to assure the availability of adequate capacity to treat or dispose of all hazardous waste reasonably anticipated to be generated in such State during the next 20 years. Requires such plans to include timetables and schedules for the construction and operation of treatment and disposal facilities. Requires emissions standards for such facilities to conform with applicable State and Federal laws and to be sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Prohibits the construction or operation of new landfills. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of such plans within two years. Provides for resubmittal of rejected plans. Prohibits the expenditure of Superfund monies for remedial action after four years if a State is not in compliance with an Administrator-approved plan. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the issuance of a hazardous waste facility permit unless the owner or operator of the facility enters into a siting agreement with the Administrator specifying the terms and conditions applicable to such facility, including construction, maintenance, monitoring procedures, and a relationship with and financial obligation to the local government. Amends Superfund to direct the Administrator to establish a national research and development program to develop advanced technologies to reduce the risks associated with hazardous waste disposal. Sets forth the components of such program. Limits the amount of available appropriations which may be used. Directs the Administrator to establish a Coordinated Permit Review Office within each regional office of EPA to accelerate the concurrent review of all hazardous waste treatment or disposal facility projects requiring agency permits as they relate to the nation's air, water, and land. Directs such Office to: (1) assist in identifying the appropriate permits needed for a site; (2) convene meetings to determine the scope of and issues raised by a proposed project; and (3) assist the applicable government agencies in working with the applicant. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee loans for projects for the acquisition, construction, or installation of hazardous waste recycling or treatment equipment. Limits such loans to fixed percentages of total indebtedness or capital costs and restricts them to the private sector. Requires eligible projects to control emissions sufficiently to protect human health and the environment and meet applicable Federal and State air and water quality standards and conditions on land disposal. Makes landfill solutions ineligible for such guarantees. Grants priority to technologies which satisfy specified requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Requires recipients of such guarantees to report annually to the Administrator. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to at least five States for demonstration programs for ensuring and improving enforcement of the requirements of such Act. Requires such States to: (1) complete the program within the year; (2) have adequately trained personnel; (3) establish a Federally-compatible system for collecting data relating to the transportation of hazardous materials and enforcement actions; and (4) establish meaningful penalties for violations. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress and each participating State within two years. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, acting through the Office of State and Local Assistance for Hazardous Materials Emergencies, to: (1) provide technical and financial assistance to States and local governments and for regional planning for emergency preparedness relating to accidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials; (2) be an information clearinghouse on accident response methodology; and (3) coordinate Federal emergency response programs. Requires the Director to establish the Office of State and Local Assistance for Hazardous Waste Emergencies to carry out such requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
