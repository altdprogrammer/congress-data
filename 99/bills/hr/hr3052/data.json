Council to take effect on the date of such Act, or, if submitted to qualified D.C. voters for approval, to take effect on the date of such approval. Eliminates the requirement that at least one signature appearing on the face of general issue obligation bonds be manual (instead of a stamp or other facsimile). Authorizes to be appropriated to the District of Columbia as the annual Federal payment for FY 1987 and each fiscal year thereafter a sum equal to 35 percent of the total tax revenue of the general fund of the District of Columbia for such fiscal year."
