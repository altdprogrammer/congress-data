Rept. 99-267 (Part I)) Single-Employer Pension Plan Termination Insurance Premium Act of 1985 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to increase from $2.60 to $8.50 per capita the annual premium rate payable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the Corporation) by single-employer pension plans for plan years beginning after December 31, 1985. Makes a conforming amendment with respect to plan years after 1977. Makes technical amendments which incorporate certain former provisions instead of using cross-references. Requires that congressional approval of the Corporation's recommended revised premium schedules be by the enactment of a joint resolution. (Current law requires a concurrent resolution for such purpose.)"
