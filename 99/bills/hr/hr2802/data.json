Requires such program to: (1) focus on technologies with potential for use in remedial actions; (2) establish a central reference library to make information related to such technologies available to the public; and (3) provide for assistance to and participation by public and nonprofit entities in the evaluation of technologies. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to designate a national priority site in each of the EPA regions as a national technology demonstration site. Directs the Administrator to revise and republish the national contingency plan to include standards for the use of these technologies in remedial actions. Requires the President to include such technologies in any selection of cost-effective permanent solutions. Authorizes the use of funds from the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund (Superfund) for such research program. Requires the President to report to the Congress within one year of this Act's effective date on a study of the effects of the standards of liability and financial responsibility requirements imposed by CERCLA on the cost of and incentives for developing such technologies. Requires the President to submit to the Congress within 18 months of the national technology demonstration sites' designations an evaluation of the demonstration projects undertaken."
