    "text": "Ocean Dumping Amendments Act of 1985 - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit after December 31, 1986, the issuance of any permit for the dumping of municipal sludge unless: (1) the applicant is in compliance with all the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act pertaining to pretreatment standards for the introduction of pollutants into treatment works; and (2) there is not available any land-based alternative to the ocean disposal of the sludge. Makes it mandatory for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Secretary of the Army, as the case may be, to collect ocean dumping permit processing fees. Requires an additional special fee to be collected from applicants for ocean dumping permits to recoup the cost of undertaking activities directly associated with permits. Defines \"municipal sludge\" for purposes of such Act. Sets forth the congressional finding that the New York Bight Apex is no longer suitable for municipal sludge dumping. Requires applicants seeking permits to dump municipal sludge within the Apex to be eligible authorities. Prohibits the Administrator from issuing or renewing permits for the dumping of municipal sludge within the Apex either after 18 months from the date of enactment of this Act or after the first day the Administrator determines sludge can reasonably be dumped at a designated site outside the Apex, whichever date occurs first. Directs the Administrator to develop, after public hearings, and report to the Congress within three years on a New York Bight Apex Restoration Plan for improving the overall water quality and marine resources of the Apex. Sets forth various activities which must be covered by the plan. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress within six months a schedule for completing the plan and an estimate of the cost for developing and, where possible, implementing the plan. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress within one year on the economic and technical feasibility of establishing and implementing quality standards for the disposal of municipal sludge through ocean or land-based methods. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 to EPA for purposes of preparing the New York Bight Apex Restoration Plan. Imposes a special, per ton, disposal fee on permittees dumping municipal sludge into the ocean, the amount increasing with each fiscal year. Deposits 80 percent of such fee in a trust account, if the permittee establishes one, such money to be used only with the concurrence of the permittee and for the development of long-term alternatives to ocean dumping and for better treatment techniques. Requires the Administrator to use the remaining 20 percent and the unused funds in trust accounts for the comprehensive assessment of land-based disposal options and research. Directs the Administrator to prepare and report to the Congress within 18 months a comprehensive assessment of land-based disposal options for municipal sludge for permittees that are eligible authorities. Prohibits the ocean dumping of all harmful municipal sludge after 18 months of the date of enactment of this Act. Defines \"harmful municipal sludge\" as municipal sludge which fails to meet EPA's environmental impact criteria."
