    "text": "North Pacific Fur Seal Protection Act of 1985 - Title I: Termination of Convention - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Interim Convention on the Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals should not be continued. Declares that the President should terminate such Convention and enter into negotiations for an international agreement banning all killing of such seals. Title II: Protection of Seals - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Pribilof Wildlife Refuge. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to designate that part of the fishery conservation zone extending seaward of the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, as a marine sanctuary. Prohibits the taking of seals within such Refuge and marine sanctuary, unless by the natives for subsistence purposes. Sets forth sanctions for violations of these provisions. Directs the Secretaries to employ Pribilof Islands natives as rangers and guides. States that this title shall become effective upon termination of the Convention. Title III: Advisory Council; Social Services Programs - Provides for the establishment of an advisory council to study and recommend to the Congress alternative means of developing a livelihood for Pribilof Islands natives in lieu of the taking of seals upon the termination of the Convention. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to assure that the income of Pribilof Islands natives engaged in the taking of seals be maintained after the prohibition on the taking of seals takes effect. Title IV: Other Provisions of Law - Repeals title I (Conservation and Protection of North Pacific Fur Seals) of the Fur Seal Act of 1966. Stipulates that the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 shall not apply if the taking of seals is prohibited under this Act."
