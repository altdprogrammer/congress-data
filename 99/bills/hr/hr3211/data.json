Requires the program to develop and choose projects for demonstration at selected sites on the National Priorities List (NPL). Permits any person to apply to demonstrate innovative technology, each application to be reviewed within EPA. Directs the Administrator to establish a plan, based upon the applicant's demonstration plan, and evaluate the technology's effectiveness. Directs the Administrator to act upon applications according to a specified timetable. Authorizes the Administrator to provide loan guarantees for demonstration projects. Requires a minimum of five projects in FY 1986, increased to a minimum of ten per year during the succeeding four fiscal years. Directs the Administrator to revise and republish the National Contingency Plan (NCP) to include standards and testing procedures utilizing alternative or innovative technologies, according to cost-effectiveness. Requires the Administrator to document for the demonstrator how the technology concerned is considered for NPL site response actions. Authorizes appropriations from the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund (Superfund) for FY 1986 through 1990 to carry out this demonstration program."
