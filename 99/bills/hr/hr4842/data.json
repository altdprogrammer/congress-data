Bases such declaration on the need for allied cooperation to provide conventional and communications defenses and U.S. provision of strategic and common defense needs. Reduces each year from FY 1987 through 1991 the authorized end strength levels funding for U.S. troops stationed ashore in European member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and in nations other than NATO-member European nations. Authorizes a reduced end strength for each year to correspond with such reduced funding levels. Makes provisions of this Act inapplicable if the President exercises certain authority under the War Powers Resolution."
