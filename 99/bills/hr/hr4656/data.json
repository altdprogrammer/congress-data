    "text": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to allow a party that suffers economic loss by reason of the importation and sale of dumped merchandise (products sold in the United States at less than fair value) to bring an action for damages in a U.S. district court against: (1) a manufacturer of dumped merchandise; (2) an exporter of dumped merchandise to the United States; and (3) an importer of such merchandise to the United States. Grants to U.S. district courts jurisdiction over such manufacturers, exporters, and importers. Sets forth the method of calculation of damages to an injured party. Sets forth a two-year statute of limitations on the commencement of such actions. Requires certification by the administering authority to the International Trade Commission of the names of foreign persons who have three dumping determinations against them. Requires the Commission, upon such certification, to issue an order to prohibit for five years the importation by such foreign persons of dumped merchandise. Provides exceptions and modifications to such orders. Requires the administering authority to monitor the importation of products into the United States that are produced by persons who have two dumping determinations against them. Requires foreign persons that produce merchandise to which two or more dumping findings would have applied before the enactment of this Act to be treated as a manufacturer against whom two dumping determinations have been found."
