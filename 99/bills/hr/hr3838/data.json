Requires that if: (1) the employee excluded the distribution form income on account of a rollover; (2) the employee returns to service with the employer before incurring five consecutive one-year breaks in service; and (3) the vested percentage of benefits accrued before the separation from service is increased, then any subsequent distributions to the employee from the plan in which the subsequent distributions to the employee from the plan in which the increased vesting occurs are not eligible for the ten-year income averaging or capital gains treatment.
