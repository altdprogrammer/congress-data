Requires such fingerprints to be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States for a criminal history records check. Authorizes the Attorney General to provide the results of such check to persons designated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Authorizes such Commission to waive by rule such fingerprinting requirement under certain conditions. Directs such Commission to prescribe regulations for: (1) fingerprinting procedures; (2) the conditions under which information received from the Attorney General may be used; (3) limiting the redissemination of such information; and (4) providing individuals subject to fingerprinting complete information contained in the criminal history records prior to any final adverse action."
