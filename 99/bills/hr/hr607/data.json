Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress before March 16, 1988, on the effectiveness of such awards program, and on the continuation and, if appropriate, modification of the program. Repeals provisions for the periodic review of agency cash awards by the Comptroller General. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, to make cash awards to members of the armed forces for disclosures contributing to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of operations or programs of the armed forces."
