Requires that the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry give priority, in determining sites for health assessments, to those facilities or sites at which there is documented evidence of release of hazardous constituents, and reasonable cause to believe there has been such a release. Provides that where the health assessment discloses the exposure of a population to the release of a hazardous substance, the cost of such health assessment may be recovered from persons responsible for such release of such hazardous substances."
