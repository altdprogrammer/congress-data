Provides that such centers shall enable educational institutions in the region to share resources and improve and expand instruction in mathematics, science, foreign languages, vocational education, continuing education, and basic and remedial education skills. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Title II: Training for Industrial Competitiveness - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for FY 1987 and succeeding fiscal years, to fund programs added by this Act to the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Allocates such funds as follows: (1) 60 percent for trade-impacted worker assistance programs; (2) 20 percent for joint labor-management training programs; (3) nine percent for demonstration programs (for FY 1987 and 1988 only); (4) ten percent for State job bank systems (for FY 1987 through 1990 only); and (5) one percent for certain studies under this Act. Reallocates such funds after the FY 1987 and 1988 limited purposes are completed. Amends title IV (Federally Administered Programs) of the JTPA to add a new part H: Training for Industrial Competitiveness. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary, for purposes of this title) to: (1) provide training and employment assistance to trade-impacted workers; (2) provide financial and technical assistance to labor-management committees; and (3) establish demonstration programs to improve worker adjustment to changing world markets. Sets forth requirements for trade-impacted worker assistance programs.

Requires that such services shall: (1) be in addition to, and coordinated with, those provided under title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers) of JTPA; and (2) supplement and not supplant any other federally assisted training assistance or services. Includes specified considerations under criteria for determining if an industry has been adversely affected by international trade.

Directs the Secretary, within six months after enactment of this Act, to establish programs to demonstrate the feasibility of providing worker retraining payments to workers who: (1) are or were employed in an industry determined to have been adversely affected by international trade; and (2) meet specified criteria for dislocated workers. Limits such payments to $4,000 each, to enable such workers to purchase their own job search, education, training, and retraining services from certified providers. Sets forth program evaluation requirements. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on such programs. Adds to JTPA new provisions for State job bank systems. Directs the Secretary to make funds from this Act available through the U.S. Employment Service for the development and implementation of computerized job bank systems in each State, for purposes such as: (1) identification of, and referral to, job openings; (2) information on occupational supply and demand; and (3) use by career information, including school counseling, programs. Encourages compatibility of such systems with other systems used in employment and training program administration. Requires special consideration to be given to the advice of State occupational coordinating committees and other users of such systems. Directs the Secretary, within six months after enactment of this Act, to commence a study of the feasibility of providing portability for pensions and health benefits for dislocated workers. Requires such study to also evaluate the benefits of providing early retirement benefits without penalty for older dislocated workers. Requires a report of such study to be submitted to the Congress within 18 months after enactment of this Act. Includes among the data which the Secretary is required to maintain under JTPA data on the mass layoffs or closings that are caused by or substantially related to international trade. Directs the Secretary, under JTPA and in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, to develop statistical data relating to the permanent dislocation of farmers and ranchers due to farm and ranch failures, including those caused by or substantially related to international trade. Directs the Secretary to publish an annual report on such data, including an analysis of whether farmers and ranchers are being adequately counted in the annual employment and unemployment rates. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to conduct a study to identify the countries that fail to recognize and enforce, and the foreign producers that fail to comply with, internationally recognized labor rights. Requires an annual report of such study to be submitted to the Congress."
