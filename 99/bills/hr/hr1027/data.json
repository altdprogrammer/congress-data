Limits the Secretary's regulation of species not designated as threatened or endangered but similar in appearance to species which have been so designated, to the regulation of commerce or taking. States that the permissable incidental taking of endangered or threatened species by a Federal agency includes marine mammals and does not violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Extends the authorization of appropriations to carry out such Act through FY 1988. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and implement a plan to relocate and manage an experimental population of California sea otters, subject to specified requirements with respect to location, number, age, and sex of members of the population and the manner of capture, transport, and release."
