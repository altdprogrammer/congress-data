    "text": "Children's Options for Intensive Compensatory Education Act of 1986 - Amends Chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to revise provisions for authorized chapter 1 programs to allow issuance of educational vouchers as well as direct provision of special instructional and instructional support services. (Includes the acquisition of equipment, but not the construction of school facilities, among such services.) Authorizes local educational agencies (LEAs) to use Chapter 1 funds only for provision of a three-year program of such services to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived children in public and private schools who are identified in accordance with specified written criteria established by the State educational agency (SEA). Revises provisions for approval of applications to include identification of educationally deprived children with the greatest need of services to participate in a three-year program of services. Requires individualized instructional plans for each child selected. Requires parental involvement in such plans. Requires concentration of Chapter 1 services. Directs LEAs to limit the number of educationally deprived children selected for participation so as to ensure that the Chapter 1 services are of sufficient scope and quality to give reasonable promise of substantial progress toward meeting all of the special educational needs of each participating child during the three-year period of participation. Sets forth provisions for withdrawal and replacement of participating children, appointment of surrogate parents, maintenance of instructional effort, and providing of information to parents. Sets forth provisions under which the Secretary of Education may bypass LEAs in the provision of Chapter 1 services to private schools. Sets forth provisions for educational vouchers to be provided to parents by an LEA when the individualized instruction plan requires the provision of services by another LEA or by a private school. Sets forth nondiscrimination requirements which participating private schools must meet. Requires SEAs to conduct periodic compliance reviews of such private schools. Extends the duration of assistance for Chapter 1 grants to State educational agencies through FY 1993."
