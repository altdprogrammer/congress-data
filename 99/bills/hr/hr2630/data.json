    "text": "Consumer Product Safety Amendments of 1985 - Title I: Authorizations of Appropriations - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988. Title II: Consumer Product Safety Commission - Reduces the number of Commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission from five to three. Provides that only two (formerly three) Commissioners may be affiliated with the same political party. Reduces the number needed for a quorum from three to two. Requires the Commission to employ no fewer than the full-time equivalent of 568 officers and employees. Consolidates the District of Columbia and Maryland offices of the Commission in one location. Title III: General Provisions Respecting Commission Activities - Requires the Commission to take specified steps to assure the accuracy of publicly disclosed information which reflects adversely upon the safety of a consumer product. Permits the Commission to publish reports summarizing: (1) all judgments, decrees, and court orders; (2) remedial settlement agreements; and (3) voluntary recalls. Authorizes the Commission to assess civil penalties in an administrative action. Provides for judicial review of an assessment order. Repeals the Cellulose Insulation Safety Standard. Repeals the safety standard for swimming pool slides issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Requires Commission rules to be submitted to the Congress for review. Provides that the Congress may disapprove such a rule by enacting a joint resolution within 90 days. Title IV: Amusement Park Rides - Applies the provisions of such Act to amusement rides which are not permanently fixed to a site. Declares that an amusement ride which is permanently fixed to a site is not a consumer product for the purposes of promulgating safety standards or bans regarding such rides. Permits the Commission to release information from which the public can readily ascertain the identity of the amusement ride manufacturer or owner-operator. Requires immediate notification of the Commission if any amusement ride operator obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that the amusement ride the operator owns contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard. Authorizes the Commission to order the repair, replacement, or refund of purchase price if it determines that an amusement ride presents a substantial product hazard and the corrective action is in the public interest. Permits the Commission to make inspections with respect to amusement rides which are: (1) not permanently fixed to a site; (2) permanently fixed to a site if the State in which the inspection would occur does not require periodic inspections; or (3) involved in an accident resulting in a fatality or personal injury requiring hospitalization. Requires that such inspections be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. Title V: Effective Date - Provides the effective date of this Act."
