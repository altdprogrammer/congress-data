    "date": "1985-03-06", 
    "text": "Coastal Zone Management Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to reduce the percentage of costs covered in administrative grants to States for coastal resources management programs by implementing an annual reduction through FY 1988. Revises provisions dealing with Federal consistency with approved State management programs. Limits the use of funds from the Coastal Energy Impact Fund to the payment of obligations incurred before October 1, 1985. (Currently, there is no fiscal year limitation.) Establishes the National Estuarine Sanctuary Research System (the System). Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate an estuarine area as a national estuarine research sanctuary upon certain findings. Requires the Secretary to develop guidelines for the carrying out of research within the System. Requires the Secretary to promote and coordinate the utilization of such sanctuaries. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to coastal States for acquisition or operation of such sanctuaries or to a coastal State or other entity to support research and monitoring within a sanctuary. Sets per-sanctuary grant limits. Directs the Secretary to periodically evaluate the operation and management of each sanctuary and its research. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend a sanctuary from eligibility for financial assistance or withdraw its designation as a national sanctuary upon certain findings. Requires an annual report, beginning with FY 1986, by the Secretary to the Congress concerning such sanctuaries. Repeals Federal provisions which established: (1) research and technical assistance grants for coastal zone management; and (2) the Coastal Zone Management Advisory Committee and certain other positions. Adjusts the authorization of appropriations for administrative grants to States for coastal resources management programs and for the establishment of national estuarine sanctuaries."
