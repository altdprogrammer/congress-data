    "text": "Youth Camp Safety Act - Establishes in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services an Office of Youth Camp Safety to be headed by a Director of Youth Camp Safety. Confers upon the Director the primary responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of Federal and State youth camp safety regulations. Provides for congressional disapproval of such proposed regulations. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and modification of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Director for approval. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in the U.S. court of appeals. Authorizes the Director to make grants to States for the development of youth camp safety plans, such grants not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of carrying out the State plan. Authorizes the Director to enter and inspect youth camps and their records. Charges the Director with: (1) establishing within the Department of Health and Human Services an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety; and (2) reporting to the Congress and the President annually. Establishes judicial procedures to restrain any condition or practice which poses an imminent danger of serious injury at such camps. Prescribes penalties for violations by youth camp operators of the standards promulgated pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1986 through 1990."
