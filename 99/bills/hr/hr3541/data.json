    "text": "Minor Criminal Amendments Act of 1985 - Amends the Federal criminal code to revise requirements for pre-trial detention to authorize a pre-trial detention hearing, upon motion by the Government, if: (1) the defendant is accused of the unlawful possession or transfer of explosives or firearms violations, or (2) the defendant has been convicted of two or more specified types of crimes regardless of whether the offense charged was committed before or after the two convictions. Authorizes the court to reopen a detention hearing if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known at the time of hearing and has a material bearing on the issue of whether there are reasonable conditions of release. Authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of United States Courts to contract with appropriate public or private agencies or persons for the detection of, and care in the community of, offenders who are addicts or drug-dependent persons. Abolishes the United States Parole Commission effective at the close of September 30, 1991. Specifies that the Parole Commission shall have no jurisdiction over an offender who is sentenced, who violates a condition of parole, or who is transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States after May 31, 1991. Prohibits the Parole Commission from revising guidelines in effect as of March 31, 1991. Requires the Parole Commission, by May 15, 1991, to set a presumptive release date in accord with applicable guidelines for each prisoner who will be in its jurisdiction on September 30, 1991. Authorizes the Bureau of Prisons, after the termination date of the Parole Commission and in accord with Parole Commission regulations in effect on March 31, 1991, to adjust the release date and impose or modify conditions of release for a prisoner who was in the jurisdiction of the Parole Commission on September 30, 1991. Allows the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to prescribe regulations. Requires that such regulations must provide the same substantive rights to prisoners as were provided under Parole Commission regulations in effect on March 31, 1991. Requires the court which imposes sentence on a defendant to set a presumptive release date and the conditions of release in accord with applicable parole guidelines in effect on March 31, 1991, in the case of: (1) a defendant sentenced after March 31, 1991; or (2) any other defendant for whom the Parole Commission has not on or before May 15, 1991, set a presumptive release date. Authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to adjust the release date and modify the conditions of release in accord with regulations prescribed by the Bureau. Revises the definition of \"prison\" for purposes of the prohibition against rioting and other specified crimes in a prison to include a Federal detention facility. Includes ammunition, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and pencyclidine (PCP) as prohibited contraband in a Federal prison. Provides that State probationers or parolees who are provided protection under the Federal witness protection program shall be subject to all Federal laws pertaining to probationers in addition to all Federal laws pertaining to parolees. Includes probationers and parolees under Federal supervision as the result of a Federal conviction within the requirement that a probationer or parolee must comply with the memorandum of understanding entered into regarding his protection. Provides that the revocation of probation or parole because of the failure to comply with such a memorandum of understanding shall be discretionary. Authorizes the United States Marshals Service to credit to its appropriation account all fees, commissions, and expenses collected for: (1) the service of civil process; and (2) seizures, levies, and sales associated with judicial orders of execution. Amends the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act to limit the participation of the United States with regard to such agreement to that of a sending State."
