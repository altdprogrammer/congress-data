    "text": "Military Family Services Act of 1985 - Implements a rate of 18 cents per mile as reimbursement allowances for travel and transportation expenses related to military service. Implements a weight allowance scale by pay grade for military moves. Limits temporary lodging expenses reimbursement to: (1) enlisted members only; and (2) $100 per day (currently $110). Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish voluntary enrollment premium-sharing dental benefit plans for spouses and children of members of the uniformed services who are on active duty for more than 30 days. Requires enrolled members to pay a premium established by the Secretary. Outlines coverage limits for such plan. Creates a separate variable housing allowance for enlisted members of the uniformed services. (Currently, such allowance is the same for enlisted as well as non-enlisted members.) Authorizes the Secretary of each military department to enter into agreements with lessors having rental housing units located near military installations to assure compensation to such lessors for a breach of a lease by members of the armed forces. Outlines details to be included in such agreement. Provides for reimbursement to the United States by a member if it is determined that damage to the unit or breach of the lease was caused by the member. Provides for deductions from a member's pay in such circumstances. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress concerning such lease assurance agreements. Establishes in the Department of Defense the Office of Military Family Services to provide family services to the members of the armed services. Outlines the services to be provided. Requires the Director of such Office to report to the Secretary of Defense every 12 months following the date of enactment of this Act concerning issues related to military families."
