    "text": "Education for Economic Security Act Amendments of 1985 - Amends the Education for Economic Security Act (the Act) to reduce the amount authorized to be appropriated for FY 1985 for the program of grants to States and discretionary grants by the Secretary of Education for strengthening instruction and teacher skills in mathematics, science, computer learning, and foreign languages under title II (Education for Economic Security) of the Act. Extends through FY 1986 the authorization of appropriations for such programs. Revises the formulas for determining allotments to States and the amount of funds which may be reserved for discretionary grants by the Secretary under such program. Revises the distribution formula to be used by State educational agencies (SEAs) in allocating funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) under such program. Grants a SEA the option, in calculating relative enrollments for such purposes, to use (in addition to the number of children enrolled in public schools) either: (1) the number of children in private nonprofit schools; or (2) the number of children in private nonprofit schools desiring that their children and teachers participate in programs or projects assisted under title II of the Act. Provides that granting this option to the SEA shall not diminish the responsibility of LEAs to contact, on an annual basis, appropriate officials from private nonprofit schools within their school districts in order to determine whether such schools desire that their children and teachers participate in such programs and projects. Revises other title II program provisions for grants by State higher education agencies to institutions of higher education to retrain teachers who specialize in other disciplines. Adds foreign languages as one of the fields for which teachers with other specialities may retrain (in addition to mathematics, science, and computer learning). Revises State and local assessment and State application provisions to make miscellaneous, technical, and conforming amendments. Revises requirements relating to participation of children and teachers from private schools in programs under title II of the Act. Provides that, to satisfy such requirements, an SEA, LEA, State agency for higher eudcation or institution for higher education must: (1) first consult with appropriate private nonprofit school representatives; and (2) then provide, as appropriate, services and arrangements which benefit the students enrolled in private, nonprofit elementary and secondary schools and teacher training, inservice training, and retraining which benefit the teachers in such schools. Revises provisions for the Secretary's discretionary funds for programs of national significance to conform such provisions to the revised formulas for determining the amount of such reserved funds (as noted above). Makes other miscellaneous, technical, and conforming amendments to title II of the Act. Repeals specified provisions of the General Education Provisions Act which relate to the control of paperwork and under which the Federal Education Data Acquisition Council was established."
