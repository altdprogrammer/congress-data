    "text": "Free Trade in Ideas Foreign Affairs Amendments of 1985 - Prohibits denying, revoking, or limiting a passport because of any speech, activity, belief, affiliation, or membership which, if held or conducted within the United States, would be protected by the first amendment. Prohibits denying, revoking, or limiting a passport except to the extent necessary to prevent conduct not described in the preceding sentence. Amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act to declare that the authority granted the President under such Acts does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit: (1) any transactions ordinarily incident to travel to and from any country; (2) any transactions ordinarily incident to travel and maintenance within any country; (3) any transactions on behalf of aircraft or vessels incident to nonscheduled flights or voyages to and from any country; (4) normal banking transactions incident to travel to and from any country; or (5) any transactions ordinarily incident to the importation of publications or other informational materials from any country. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to require decisions on issuing export licenses to take into account the U.S. policy of sustaining vigorous scientific enterprise and respecting the ability of scientists and other scholars to communicate their research findings. Provides that Federal agencies, in carrying out a specified agreement on educational, scientific, and cultural exchanges, may not consider visual or auditory material as failing to qualify as international education material simply because it advocates a particular position so long as it is sufficiently fair as to permit an individual or the public to form an independent opinion or conclusion."
