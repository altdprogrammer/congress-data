    "text": "Joint Officer Capability Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a secondary occupational specialty for officers in each branch of the armed forces, to be known as the joint subspecialty. Outlines provisions concerning the number, selection, and assignments of officers to joint subspecialties. Directs the Secretary to establish career guidelines for officers in the joint subspecialty. Directs the Secretary to revise the curriculum of schools of the National Defense University in order to enhance the education and training of officers in joint military matters. Requires officers graduating from a joint military school in a joint subspecialty to be assigned to a joint position in that officer's next duty assignment. Prohibits an officer from commanding a unified or specified combatant command unless such officer is in a joint subspecialty. Prohibits an officer from appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) unless the officer has served as the commander of a unified or specified command. Sets forth the promotion policy for joint service officers (including faster promotions). Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for monitoring the careers of officers in the joint subspecialty or other joint officers. Revises provisions concerning the review of promotion lists by the Chairman of JCS to allow the Chairman, in a limited number of instances, to recommend for promotion officers who: (1) have served in joint assignments; and (2) were considered by a review board but not recommended for promotion. Allows the Secretary of the military department concerned to disagree with the Chairman's promotion recommendations. Requires the Secretaries concerned to record their disagreement as part of their transmittal to the Secretary of Defense of the selection board's report. Requires the Secretary of Defense to resolve any such disagreements before transmitting the report to the President. Requires previous joint officer assignments for officers promoted to brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half). Authorizes the Secretary to waive such prerequisite in appropriate cases. Outlines the length of duty as a joint officer required for promotion to certain grades. Requires the Chairman of JCS to advise the Secretaries of the military departments concerned with respect to duty assignments of officers in the joint subspecialty and other joint officers. Requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that military schools strengthen the focus on joint military operations in preparing certain level officers for joint duty assignments. Directs the Secretary of Defense to make the initial selection of officers for the joint subspecialty, following certain special rules."
