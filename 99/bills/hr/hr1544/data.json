Changes the provision dealing with the National Aquaculture Development Plan to give the lead responsibility for such Plan to the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and analyze information relating to aquaculture. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) establish a National Aquaculture Information Center within the Department of Agriculture; (2) arrange with foreign nations for the exchange of information relating to aquaculture and support a translation service; and (3) study and report to the Congress on the extent to which the U.S. aquaculture industry has access to relevant Federal programs which assist the agricultural sector. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to the Congress on whether existing capture fisheries could be adversely affected by competition from products produced by commercial aquacultural enterprises. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to study and report to the Congress on the exotic species introduced into U.S. waters as a result of aquaculture activities and on the potential benefits and impacts of the introduction of exotic species. Requires the Secretaries to preserve the confidentiality of any production information submitted in connection with their information collection activities. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare the biennial reports to the Congress on the status of aquaculture in the United States. Requires the first such report to be submitted by February 1, 1987. Designates the Secretary of Agriculture as the permanent chairman of the interagency aquaculture coordinating group established within the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Interior for FY 1986 through 1988 to carry out the National Aquaculture Act of 1980."
