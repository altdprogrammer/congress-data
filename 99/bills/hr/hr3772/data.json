Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1986 through 1990. Provides for the establishment of an advisory board that will assist the Administrator of AID in administering such assistance. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the European Economic Community should also provide economic assistance to Northern Ireland once a political solution is developed."
