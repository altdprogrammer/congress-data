Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the National Housing Act to allow the appropriate Federal regulatory agency to extend the period for disapproving a change in control of a federally-insured bank or savings and loan association beyond 90 days if additional time is needed to assure that all persons involved will comply with such recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Makes the proceeds of monetary instruments and depository institution accounts forfeited to, or seized by, the United States for an unlawful act available to the Secretary to enforce such requirements."
