    "text": "United States-Mexico Border Revitalization Act - Title I: United States-Mexico Free Trade and Co-Production Zone - United States-Mexico Free Trade and Co-Production Zone Act - Directs the President, during the five years after enactment of this title, to negotiate an agreement with Mexico for the establishment of a Free-Trade and Co-Production Zone, extending 200 miles into each country, in order to support and accelerate the economic development of that zone. Provides that the agreement may allow appropriate adjustments to the zone's inner boundaries. Requires that the agreement provide eligible ventures (legal entities operating within the Mexican or U.S. Zone Sector, the controlling interest of which is owned by citizens of the zone country, but of which citizens of the cooperating zone country own at least 35 percent) with specified tariff advantages and tax incentives. States that such an agreement shall not enter into force until the President submits the implementing bill and other related information to the Congress and the bill is enacted into law. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to expedite the bill's passage through the Congress. Directs the President, after a zone agreement is negotiated, to negotiate an agreement establishing a United States-Mexico free trade area. Sets forth negotiating guidelines. Requires the President to submit an annual report to the Congress detailing the progress of the zone negotiations or, if the zone has been established, to report on its effectiveness and subsequent free trade area negotiations. Title II: United States-Mexico Bilateral Commission - Authorizes the President to enter into an agreement with Mexico providing for the establishment of an equally representative bilateral commission (commission) whose purpose shall be to strengthen the ties between the United States and Mexico. Sets forth the duties of the commission, including discussing and making recommendations regarding: (1) the legal and illegal immigration of Mexican citizens to the United States; (2) the United States-Mexico Free Trade and Co-Production Zone; (3) the industrialization of the U.S. and Mexican Zone Sectors as a means of creating new jobs; and (4) tariff and trade issues. Specifies the make-up of the U.S. delegation. Provides remuneration only for related travel and subsistence expenses. Requires an annual report and a cumulative report (every four years) to the Congress detailing the commission's activities. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: United States-Mexico Joint Development Bank - United States-Mexico Joint Development Bank Act - Authorizes the President to enter into an agreement with Mexico to establish a United States-Mexico Joint Development Bank (the Bank) to make economic development loans in Mexico and in the border region of the United States. Sets forth information that shall be included in the agreement, including the requirements that: (1) assistance provided by the Bank shall be directed at improving employment opportunities and enhancing the economic development of the geographic and economic sectors of Mexico which are the major sources of undocumented Mexican nationals who enter the United States; and (2) the United States and Mexico contribute equally to the Bank. Directs the President to appoint the U.S. Directors of the Bank. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the United States entering into an agreement with Mexico to establish the Bank, to subscribe to the capital stock of the Bank. Authorizes appropriations to pay for such subscription. Requires reports with respect to the operation of the Bank to be included in the first report of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems transmitted after the United States accepts participation in the Bank. Prohibits any person or agency on behalf of the United States, unless authorized by Congress, from: (1) agreeing to an increase in the U.S. subscription to the Bank; (2) agreeing to an agreement which increases U.S. obligations or which would change the Bank's purpose or functions; or (3) providing financing to the Bank. Provides for Federal Reserve Banks to serve as depository banks for the Bank. Provides for suits against the Bank. Exempts the Bank from taxation. Title IV: Multilateral Commission on Immigration - Authorizes the President to enter into an agreement with nations in Latin America which are prime senders of emigrants to the United States to establish a multilateral commission on immigration equally representative of each participating nation. Requires the commission to discuss, and make recommendations regarding, the issues concerning legal and illegal immigration. Requires U.S. representatives to be appointed by the President. Provides remuneration only for related travel and subsistence expenses. Requires an annual report and a cumulative report (every four years) to the Congress detailing the commission's activities. Authorizes appropriations."
