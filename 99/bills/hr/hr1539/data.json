Makes up to 50 percent of such crop eligible for advance payments. Permits loan conversion to nonrecourse status upon harvest and availability as loan collateral. Administers such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation and the local farmer committees. Requires a participating producer to: (1) obtain crop insurance if available; and (2) use his crop as loan collateral. Limits loans to any single person to $200,000."
