Defines \"foreign base manufacturing related income\" as any income derived from the sale of property by a controlled foreign corporation where the property sold was manufactured in any country other than the United States in either a tax holiday plant or in a runaway plant. Defines \"tax holiday plant\" and \"runaway plant.\" Establishes in the Treasury the Economic Assistance Trust Fund (Trust Fund). Transfers to such Trust Fund 25 percent of the revenues raised due to taxes imposed on such foreign base company manufacturing related income. Authorizes expenditures from such Trust Fund for providing economic assistance in economically depressed areas. Provides that the remaining 75 percent of such revenues shall be used to reduce the public debt."
