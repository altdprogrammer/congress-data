Requires that funds made available to a grant recipient under this Act be used to provide a program of adult literacy training which includes as a major component involving parents and children together to enhance the likelihood of educational achievement. Requires that each such program receiving a grant include the following elements: (1) identifying and recruiting eligible participants; (2) screening and preparing parents and children for participation (including testing, referral to necessary counseling, and related services); (3) designing programs and providing support services to suit the participants' work and other responsibilities (including child care, transportation, and scheduling and locating services to allow joint participation by parents and children); (4) establishing instruction programs that promote adult literacy, equip parents to support the education and growth of their children, and prepare children for success in regular school program; and (5) providing and monitoring integrated instructional services to participants through home-based programs. Makes eligible for participation in such programs families that: (1) include a parent eligible to participate in an adult basic education program under the Adult Education Act; and (2) reside, with a child aged four or five, in a school attendance area designated for receipt of funds under chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA). Makes eligible to apply for such program grants any agency, organization, or institution that operates an adult basic education program under the Adult Education Act and that serves an area: (1) in which the unemployment rate exceeds the national average; and (2) at least 75 percent of which is comprised of school attendance areas designated for receipt of funds under chapter 1 of ECIA.
