    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1985-04-02", 
    "text": "National Lottery Act - Establishes a National Lottery Commission (the Commission) to establish and administer a national lottery program. Specifies dates by which ticket sales for the first lottery must begin, and by which the last lottery drawing must occur. Prescribes guidelines under which the Commission is directed to issue regulations for lottery administration. States that lottery tickets shall be sold only by Postal Service employees at U.S. post offices, unless the Commission provides otherwise by regulations. Directs the Commission to provide an application procedure for any persons seeking authority to sell lottery tickets. Prohibits the sale of lottery tickets to persons under 18 years of age. Directs the Commission to design a lottery program which assures that in any fiscal year the costs of prizes and administration do not exceed 45 percent of lottery revenues. Requires that: (1) lottery revenues be used for lottery prizes and administration; (2) 50 percent of the remainder of such revenues be deposited into the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; and (3) the remaining 50 percent be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury to reduce the Federal deficit. Prescribes guidelines for the appointment of Commission members, and for their terms of office. Includes the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services among Commission members. Sets guidelines for Commission meetings and staff organization. Requires the Commission to report to the President and the Congress on an annual basis until its termination on June 30, 1993. Treats lottery prizes as taxable income. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) report annually to the Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the transfer of appropriated funds from the general fund of the Treasury into the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; and (2) report annually to the Congress regarding the amount of Federal deficit reduction effected under the lottery program. Exempts any lottery conducted under the National Lottery Act from Federal criminal provisions regarding lotteries. Imposes criminal penalties (including fines and imprisonment) for specified violations of this Act. Exempts lotteries conducted under this Act from the Federal proscription against the use of the U.S. mail system for lottery-related purposes. Declares lottery ticket sales under this Act to be a Federal function for the purpose of raising revenue, thereby pre-empting State and local laws regarding such sales. Amends the Social Security Act regarding deposit of lottery revenues in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund."
