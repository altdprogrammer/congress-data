Requires each distributor who receives such certified gasoline and distributes it to certain persons to certify the type and percentage of alcohol and cosolvent in the gasoline according to specified guidelines. Requires each gasoline retailer of alcohol-blended gasoline to conspicuously display the type and percentage of alcohol and cosolvent to ultimate purchasers at the point of sale. Grants the Federal Trade Commission investigative and enforcement powers to implement this Act. Requires the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) conduct field tests determining alcohol type and percentage (including the percentage of cosolvents) in gasoline; and (2) notify the Federal Trade Commission of any failures to post such information. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate rules for the uniform display and certification of alcohol and cosolvent content in alcohol-blended gasoline. Provides that a violation of this Act shall be considered an unfair or deceptive act affecting commerce within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Terminates the National Boating Safety Advisory Council on September 30, 1990. Decreases from 21 to 17 the number of members on such Council and revises provisions concerning the composition of such Council. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to fill vacancies in the Council."
