Requires short-term removal actions undertaken by the Administrator to contribute to the degree possible to the efficient performance of any long-term action. Requires coordinated action among Federal and State natural resource trustees when hazardous substance releases threaten such resources. Increases the maximum time and funding limit on short-term response actions when appropriate. Requires States to assure the availability of hazardous waste disposal facilities sufficient for the next 20 years' wastes. Credits States with expenditures made at National Priorities List (NPL) sites on cost-eligible response actions. Revises other State cost-sharing measures. Treats long-term cleanup of groundwater or surface water as a part of the costs of remedial action.

Directs the Administrator of EPA to list and periodically revise a list of hazardous substances which pose the most significant potential threat to human health. Includes pollutants or contaminants to the degree they are determined to be hazardous. Directs the Administrator of ATSDR to establish and maintain an inventory of information on the health effects of each listed substance. Requires such Administrator to also develop toxicological profiles for each such substance, assessing the current state of knowledge of their deleterious effects, and revising such profiles at least every three years. Requires the Administrator to initiate research where inadequate information on a substance is available. Requires Federal coordination of research efforts. Requires the Administrator of ATSDR to perform a health assessment for each NPL facility where a significant possibility exists that a human population has been exposed to hazardous substances existing at such facility and a significant threat of adverse health effects exists.

Authorizes the Administrator to make assistance available to affected individuals to help them evaluate and assess technical information and data. Prohibits the Administrator from taking a response action to certain types of releases unless such releases constitute a public health or environmental emergency. Prohibits response to releases: (1) of naturally occurring substances; (2) of building products; (3) into drinking water supply systems due to ordinary deterioration; and (4) from specified coal mining sites. Grants highest cleanup priority to releases which have contaminated or closed a sole or principal drinking water source. Requires the consideration of certain factors when adopting offsite remedies, including the long-term risks and uncertainties of land disposal. Requires a study of the shortage of skilled personnel at EPA to administer this Act. Requires radon contaminated soil to be disposed of as low-level radioactive waste. Exempts response-action contractors from liability for nonnegligent cleanup activities if they would not otherwise have been liable. Opens competition for response-actions to all interested contractors, subject to Federal and State requirements. Includes Federal facilities under CERCLA as if they were private facilities, except for certain financial responsibility and time period provisions. Applies the relevant State law when a Federal facility is not on the NPL. Requires the Administrator to establish a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket for each Federal agency and department which will include information on off-site contamination and monitoring data, and releases of reportable quantities of hazardous substances. Requires that such information be made available to the public. Requires the Administrator to evaluate certain Federal facilities by January 31, 1987, for placement on the NPL, using NCP criteria. Requires the commencement of a RIFS within six months of a Federal site's placement on the NPL. Directs the Administrator to review the RIFS and enter into interagency agreements for cleanup when necessary, allowing for public participation. Requires each agency to report annually to the Congress on its implementation progress. Requires Federal agencies to notify buyers or transferees of Federal land where hazardous substances were disposed of or stored. Authorizes a State to act as an on-scene coordinator at EPA expense for Federal facility cleanups in such State. Sets forth special rules to protect national security at defense facilities needing cleanup. Requires the Administrator to select appropriate cost-effective remedial actions in accordance with the NCP. Requires remedial actions selected to provide sufficient control or amelioration of the hazardous substance so as to protect human health and the environment. Requires such measures to take into account the long-term effectiveness of the solution and the alternative technologies available to the maximum extent possible. Requires a standard of control at least as strict as that provided by any other applicable Federal environmental law for onsite disposal. Requires offsite disposal to be in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Permits waivers of otherwise applicable requirements under specified conditions. Requires compliance with otherwise applicable permit requirements for offsite and Federal site disposal, but not for onsite disposal.

Establishes standards of treatment technology for dioxin wastes. Requires a value engineering review of the cost-effectiveness of response actions in excess of $4,000,000 dollars.

Permits the Administrator to fund part of such response. Limits the liability of the cleaning up party to that specified in the agreement. Permits the Administrator to take action against any person not a party to such agreement. Enters such agreements in the appropriate U.S. district court as consent agreements, enforceable as such. Directs the Administrator to notify potentially responsible parties of each other's identities and of the seriousness of the necessary cleanup, providing a moratorium on the commencement of remedial action for a specified period after such notice has been given. Grants notified persons an opportunity to submit a proposal to the Administrator for the undertaking or financing of remedial action. Permits the Administrator to commence remedial action if no good faith proposal is forthcoming within a specified period. Authorizes the Administrator to proceed on remedial actions where a significant public health threat exists regardless of the status of negotiations. Authorizes the Administrator to agree to refrain from pursuing any future liability of a person if an approved response action would be expedited and the person is in full compliance with the consent decree. Permits such an agreement only in the public interest after an evaluation of the effectiveness of the remedy and the nature of the remaining risks. Places premiums from such agreements into the Groundwater and Surface Water Protection Fund for future remedial actions at other facilities. Permits the Administrator to settle with persons whose share of response costs is not substantial. Authorizes EPA to settle certain claims not yet referred to the Department of Justice.

Makes such date the time a plaintiff should reasonably have known exposure to such a substance caused or contributed to a personal injury. Renames the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund the Hazardous Substances Superfund. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize the Administrator to provide for the cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks. Requires the Administrator to use funds in the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for such purposes, but holds the owners and operators of such tanks strictly liable for such costs. Authorizes State implementation of such authority under specified conditions, authorizing the Administrator to make grants to such States for such purpose. Directs the Comptroller General to study the availability of pollution liability insurance for owners and operators of such tanks.
