    "text": "Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to require lakes, rivers, and streams to be meandered in accordance with specified principles whenever the Secretary of the Interior surveys land selected by an Alaska Native, a Native Corporation, or the State. Prohibits certain size lakes, rivers, and streams from being meandered if title to lands beneath such navigable waters did not vest in the State under the Submerged Lands Act. Provides that when the Secretary conveys land to an Alaska Native, a Native Corporation, or the State which abuts or surrounds a meanderable lake, river, or stream, then any U.S. interest in the land under such lake, river, or stream, shall vest in and not be charged against the entitlement of such Native, Native Corporation, or State. Incorporates the terms of a specified document into this Act. Makes the Bureau of Land Management the final agency with respect to the execution of an interim conveyance or patent or determination of navigability for areas of land selected by a Native or Native Corporation which surround or abut bodies of water. Entitles a Native Corporation prevailing on a challenge to its ownership of lands underlying a body of water to costs and attorney's fees."
