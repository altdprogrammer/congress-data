Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 for the U.S. Customs Service. Earmarks specified amounts for the operation and maintenance of the air interdiction program of the Service and for programs to enforce or monitor export controls under the Export Administration Act of 1979. Prohibits using any Customs Service funds to close any port of entry at which, during FY 1985: (1) not less than 2,500 merchandise entries were made; and (2) not less than $1,500,000 in customs revenues were assessed. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of the Treasury for FY 1986 for: (1) making payments out of the Customs Forfeiture Fund; and (2) providing customs services at airports. Directs the Commissioner of Customs to use any savings resulting from administrative consolidations to strengthen the commercial operations of the Customs Service by increasing the number of inspector, import specialist, patrol officer, and other line operational positions. Prohibits the Commissioner from publishing or taking any other action to give force and effect to a final rule that would revise the current rule relating to the requirement for sureties on customs bonds: (1) unless the Commissioner submits a report to the Congress containing specified information; and (2) until 90 days of continuous session of the Congress after such report is submitted. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to limit the number of officers and employees that the U.S. Trade Representative may appoint without regard to civil service regulations. Authorizes appropriations for the Office of the United States Trade Representative for FY 1986. Decreases the amount earmarked for entertainment and representation expenses."
