Expresses the support of the Congress for necessary research and development to assure an adequate chemical weapons deterrent policy. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should seek the cooperation of the Soviet Union in achieving a mutual and verifiable ban on the use, production, and stockpiling of lethal chemical weapons; (2) the Secretary of Defense should improve the capabilities of U.S. armed forces to detect, and protect themselves against, the use of lethal chemical weapons; and (3) such weapons must be stockpiled and available in those areas of Europe where chemical attacks would most likely occur. Provides that the Congress will consider the repeal of its prohibition against chemical weapons funding if members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) accept the peacetime deployment of chemical weapons in their territory."
