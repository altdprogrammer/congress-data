    "text": "(House disagreed to Senate amendment) Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 - Title I: Agricultural Programs - Subtitle A: Agricultural Program Savings - Declares that, for purposes of determining savings under this Act, the expenditures and outlays resulting from title XI (export sales of dairy products) and title XIII (emergency disaster loans and loan authorizations under the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (H.R. 2100) shall be counted as having been enacted under this Act. Subtitle B: Tobacco Program Improvements - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set the price supports for the 1985 and 1986 crops of: (1) Flue-cured tobacco at $1.438 per pound; and (2) Burley tobacco at $1.488 per pound. Sets the price support level for any kind of tobacco (other than Flue-cured and Burley) for which marketing quotas are in effect or not disapproved by producers at the preceding year's price, plus or minus the amount by which the current crop's price is greater or less than the preceding year's price, as such difference may be adjusted by the Secretary of Agriculture. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce the support level if requested by a producer association. Sets the price support level for the 1987 and subsequent crops of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco at the preceding year's level, plus or minus an adjustment of 65 percent to 100 percent of the total of: (1) two-thirds of the amount by which the previous five years' average marketing price is greater or less than the preceding year's average price; and (2) one-third of the change in the index of prices paid by tobacco farmers during the previous calendar year. Sets forth reduction adjustments for the average prices of the 1984 and 1985 marketing years. Repeals the provision authorizing the Secretary to reduce price supports for certain low quality grades of Flue-cured tobacco.

Requires the Secretary to set the national marketing quota for Flue-cured and Burley at between 103 percent and 97 percent of the total of: (1) the aggregate of projected cigarette purchases; (2) the previous three years' average annual exports; and (3) the amount of tobacco the Secretary determines necessary to increase or decrease producer association inventories to maintain such inventories at reserve stock levels. Requires the national marketing quota for both Flue-cured and Burley tobacco to be at least: (1) 94 percent of the preceding year's quota for the 1986 through 1989 marketing years; and (2) 90 percent for the 1990 through 1993 marketing years. Limits downward adjustments in the national Burley marketing quota to the greater of: (1) 35,000,000 pounds; or (2) 50 percent of the amount by which total Burley inventories of a producer association exceed reserve stock levels. Requires cigarette manufacturers to submit to the Secretary an annual confidential projection of the amount of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco they intend to buy at auction or from producers during the succeeding marketing year. Directs the Secretary to establish the projection if a manufacturer fails to provide such information. Subjects Department of Agriculture officers or employees to loss of office and fines or imprisonment for violations of such confidentiality provisions. Reduces the amount of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco that may be marketed without penalty from 110 percent to 103 percent of the farm marketing quota. Establishes the annual marketing quota announcement date for: (1) Burley tobacco as February 1; and (2) other tobacco as March 1. Requires cigarette manufacturers to submit to the Secretary on a confidential basis at the end of each marketing year the amount of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco purchases during such year. Subjects manufacturers to a penalty (twice the per pound assessment times the amount by which purchases are less than 90 percent of projected purchases) for failure to purchase at least 90 percent of their Burley and Flue-cured projected purchases. Requires penalties to be transmitted to the appropriate associations for deposit in the No Net Cost Fund or Account. Requires Flue-cured and Burley tobacco purchasers to pay to the appropriate associations assessments on all purchases of such tobacco marketed by a producer from a farm. States that such assessments shall be determined so that producers and purchasers share equally in maintaining association Funds. Requires assessments to be collected from: (1) the person acquiring the tobacco; (2) the warehouseman or agent if the tobacco is marketed through such person; or (3) the producer on sales (by the producer) to a person outside the United States. Subjects persons who fail to collect and remit such assessment to a penalty. Provides for: (1) notice and hearing opportunity; and (2) U.S. district court review. Provides that for the 1986 and subsequent Burley crops assessments shall be determined without regard to any losses the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) may sustain with respect to the 1983 Burley Crop. Provides with regard to inventory purchases that: (1) 1976 through 1984 Flue-cured stocks shall be offered for sale at the base prices (including carrying charges) in effect on the offer date, reduced by 90 percent for 1976 through 1981 tobacco, and ten percent for 1982 through 1984 tobacco; and (2) 1982 Burley stocks shall be offered for sale at the July 1, 1985, price and 1984 stocks shall be offered for sale at the associations' costs as of the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the CCC, with regard to the 1983 Burley crop, to: (1) take title to such crop held by the associations by calling in the loans on such tobacco; (2) offer such crop for sale as the CCC deems appropriate; and (3) offer any stocks remaining two years after such loan call-in at the associations' costs on the loan call date, reduced by 90 percent. Authorizes cigarette manufacturers to purchase tobacco inventories over an eight-year period for Flue-cured tobacco and a five-year period for Burley tobacco.

Title IV: Transportation and Related Programs - Subtitle A: Railroads - Amtrak Reauthorization Act of 1985 - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize appropriations for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for FY 1986 through 1988. Requires that certain appropriated funds designated by Amtrak for nonoperational capital projects be used to maintain Amtrak's rail system operations at the level in effect on the date of enactment of this Act (unless funds are otherwise available to maintain such operations at substantially the same level of service). Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to provide that preferred stock issued by Amtrak to the Secretary of Transportation in return for Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date that Amtrak received such assistance (thus allowing Amtrak to take advantage of a certain depreciation allowance). Permits Amtrak to participate in the contract air program administered by the General Services Administration in markets where service provided by Amtrak is competitive (thus including Amtrak among the competitors for the Federal employee travel market). Sets February 15 as the annual deadline for Amtrak to submit specified data to the Congress. Repeals the requirement that Amtrak enter into industry-wide rail carrier agreements regarding the operation of special and charter trains between specific routes. Authorizes the Comptroller General to conduct annual audits of Amtrak activities (thus making such audits discretionary instead of mandatory). Repeals title VII of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which provides for federally guaranteed emergency financial assistance to enable railroads to enter into operating contracts with Amtrak.

Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to repeal the requirement that Amtrak establish a Performance Evaluation Center. Requires Amtrak to set a goal, beginning in FY 1986, of recovering at least 61 percent of its operating costs from its revenues (currently the statutory goal is to recover 50 percent of operating costs from revenues). Requires Amtrak and representatives of Amtrak employees to negotiate changes in existing agreements that will result in cost savings to Amtrak, and requires the results of such negotiations to be reported to the Congress within a specified time. Prohibits Amtrak from reducing the frequency of service on any line which, on May 1, 1985, had three or fewer trains operating per week. Amends the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 to require the Railroad Retirement Board to issue a warning to any railroad which fails to notify the Board of job vacancies. Establishes a civil penalty to be imposed upon a railroad which is found guilty of two or more failures to notify the Board of job vacancies. Extends from four years to six years the expiration date of the central register of railroad employment maintained by the Board. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to provide for Amtrak auto-ferry service of unoccupied vehicles when space is available. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize Amtrak to discontinue commuter train service which does not meet the avoidable loss per passenger mile criterion for short distance trains unless an affected State agrees to ensure that such criterion will be met. States that a joint congressional resolution shall be the congressional oversight mechanism for any changes proposed by Amtrak to its Route and Service criteria. Eliminates the passenger mile per train mile criterion for Amtrak route service. Amends the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 to prohibit the Interstate Commerce Commission from allowing cross subsidization between intercity and commuter rail passenger service in the Commission's resolution of Northeast Corridor cost disputes involving non-Amtrak commuter authorities and freight railroads. Amends the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 to repeal the requirement that the Commission determine within a specified time a costing methodology for compensation to Amtrak by Conrail for certain rail freight service over the Northeast Corridor. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to reduce from 180 days to 120 days the period within which the Commission must: (1) resolve rail service compensation disputes; and (2) modify the criteria used by the Commission in determining Amtrak's compensation for use of the Northeast Corridor by freight railroads and commuter authorities.

Increases from the $30,000,000 to $55,000,000 the amount of emergency relief which the Secretary is authorized to expend for natural disasters or catastrophic failures occurring in any State in 1985. Directs the Secretary to permanently withhold ten percent of highway funds apportionments from any State which does not have in effect a permanent 21-year-old minimum drinking age on the first day of FY 1989. Deems a State to be in compliance with the 21 year old national minimum drinking age requirement if such State has enacted a law within a specified time period which allows persons under 21 who had the right to drink under previous law to retain their legal drinking age status. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 to provide that funds which exceed the amounts needed for certain bridge demonstration projects shall be available to implement certain state-of-the-art bridge technology demonstration projects in Ohio. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding the results of using such technology. Title V: Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Federal Communications Commission - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize appropriations for FY 1986 through 1988 to be used by the Secretary of Commerce to assist in the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities. Repeals a provision that requires 75 percent of the funds appropriated for such purposes in a fiscal year to be available to extend delivery of public telecommunications services to areas not receiving such services. Authorizes appropriations, to match up to a specified amount of non-Federal contributions to public broadcasting entities, for the Public Broadcasting Fund for FY 1987 through 1990.
