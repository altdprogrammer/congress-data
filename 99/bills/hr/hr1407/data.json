Prohibits the Government's attorney from presenting evidence which such attorney knows was obtained in violation of the Constitution. Requires the Government's attorney to: (1) disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury; and (2) advise a person upon whom a grand jury has begun to focus an investigation of his or her rights with regard to such investigation. Provides a procedure for a grand jury subpoena. Establishes rights for a grand jury witness. Allows a witness before a grand jury to be accompanied by counsel. Permits a witness to be found in contempt for refusing to comply with an order of the court to testify or to produce a book, paper, or document in a proceeding before or ancillary to a grand jury. Prohibits a grand jury from naming a person in an indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator. Declares that grand jury reports should not single out a person to impugn his or her motives or hold such person up to scorn or criticism. Provides for a motion to expunge objectionable portions of a report before it is made public."
