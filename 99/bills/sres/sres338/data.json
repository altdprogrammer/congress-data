Amends rule XV and rule XXVII to waive the reading of any motion or amendment or conference report that has been printed and available at the desk of the Members at least 24 hours before being offered or presented. Amends rule XXII to reduce debate after cloture from 100 hours to 20 hours. Amends rule XVI to provide that if a point of order is made against an amendment to a general appropriations bill on certain grounds, then it shall not be in order to raise the defense of germaneness unless there is House legislative language on that subject contained in the bill."
