Provides that if such purchases are inadequate to offset the amount of meat being marketed under the program, the Secretary shall decrease meat imports, or increase purchases and exports. Directs the Secretary to ensure the orderly marketing of such dairy cattle consistent with historical beef and dairy marketing patterns."
