Requires the Committee on Rules and Administration to determine such costs. Urges the House of Representatives to make similar expenditure limitations. Directs the Committee to prescribe: (1) a recordkeeping system to ensure that allocated amounts are not exceeded; and (2) a procedure to transfer portions of an allocation from one Senate office to another. Directs the Committee, during the 100th Congress, to study the feasibility of revising the manner in which funds for official mail costs are appropriated, expended, and accounted for, and report findings and recommendations to the Senate."
