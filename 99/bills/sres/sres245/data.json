Requires that broadcasts be supervised and operated by the Senate and made available on a live basis and free of charge to specified entities. Requires the television broadcasts to follow the Presiding Officer and Senators who are recognized to speak. Directs the Architect of the Capitol to provide for the construction and acquisition of broadcasting facilities and equipment. Sets forth duties of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate with respect to the operation and maintenance of such equipment and the disposition of audio and video tape recordings. Directs the Librarian of Congress and the Archivist of the United States to receive, store, and make such recordings available to the public at no cost for viewing or listening on the premises. Authorizes the charging of a fee equal to the cost involved through distribution of taped copies. Provides for a test period of Senate broadcasting equipment. Prohibits the use of tape duplications of broadcast coverage for political or commercial purposes. Requires that changes in regulations made by this resolution be made only by Senate resolution. Authorizes expenditures, limited to a specified amount, to carry out this resolution. Amends rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate to prohibit the reporting of legislative measures from committees by polling (committee members not physically present for committee vote). Amends rule XXX to revise the method of considering treaties. Amends rule XII to revise the voting procedure by authorizing the Majority Leader, in concurrence with the Minority Leader, to determine when a roll call shall be by electronic device. Sets forth requirements for Senators upon such determination. Amends rule XVI to provide that if a point of order is made against an amendment to a general appropriations bill on certain grounds, then it shall not be in order to raise the defense of germaneness unless there is House legislative language on that subject contained in the bill. Amends rule XVII to change from three days to two days the time that reported measures must be available to members prior to consideration. Amends rule XV to set forth the procedure for imposing a germaneness requirement on floor amendments. Requires a three-fifths vote of Senators present and voting to ban the consideration of non-germane amendments to a particular bill or resolution for the remainder of a calendar day. Requires a two-thirds vote of Senators present and voting to overturn the Presiding Officer's decision on a question of germaneness or to hold an amendment germane. Declares that no amendment proposing sense of the Senate (or Congress) language that does not directly relate to the pending matter shall be considered germane. Amends rule XXII to expedite cloture activities, including: (1) a requirement that Senators be present and voting; and (2) a reduction from 100 hours to 20 hours of length of a filibuster before cloture can be invoked."
