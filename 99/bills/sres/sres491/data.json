    "text": "States that the Senate: (1) declares that the Soviet action in imprisoning and falsely charging U.S. foreign correspondent Nicholas Daniloff reflects the failure of the Soviet Union to observe internationally recognized human rights and to be committed to any international agreements, including arms control agreements; (2) urges the President to continue his demands for the unconditional release of Nicholas Daniloff and condition his agreement to a summit meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev on the prompt return of Mr. Daniloff; (3) urges the President to limit discussions on arms control issues with the Soviet Union, and to refrain from concluding any arms control agreements with the Soviets, until they release Mr. Daniloff and demonstrate a willingness to observe basic standards of international conduct; (4) declares that the Senate should not ratify any arms control agreement with the Soviet Union, or new economic or commercial agreements, until Mr. Daniloff departs the Soviet Union; and (5) calls on the President to demand in his September 22 speech to the United Nations that the Soviet Union remove its spies from the United Nations and end its violations of the United Nations Charter."
