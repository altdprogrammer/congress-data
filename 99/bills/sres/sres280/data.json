    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the aspirations of the Angolan people deserve U.S. support; (2) the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and its leader, Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, have the right to play a role in the political life of Angola; and (3) the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has violated the rights of the Angolan people. Declares that the MPLA should agree to negotiations which will include UNITA, end the presence of Soviet and Cuban forces in Angola, and result in prompt and fair elections for a new government. Provides that if the MPLA continues to refuse to negotiate with UNITA or continues to prepare for a new military offensive, then the Senate would support the provision in early 1986 of material assistance to UNITA."
