    "text": "Amends rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate to lower the authorized membership on specified standing and joint committees. Limits each Senator to service on nine committees and subcommittees, except members of the Appropriations Committee who are limited to service on 11 committees and subcommittees. Restricts a Senator to service on two subcommittees of each committee of which the Senator is a member. Prohibits committees from establishing more than five subcommittees. Prohibits the Committee on Appropriations from establishing more than 13 subcommittees. Revises the formula for determining how many, and which, subcommittee a Senator may chair. Repeals certain provisions which granted exceptions to committee service rules. Amends rule XXVI to require the chairman, when times of committee mark-up meetings are scheduled, to announce which members have other previously scheduled mark-up meetings at such times. Declares that when reporting measures from any committee, with a majority of its members present, such committee shall be deemed to consist of the number of its members exclusive of the majority and minority leaders. Amends rule XVII to provide that legislation reported by any standing committee having subject matter within the jurisdiction of another standing committee shall, at the request of such other committee, be referred to it prior to Senate consideration. Establishes for the first session of the 99th Congress the Select Committee on the Two Year Budget to review and recommend legislative proposals to improve the operation of the congressional budget process, including proposals for the two-year budget. Requires a report from such committee within 180 days after adoption of this provision. Amends Senate Resolution 400, 94th Congress, to prohibit service on the Select Committee on Intelligence for more than ten years (currently, eight years)."
