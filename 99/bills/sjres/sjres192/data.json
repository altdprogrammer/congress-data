    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1986-03-18", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 99-262) Amends the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America to provide for the payment of $228,000,000 in guaranteed annual amounts of direct grant assistance for capital development (including government operations and special programs) to the Government of the Northern Mariana Islands for FY 1986 through 1992. Sets forth the formula for the distribution of such funds. Amends the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 to require the Secretary of Transportation to provide an exemption from applicable noise standards to noncomplying aircraft that fly between Honolulu, Hawaii, or other nations and points in the U.S. Pacific territories or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Prohibits such aircraft from operating at any other U.S. airports. Exempts such aircraft that operate in Honolulu, the U.S. Pacific territories, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from nighttime noise restrictions provided the State of Hawaii institutes nighttime noise restrictions for Honolulu International Airport that are applied equally to all operators and that are no more restrictive than the existing restrictions. Amends specified Federal law to allow the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) modify specified maintenance or level of effort requirements in the award of certain assistance grants to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands; and (2) waive certain requirements and limitations with respect to the award of water quality grants for sewer and related facilities to such territories. Amends the Organic Act of Guam to authorize the Government of Guam to establish an Office of Public Prosecutor and an Office of Public Auditor. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that an alien crewman serving upon a U.S. fishing vessel who intends to temporarily land in Guam shall be considered a nonimmigrant alien for purposes of entry into such port. Provides that the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Interior may grant a temporary 15-day waiver to the applicable visa requirements for nonimmigrant aliens who apply for admission into Guam. Sets forth specified conditions with respect to such waiver. Excludes Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) employees employed to implement such provisions from being counted for purposes of personnel ceiling in either the INS or the Department of Justice. Exempts Government of Guam employees from specified Federal law time limitations with respect to their assignment to the INS. Authorizes the Attorney General to receive from Guam reimbursement for increased costs associated with the administering of these provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Requires the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor of Guam, to issue regulations governing the admission of nonimmigrant aliens pursuant to the visa waiver authorized under this Act."
