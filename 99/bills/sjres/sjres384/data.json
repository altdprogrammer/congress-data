Terminates the prohibition on loans to Chile if the Congress: (1) finds that the Government of Chile has ended its abuse of internationally recognized human rights, has agreed to extradite those individuals indicted for the murders of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffit, and has brought to justice those individuals responsible for the death of Rodrigo Rojas; and (2) enacts a joint resolution repealing such prohibition."
