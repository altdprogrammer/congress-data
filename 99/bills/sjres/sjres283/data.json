    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Declares it to be U.S. policy that: (1) the building of democracy and the restoration of peace in Central America are important to U.S. interests; and (2) the Contadora Document of Objectives which provides for a framework of peace in the region is to be encouraged and supported. Declares that the United States supports, as essential to such objectives, a national reconciliation in Nicaragua and a verifiable agreement based on the Document of Objectives, including free and fair elections. States that U.S. policy toward Nicaragua shall be based upon Nicaragua's responsiveness to the concerns affecting U.S. national security and Nicaragua's neighbors. Declares that the United States will address such concerns through economic, political and diplomatic measures, including support for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance and bilateral negotiations with Nicaragua aimed at peacefully resolving the conflict. States that the duration of such negotiations shall depend on whether Nicaragua respects certain human freedoms and there has been a halt to the introduction of foreign military personnel and Nicaraguan aggression (including support for international terrorism). Provides that U.S. actions are consistent with its right to defend itself and assist its allies in accordance with international law. Declares it to be U.S. policy to assist all groups within the Nicaraguan democratic resistance which are committed to national reconciliation in Nicaragua. Prohibits assistance to groups which violate internationally recognized human rights or engage in drug smuggling. Authorizes the transfer of $100,000,000 to the President for the Nicaraguan resistance. Makes available out of such funds $30,000,000 for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Nicaraguan resistance through the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office. Subjects the use of such funds to specified Federal laws. Makes available out of any unobligated funds, if there has been a peaceful resolution of the conflict, sums for the relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of Central American countries. Transfers specified funds to the President for the participation of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in negotiations to promote peace in Central America. Limits such aid to the Nicaraguan resistance to specified forms of assistance. Terminates such restrictions on and after July 1, 1986, if the President determines and reports to the Congress (and the Congress does not disapprove additional assistance) that: (1) the Central American countries have not concluded an agreement; (2) Nicaragua is not engaged in serious dialogue with the democratic opposition; and (3) there is no reasonable prospect for such agreement or dialogue. Prohibits funds under this Act from being obligated or expended on or after July 1, 1986, unless the President reports to the Congress that the Nicaraguan resistance groups are taking certain actions. Sets forth specified congressional procedures with respect to approving or disapproving aid under this Act. Establishes the Commission on Central American Negotiations to monitor and report to a specified congressional committee on Nicaraguan resistance efforts to coordinate the negotiations for peace in Central America. Sets forth the composition of the Commission. Terminates the Commission 30 days after the transmittal of the report. Requires the President to transmit to the Congress a report on actions taken to resolve the conflict in Central America. Sets forth provisions relating to the request of additional assistance."
