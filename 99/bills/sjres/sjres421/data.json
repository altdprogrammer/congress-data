Expresses the sense of the Congress that DOE should: (1) accord the same priority to putting its facilities into compliance with environmental laws as it accords to meeting nuclear materials and weapons production goals; (2) provide for independent inspections by affected State agencies regarding the Department's treatment and disposal of mixed wastes that may be exempt from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulation; (3) provide for an independent examination by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of Safety Analysis Reviews of its nuclear facilities; and (4) report to the Congress regarding plans and cost estimates for bringing DOE defense facilities into compliance with environmental laws."
