    "text": "Declares that each standing committee of the House of Representatives shall, not later than September 17, 1990, submit to the House Budget Committee alternatives to the report of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), insofar as such report affects laws within the jurisdiction of the committee. Requires the Budget Committee, not later than September 20, 1990, to report a resolution containing instructions to committees sufficient to achieve the total level of deficit reduction contained in the Director's report for FY 1991. Provides that such instructions shall require that each committee (and each subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations) achieve the same level of deficit reduction with respect to programs under its jurisdiction as would have been saved under the Director's report. Requires committees to submit recommendations to the Budget Committee by September 25, 1991, sufficient to meet deficit reductions. Requires the Budget Committee to promptly report a reconciliation bill carrying out such recommendations. Authorizes the Budget Committee to include legislative language within the jurisdiction of any noncomplying committee. Requires such reconciliation bill to include a provision which states that if it is enacted on or before October 15, 1990, then the President's sequestration order for FY 1991 is null and void. Establishes procedures for floor consideration of such reconciliation bill, including limitation on debates and amendments."
