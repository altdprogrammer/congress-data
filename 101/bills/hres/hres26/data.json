    "text": "Supports U.S. assistance to the Afghan resistance. Declares that any settlement in Afghanistan must: (1) provide for Afghan self-determination; (2) outline a definite timetable of less than ten months for the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops; and (3) provide for the safe return of refugees. Supports Pakistan's efforts to achieve a settlement agreement in current negotiations in Geneva with Pakistan. Urges the President to support a solution acceptable to the Afghan resistance, insist on the withdrawal of Soviet advisers with the troops, require the Soviets to terminate all forms of military assistance to the Kabul regime, and ensure continued international assistance to the Afghan refugees until all Soviet bloc forces have been withdrawn. Expresses the House of Representatives': (1) support for increased U.S. humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people during and following a Soviet withdrawal; (2) support for an international observer force to monitor Soviet compliance with a withdrawal agreement; (3) belief that the U.S. Government should not restrict assistance to the Afghan resistance until the President has determined that the Soviets have ended their occupation and that the mujahadeen can maintain its integrity during the transition period leading to new elections; and (4) sense that U.S. obligations are contingent on Soviet compliance with any withdrawal agreement."
