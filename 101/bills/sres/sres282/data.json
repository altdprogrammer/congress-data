Calls upon all parties to the conflict to comply with provisions of the Geneva Convention which establish the right of noncombatants to humane treatment. Urges the President to: (1) convey to the Government of Liberia U.S. concerns about human rights abuses in Liberia since 1980; (2) urge such Government to quickly resolve the conflict in a manner which permits Liberian refugees to return to their homes; (3) support efforts to meet humanitarian needs of such refugees in neighboring countries; (4) bar U.S. military advisors from accompanying Liberian troops in fighting the insurgency in Nimba County; and (5) consider recent events in such County in making the assessment to human rights required under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1990. Sets forth conditions for resumption of military assistance to Liberia in the event that the suspension of foreign assistance is no longer required under provisions restricting assistance to countries in default on foreign assistance loans. Calls on the Liberian Government to honor its commitment to hold scheduled elections in 1991 and to ensure a free and fair election process."
