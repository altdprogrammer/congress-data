    "text": "Limits the amounts that may be incurred by a Senate office for official mail costs (OMCs) for non-election fiscal years and election fiscal years to the amounts allocated by the Committee on Rules and Administration. Requires the Committee to determine: (1) the amount appropriated for OMCs of the Senate for each fiscal year; (2) the amount necessary for OMCs of Senate offices other than Senators for each fiscal year; (3) the amount necessary to be reserved for contingencies; (4) for each non-election fiscal year, the amount available for allocation to all Senators; and (5) for each election fiscal year, the amounts necessary for OMCs of Senators-elect, newly elected Senators, Senators whose service will end on January 3 of such fiscal year, and all other Senators. Directs the Committee to make allocations to: (1) each Senate office (other than a Senator-elect) for each fiscal year; and (2) each Senator-elect, newly elected Senator, Senator whose service will end on January 3 of an election fiscal year, and all other Senators for each fiscal year according to a specified formula based on the relative population of each State. Sets limitations on the distribution of amounts reserved for contingencies. Provides for the distribution of contingency funds remaining unused at the end of a fiscal year in accordance with the regular OMC allocation formula. Requires the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate to send: (1) to each Senator an itemized statement of the cost of postage and paper and of the other operating expenses incurred as a result of mass mailings processed during each calendar quarter, including the total cost per capita in the State represented by the Senator; and (2) to the Committee a compilation of all such statements. Requires the cover sheet of each document in a mass mailing of a Senate office to display a prominent notice that the document was prepared, published, and mailed at taxpayer expense. Limits mass mailings by Senators to two sheets of legal size paper (or the equivalent). Requires the Committee to: (1) monitor all expenditures for official mail by all Senate offices; and (2) promulgate regulations to assure compliance by each Senate office with the allocations, allowances, and restrictions provided for in this Act, including regulations prescribing a procedure for the transfer of portions of an allocation from one Senate office to another. Requires all mass mailings by Senate offices to be printed, prepared, and mailed by the Senate Service Department and mailed under the frank. Sets forth additional provisions regarding: (1) limitations on the number of pieces of mass mail allowed as franked mail during any fiscal year; and (2) the amount of paper and envelopes provided to Senators and specified committees and offices. Makes this Act effective only with respect to FY 1990."
