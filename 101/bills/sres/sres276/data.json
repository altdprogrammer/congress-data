Declares that until the Soviet Government ends its policy of economic coercion against Lithuania the U.S. Government should not: (1) proceed with planned U.S.-Soviet negotiations on trade, civil aviation, maritime transportation, and investment and tax treaties; (2) consider granting the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trade treatment; or (3) support granting the Soviet Union observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Urges the U.S. Government to encourage coordinated allied responses to Soviet actions in Lithuania and to any expansion of coercive practices to Estonia and Latvia."
