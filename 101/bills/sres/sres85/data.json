Urges the President to devote sufficient resources from the cross-border assistance program for the democratic political reconstruction of Afghanistan. Commends the Government of Pakistan for supporting the resistance and caring for refugees. Encourages the President to continue to work closely with such Government. Calls upon the President to: (1) name an ambassadorial-level envoy to the Afghan resistance; and (2) report to specified Senate leaders on the details of current U.S. policy."
