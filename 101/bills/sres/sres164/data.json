Col. Higgins is in fact dead, should immediately inform his family, and, if he is dead, should ensure that his body is immediately returned to his family; (3) should any further executions of American hostages occur, the Senate will support appropriate retaliatory action; and (4) all groups or individuals holding American or other foreign hostages in Lebanon should immediately release such hostages, without precondition."
