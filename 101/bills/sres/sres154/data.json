Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should instruct the Secretary of Defense to postpone the signing of such MOU until: (1) a thorough review of such program is conducted by the Comptroller General; and (2) a specified report is submitted by the Republic of Korea to the Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed Services."
