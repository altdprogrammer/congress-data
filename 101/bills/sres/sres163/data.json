Supports the Baltic peoples in protesting the events of 1939-1940 which lead to their illegal annexation into the Soviet Union and supports their demands for self-determination. Urges the Soviet Union to renounce the Pact and its secret supplemental protocols as well as all claims to the Baltic States which are based on such protocols. Reaffirms U.S. policy of nonrecognition of the forcible incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union."
