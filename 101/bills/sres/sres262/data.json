Supports the newly emerging multiparty democracy and the actions of the Lithuanian people as they move to restore their national independence. Condemns: (1) the use of military force and economic coercion by the Soviet Union that denies the Lithuanian people their right to self-determination and freedom; (2) the terrorist activity of the KGB and the secret police; and (3) the legislation in the Supreme Soviet calling for the Central Government of Moscow to take over the newly elected government in Lithuania and nullify its decisions by imposing a state of emergency."
