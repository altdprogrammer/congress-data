Sets forth: (1) maximum deficit amounts; (2) public debt increase amounts; (3) deficit levels excluding trust fund surpluses; and (4) recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, the public debt, and Federal credit activity, including funding for each major functional category. Declares that the Congress finds that while the annual deficits appear to be decreasing, the Federal debt continues to increase annually by significantly greater amounts. Sets forth levels and amounts to show such discrepancy. Requires specified Senate and House Committees to report to their respective Committee on the Budget on changes in laws within their jurisdiction that provide spending authority sufficient to reduce budget authority and outlays by specified amounts. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets to nongovernment buyers; and (2) the amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. Assumes that, in the Senate, budget authority and outlays may be allocated to the Senate Committee on Finance for increased jurisdictional funding if the Committee on Finance or the committee of conference reports appropriate legislation."
