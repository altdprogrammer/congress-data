States that the basis for such reserve would be: (1) all signatory nations would agree not to bring virgin land into crop production and return a certain percentage of cropland to its natural state; and (2) an emergency provision to allow a portion of the cropland of all signatory nations to be put back in production if stocks fell below a level assuring adequate food supplies or if production did not meet domestic consumption."
