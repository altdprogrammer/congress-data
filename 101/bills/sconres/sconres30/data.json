Sets forth levels and amounts of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, and deficits for FY 1990 through 1992 for purposes of determining whether the maximum deficit amounts set forth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) have been exceeded. Indicates the following as amounts of the increase in the public debt subject to limitation: (1) $264,140,000,000 for FY 1990; (2) $253,230,000,000 for FY 1991; and (3) $227,530,000,000 for FY 1992. Shows deficit levels excluding government trust fund surpluses.

Recommends levels of Federal revenues of $775,800,000,000 for FY 1990, $832,000,000,000 for FY 1991, and $833,000,000,000 for FY 1992. Sets the amount by which the aggregate levels of Federal revenues should be increased at $5,800,000,000 for FY 1990 through 1992. Designates the following amounts of Federal revenues for Federal Insurance Contributions Act revenues for hospital insurance: (1) $70,100,000,000 for FY 1990; (2) $75,100,000,000 for FY 1991; and (3) $80,200,000,000 for FY 1992.

Sets the appropriate levels of the public debt at $3,122,540,000,000 for FY 1990, $3,375,770,000,000 for FY 1991, and $3,602,300,000,000 for FY 1992. Sets forth the appropriate levels of total Federal credit activity as follows: (1) $19,300,000,000 for new direct loan obligations, $106,600,000,000 for new primary loan guarantee commitments, and $93,200,000,000 for new secondary loan guarantee commitments for FY 1990; (2) $19,700,000,000 for new direct loan obligations, $114,200,000,000 for new primary loan guarantee commitments, and $97,100,000,000 for new secondary loan guarantee commitments for FY 1991; and (3) $19,700,000,000 for new direct loan obligations, $119,000,000,000 for new primary loan guarantee commitments, and $100,900,000,000 for new secondary loan guarantee commitments for FY 1992. Sets forth the levels of budget authority, budget outlays, new direct loan obligations, new primary loan guarantee commitments, and new secondary loan guarantee commitments for each major functional category for FY 1990 through 1992. Includes within this framework a discrete category indicating levels of gross interest on the public debt. Requires the following Senate and House Committees to report to the Committees on the Budget of their respective Houses by June 15, 1989, changes in laws within their respective jurisdictions that are sufficient to increase contributions and reduce budget authority and outlays by specified amounts in FY 1990: (1) Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; (2) Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, Urban Affairs; (3) Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; (4) Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works; (5) Senate Committee on Finance; (6) Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; (7) Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources; (8) Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs; (9) House Committee on Agriculture; (10) House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs; (11) House Committee on Education and Labor; (12) House Committee on Energy and Commerce; (13) House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs; (14) House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries; (15) House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service; (16) House Committee on Public Works and Transportation; (17) House Committee on Veterans' Affairs; and (18) House Committee on Ways and Means. Directs the Budget Committees to report to the House and Senate reconciliation legislation implementing the recommended changes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets to nongovernment buyers; and (2) the amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. Assumes deficit-neutral adjustments (contingent on legislation to make funds available) of allocations to: (1) the Senate Committee on Appropriations to provide for subsidized housing contract renewals and for increased Internal Revenue Service compliance funding; and (2) the Senate Committee on Finance for increased Medicaid funding. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the assumptions underlying the revenue totals included in this resolution do not include an increase in Federal excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel to reduce the Federal deficit. Expresses the sense of the Senate: (1) reflecting FY 1990 through 1992 deficit totals based on the economic and technical assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office; and (2) directing the participants in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement Between the President and the Joint Leadership of Congress, by July 1, 1989, to begin negotiations on an agreement for the FY 1991 budget based on CBO assumptions. Expresses the sense of the Congress that it should: (1) continue the commitment to keep the Social Security program secure; (2) enact legislation that excludes Social Security trust fund surpluses from the definition of the Federal budget deficit; and (3) revise the way in which Social Security trust fund surpluses are dealt with for budget deficit and deficit reduction target purposes for FY 1991 and thereafter. Expresses the sense of the Senate that this resolution should support funding increases included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Expresses the sense of the Senate suggesting a number of changes in the budgets of both the President and the Congress in the interest of more accurately presenting the Federal deficit. Requests the President to advise the Congress of any proposals relating to the reduction of the national debt and to inform the Congress as to whether additional revenues are required for debt and deficit reduction, as well as specific recommendations for obtaining them. Assumes deficit-neutral adjustments (contingent on legislation to make funds available) of allocations to the Senate Committee on Finance for increased funding for children. Expresses the sense of the Senate that sufficient funds should be provided to bring to a certain amount the level of Federal support for correctional activities at the Federal, State, and local level for expenses of drug offenders. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the 101st Congress should enact legislation to establish a biennial budget process. Expresses the sense of the Senate that all congressional and executive budget documents should prominently include the current level of Federal spending in each category and identify any proposed changes from that level. Expresses the sense of the Senate: (1) urging all parties to end efforts to secure a change in the Palestine Liberation Organization's observer status at the United Nations (U.S.); (2) calling upon member states of the United World Health Organization and other U.N. agencies to oppose such efforts; and (3) supporting the Secretary of State in calling for cessation of U.S. contributions to international organizations that grant full member status to non-states. Expresses the sense of the Senate concerning U.S. policy to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming, enumerating measures to encourage international cooperation in this attempt and to require Federal agencies to propose appropriate activities. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Government should adopt a position with respect to a Framework Global Climate Convention and should begin discussions in this direction at the next meeting of the Response Strategies Working Group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Expresses the sense of the Senate supporting continued funding of the National Aerospace Plane program at the level recommended in the President's budget. Assumes that agreements reached between the executive branch and congressional tax-writing committees on revenue legislation reconciled in accordance with this resolution will be advanced legislatively when supported by the President. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the FY 1990 budget agreement should be fully and quickly implemented in a bipartisan, cooperative effort. Expresses the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted to extend the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 to apply to agricultural losses due to weather conditions in 1988 or 1989 for crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989. Expresses the sense of the Senate setting a target maximum public debt amount and directing appropriate congressional committees to consider legislation to facilitate compliance as well as budget procedures to take effect if the target is exceeded."
