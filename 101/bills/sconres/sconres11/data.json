    "text": "Fair Employment Practices Resolution - Requires that personnel actions affecting employment positions in the Congress be made free from discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including marital and parental status), handicap, or age. Declares that interpretations under such requirement shall reflect the principles of current law as generally applicable to employment. States that such requirement does not prohibit the taking into consideration of: (1) the domicile of an individual with respect to a position under the clerk-hire allowance; or (2) the political affiliation of an individual with respect to a position under the clerk-hire allowance or a position on a committee staff. Sets forth a three-step procedure for consideration of alleged violations under this Act: (1) counseling and mediation; (2) formal complaint, hearing, and review by the Office of Fair Employment Practices; and (3) final review by the Review Panel. Establishes the Office of Fair Employment Practices. Provides for resolution by written agreement if, after a formal complaint is filed, the parties resolve the issues. Makes such agreements effective if approved by the Office or the Panel, whichever has the matter under review. Sets forth remedies which the Office or Panel may order. Provides for closed hearings and confidentiality. Makes the procedures and remedies under this resolution exclusive, except to the extent that specified congressional rules provide for additional procedures and remedies."
