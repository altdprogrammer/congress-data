Specifies that such reserve shall include: (1) agreement by signatory nations not to bring virgin land into crop production, to return a certain percentage of cropland to its natural state, and to keep such land out of production for a minimum of ten years; and (2) provisions calling for cropland to be taken out of production, implementation of sound conservation practices on such land to control soil erosion, and the return of a portion of such land to production if stocks fall below the emergency food reserve level or if the production of a signatory nation fails to meet domestic consumption demand."
