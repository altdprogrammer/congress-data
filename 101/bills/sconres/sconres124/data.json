Welcomes the decision of the Presidency of Yugoslavia to lift the state of emergency in the Province of Kosovo and the decision of the Yugoslav courts to acquit Azam Vlasi and 13 other ethnic Albanian defendants. Urges the Yugoslav and Serbian Governments to: (1) cease the use of force in Kosovo; (2) ensure that the lifting of the state of emergency results in the full restoration of freedoms curtailed under the state of emergency; (3) restore full autonomous status to Kosovo; and (4) allow free and fair elections throughout Yugoslavia at all levels of government. Urges the Yugoslav Government to: (1) investigate the indiscriminate killing of civilians by police forces; and (2) observe its obligations under the Helsinki Final Act. Urges Serbia to begin a dialogue with the Democratic Alliance Movement, other democratic forces in Kosovo, and the recently formed political parties and other democratic forces in Serbia to resolve the political and economic crisis in Yugoslavia. Requests: (1) the Department of State to monitor more closely human rights in Yugoslavia; and (2) the President to express congressional concerns about the situation in Kosovo and human rights violations in other parts of Yugoslavia to the Yugoslav Government."
