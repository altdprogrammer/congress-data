Deplores the use of food as a weapon by the Government of Sudan and by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and calls upon each to permit the safe passage of food and emergency relief supplies to civilians in affected areas. Urges the President and Secretary of State to: (1) provide international leadership in pressing for national reconciliation and an end to widespread starvation in Sudan; (2) reassess U.S.-Sudanese relations and U.S. assistance unless the Government of Sudan makes progress in facilitating increased relief to displaced populations and in negotiations for a ceasefire and peace accord; and (3) impress upon the SPLA its responsibility to permit the flow of international relief to civilians and to negotiate with the Government of Sudan for a national peace accord."
