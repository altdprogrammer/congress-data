Suspends for one year after the enactment of H.R. 3660: (1) requirements relating to private employment contacts between certain Department of Defense procurement officials and defense contractors and the limitations on their employment by contractors; and (2) restrictions on retired military officers participating in sales to, or claims against, the Government. Prohibits any adjustment in the pay rates or reduction in honoria limits for Senators until the first pay period after the President's sequestration order of October 16, 1989, is rescinded."
