    "text": "Deems service performed by an individual before the enactment of this Act as a case officer with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to be creditable service as a law enforcement officer for purposes of civil service retirement if such individual: (1) is a law enforcement officer; and (2) has at least five years of creditable civilian service (determined before taking any case officer service into account and disregarding any deposit or redeposit requirement). Sets civil service retirement annuities at two percent of the average pay for each year of CIA case officer service when such service is treated as law enforcement officer service. Declares that no amounts must be transferred or deposited into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund in excess of the amount required for transfer under the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees in order for case officer service to be considered creditable for individuals transferring directly from a Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System position to a Civil Service Retirement Service position. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act. Requires such regulations to include provisions to provide that, in the case of any individual whose transfer was not direct, the amount required for transfer or deposit will be determined as if the transfer had occurred: (1) without a break in service; and (2) at the time that such individual ceased to be a participant in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System."
