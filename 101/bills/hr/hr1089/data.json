    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-02-23", 
    "text": "Child Care and Education 2000 Act - Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1994, if appropriations under specified provisions of the Head Start Act equal or exceed specified amounts in those respective fiscal years. Title II: School-Based Child Care and Development - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a new title VIII program of grants to States for school-based child care or early childhood development programs that offer services in public school buildings. Allows States to provide such grant funds only to local educational agencies (LEAs) that: (1) require their schools to be in regular session at least 240 days per year; and (2) offer such child care and early development services for each day of the regular session. Requires LEAs to use such funds to expand or establish a school-based child care or early childhood development program that meets specified requirements. Mandates provision of such programs to certain families in which the parent or parents work, are seeking employment, or are in education or training programs: (1) at no cost to such families with income not more than 100 percent of the lower living standard income level (LLSIL); and (2) on an income-based fee schedule to such families with income not more than 150 percent of the LLISL. Requires the early childhood development program to include two-,three-, and four-year-olds from such families to the extent such no-cost services are not available under the Head Start Act. Requires the before- and after-school care program to cover such families where: (1) the parent or parents work or are in education or training programs; and (2) the children attend early childhood development programs or regular classes for kindergarten through sixth grade. Requires inclusion of private school children. Sets forth standards for such early childhood development programs, including requirements for adequate and nutritious meals and snacks, and, if practicable, health and social services. Sets forth program requirements for State educational agencies desiring to participate in the program to make specified assurances, including commitment to participate in a State interagency task force on child care. Requires each State to distribute at least 90 percent of grant payments from the Secretary of Education to eligible LEAs. Title III: Infant Child Care - Infant Child Care Act of 1989 - Establishes a program of grants to States for infant child care programs. Makes eligible for such programs children under two whose family income does not exceed 150 percent of the LLSIL and who: (1) reside with one or more parents each of whom is working, seeking employment, or attending a job training or educational program; or (2) are receiving, or need to receive, protective services and reside with a parent or parents not described in clause (1). Requires an appropriate State agency to act as the lead agency for such program. Requires a State advisory committee on child care and local advisory councils for such program. Requires that providers provide services to a reasonable mix of children, including those from different socioeconomic backgrounds and those with handicapping conditions. Requires States to use at least 90 percent of their allotment to provide child care services to eligible children on a sliding fee scale basis, using specified funding methods, and giving priority to children whose families have very low income (and who pay no fee). Requires program funds to be distributed equitably among providers of child care services in rural and urban areas. Requires provision of child care services: (1) through contracts or grants to eligible providers, who require schools under their jurisdiction to be in regular session at least 240 days per year; or (2) through grants to local governments that agree to contract with eligible providers. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make planning grants to States under specified conditions. Makes a State ineligible for assistance under this title five years after the Secretary establishes minimum child care standards, unless the State demonstrates that all child care providers in the State required to be licensed and regulated: (1) are so licensed and regulated; (2) satisfy the minimum standards; and (3) are subject to the enforcement provisions referred to in the State plan. Requires each participating State to establish a State advisory committee on child care. Requires such committees to review State licensing authority and to report to the Governor. Sets forth requirements for State-funded resource and referral programs. Establishes the position of the Administrator of Child Care in the Department of Education. Requires the Administrator to: (1) coordinate all Department of Education activities relating to child care with similar activities of other Federal agencies; (2) annually collect and publish State child care standards; (3) evaluate activities funded under this title; (4) act as a clearinghouse for materials related to areas of required annual training and to studies of salaries for child care employees; and (5) provide technical assistance to States. Sets forth Federal enforcement provisions. Sets the Federal share of program costs at 80 percent (or 85 percent if a State makes a required demonstration of compliance throughout a fiscal year). Establishes the National Advisory Committee on Child Care Standards. Requires the Committee to: (1) review Federal policies with respect to child care services; (2) submit to the Secretary proposed minimum standards; and (3) develop and make available model requirements for resource and referral agencies. Sets forth guidelines for minimum child care standards. Terminates the Committee 90 days after the Secretary establishes such standards. Makes applicable to this title specified provisions of the Head Start Act relating to nondiscrimination and restrictions on sectarian activities. Provides for preservation of parental rights and responsibilities."
