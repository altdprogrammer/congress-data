  "summary": {
    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1989-11-20", 
    "text": "International Narcotics Control Act of 1989 - Declares that the Congress finds that: (1) it is crucial to international antidrug efforts that funds be made available to provide alternative sources of income for individuals in major coca producing countries who are dependent on illicit drug production, as well as for eradication, enforcement, rehabilitation, treatment, and education programs in such countries; and (2) the United States and other major donor countries should provide increased economic assistance to major coca producing countries which have taken steps to attack illicit coca production by methods which reduce the flow of cocaine to the world market. Urges the Director of National Drug Control Policy to submit to the Congress a plan which addresses such needs. Urges the President to include such findings and the following issues on the formal agenda of the meeting between the President and the Governments of Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru in February 1990: (1) initiatives to expand antidrug efforts in the Andean region; (2) debt-for-drug exchanges that forgive Andean bilateral debt held by the United States and other creditor countries in return for commitments to use the savings in debt service for antidrug programs; and (3) efforts to halt the transfer of arms, precursor chemicals, and communications equipment and technology from legitimate sources to drug trafficking organizations. Requires the President to report to the Congress on the outcome of such meeting and to submit supplemental budget requests for FY 1990 and 1991 as may be necessary to cover the U.S. share of additional assistance for the Andean antidrug strategy. Authorizes the President to make funds for foreign military financing under the Arms Export Control Act and international military education and training under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 available to provide defense articles and services and international military education and training to Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Earmarks specified amounts of such assistance for narcotics law enforcement training and interdiction activities and procurement of defense articles by enforcement agencies in such countries. Reduces such amounts by the amounts provided for military assistance to such countries under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1990. Makes such countries eligible only if they maintain democratic governments and their law enforcement agencies do not engage in human rights violations. Requires the President to report to specified congressional committees prior to obligating such funds. Provides for human rights reporting on such countries. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to require the Special Defense Acquisition Fund to be used to acquire defense articles for narcotics control purposes. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to transfer excess defense articles to any country: (1) which is a major illicit drug producing country in Latin American and the Caribbean with a democratic government; and (2) whose armed forces do not engage in human rights violations. Requires such countries to ensure that such articles will be used only in support of anti-narcotics activities. Limits the aggregate value of articles to be transferred to a country in any fiscal year. Permits such transfers only if: (1) the articles are drawn from existing Department of Defense (DOD) stocks; (2) funds available to DOD for the procurement of defense equipment are not expended in connection with such transfers; and (3) the President determines that such transfers will not have an adverse impact on the military readiness of the United States. Permits such transfers without cost to the recipient country. Requires the President to notify specified congressional committees prior to transferring such articles. Waives certain prohibitions on the provision of assistance to countries in default on loan payments to the United States with respect to narcotics-related assistance for FY 1990 for major illicit drug producing countries. Limits the amount of FY 1990 international narcotics control assistance to be made available for Mexico. Permits excess assistance to Mexico only if specified congressional committees are notified. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) President Salinas should be supported in his willingness to end narcotics-related corruption in the Mexican Government; (2) Mexico should conclude prosecutions for the murders and torture of certain Drug Enforcement Administration agents and make progress in the prosecution of Felix-Gallardo; (3) Mexico should demonstrate its commitment to cooperating fully in anti-narcotics activities by entering into negotiations with the United States on over-flight and hot pursuit operations, participation of U.S. law enforcement agencies in narcotics interdiction operations, and U.S. requests for access to bank records and requests for verification of eradication statistics; and (4) the Mexican people should be supported in efforts to rid their country of illicit narcotics, bribery and corruption, and electoral fraud. Waives annual certification procedures with respect to FY 1990 assistance to major drug transit countries if the President certifies that: (1) certain provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with regard to money laundering do not apply to such a country; (2) such country was previously a major illicit drug producing country but has effectively eliminated drug production during the preceding two years; and (3) such country is cooperating fully with the United States or has taken certain steps with respect to narcotics control. Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. trade policy should be coordinated with U.S. narcotics control objectives, particularly with respect to the International Coffee Agreement. Commends the President for reviewing whether: (1) the International Coffee Agreement negotiations should be resumed; and (2) the trade benefits provided in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act should be extended to the major coca producing countries of Latin America. Authorizes the President to release Bolivia, Colombia, or Peru from obligations to the U.S. Government of payments on U.S. loans if the President determines that such countries are participating in programs to reduce the flow of cocaine to the United States in accordance with a formal agreement. Provides for congressional review of such agreements before such releases take effect. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the proposal for the promotion of a multilateral anti-narcotics force for the Western Hemisphere should be endorsed; and (2) the United States should work through multilateral organizations to determine the feasibility, and assist in the establishment, of such force. Urges the President to: (1) seek agreement by relevant foreign countries, especially NATO countries and members of the Warsaw Pact, to join with the United States in halting weapons transfers to narcotics traffickers in Latin America; and (2) improve the coordination of U.S. efforts to track the flow of such weapons to international narcotics traffickers and to prevent illegal shipments from the United States. Calls upon the President to direct the U.S. representative to INTERPOL to urge such organization to study the feasibility of establishing an international database on the flow of the types of weapons acquired illegally by international narcotics traffickers. Requires the President to report to the Congress on such actions. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to raise the limit on the amount of rewards for information concerning international terrorism. Provides that such amendment shall not take effect if the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 is enacted before this Act and makes the same amendment. Exempts assistance for narcotics control crop substitution activities from a prohibition on the use of funds to support the production of any agricultural commodity in a foreign country which would compete with a similar U.S. commodity. Makes technical amendments to provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 concerning international narcotics control. Authorizes appropriations for international narcotics control assistance. Requires countries receiving such assistance to bear an appropriate share of the costs for any activity for which assistance is provided. Makes technical amendments to the Narcotics Control Trade Act."
