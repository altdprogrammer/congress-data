    "text": "Amends the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to authorize the exchange of certain Federal lands in California and Nevada for lands owned by the city of Los Angeles, California. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to immediately complete negotiations for the exchange of lands, execute the exchange, and report to specified congressional committees. Provides for the filing of legal descriptions and maps of lands exchanged and the right-of-way corridor by the city of Los Angeles with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, who shall file such information with the designated congressional committees. Makes such legal descriptions and maps available for public inspection. Provides that the values of the lands to be exchanged shall be equal or equalized, with exceptions. Reserves to the United States the option to purchase or reacquire by exchange of Federal land the lands acquired by the city of Los Angeles pursuant to this exchange in Steptoe Valley, White Pine County, Nevada. Requires the city of Los Angeles and the Secretary of Agriculture to immediately execute an agreement which shall establish a trust fund for the purpose of acquiring lands for addition to Forest Service Region V of Southern California. Directs the City of Los Angeles to administer such trust fund. Requires the city of Los Angeles to pay specified sums into the trust fund annually. Directs that certain lands acquired by the city of Los Angeles in the vicinity of Lopez Canyon in Los Angeles County, California, shall not be used for disposal of municipal waste. Directs that certain lands acquired by the Secretary of Agriculture in the vicinity of Bouquet Canyon in Los Angeles County, California, shall be managed in a manner which will protect the water quality of Bouquet Reservoir. Prohibits the Forest Service from allowing the construction or operation of any facility on said acquired lands which may adversely affect the water quality of Bouquet Reservoir. Declares that the Sunrise Wilderness Study Area has been adequately studied for wilderness designation and is no longer subject to the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior manage such Area in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such area for preservation as wilderness. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain lands to the National Park System as an addition to the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Withdraws such lands, subject to valid existing rights, from: (1) disposition under the public land laws; (2) entry or appropriation under U.S. mining laws; (3) the operation of U.S. mineral leasing laws; and (4) the operation of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Reserves a right-of-way corridor along the existing Navajo-McCullough electrical transmission line, to be designated and administered by the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes the Secretary to grant rights-of-way for non-Federal electric transmission lines. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to accept title to any non-Federal lands in Nevada which are donated pursuant to a specified Trust Agreement. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations on a funding participation agreement with Nevada, Arizona, and any other affected parties for construction of the Colorado River bridge crossing at Black Canyon and to report to specified congressional committees on the status of such negotiations."
