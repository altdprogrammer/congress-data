    "text": "Lake Champlain Special Designation Act of 1990 - Amends the Clean Water Act to include Lake Champlain, New York and Vermont, in the clean lakes demonstration program. Establishes within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a Lake Champlain Program Office. Requires the EPA Administrator, acting through the Office Director, to establish a Federal water pollution prevention, control, and restoration program. Establishes within EPA a Management Conference to: (1) monitor activities related to the management of Lake Champlain; and (2) advise the Director on the implementation of this Act and to carry out other assigned duties. Requires the Management Conference to: (1) make recommendations to any commission related to the Lake; (2) make recommendations to the Administrator and the Director on the need for additional agreements between New York and Vermont; (3) contact the officials conducting studies and programs concerning the Lake; and (4) coordinate such studies and programs. Requires the Management Conference to develop a five-year pollution prevention, control, and restoration plan. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires the Director, acting through the Management Conference, to establish Lake Champlain public participation and local government education programs and a multi-disciplinary research program. Directs the Management Conference to appoint a Technical Advisory Committee. Authorizes the Administrator, upon the request of the Governors of New York and Vermont, to issue a grant to such States for the implementation of the pollution prevention plan. Sets forth grant limitations. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to designate the Lake Champlain Basin as a special project area under the Agricultural Conservation Program. Increases to 15 percent the technical reimbursement from the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service to carry out such project. Makes agricultural enterprises operating in the Basin which are sources of nonpoint source pollution eligible to receive technical and financial assistance. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, to consult with the Management Conference in carrying out historic preservation and natural landmarks programs in the Basin. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop an integrated geographic information system of the Basin; and (2) convert all recording sites in the Basin to continuous monitoring stations and establish additional stations. Requires the Secretary, acting through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to implement a salmonid fisheries restoration and development program. Directs the Director of the Service to continue the existing level of hatchery production of salmonid fish conducted through the Service to assist New York and Vermont in maintaining salmonid fish culture and healthy salmonid fisheries. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Service, to conduct a wildlife species and habitat assessment survey in the Basin. Authorizes appropriations."
