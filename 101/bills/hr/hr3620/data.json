States that a tenant who would otherwise be considered the same \"person\" as the landlord shall be eligible for payments only to the extent that such tenant would be considered the same \"person\" as the landlord under regulations in place prior to enactment of this Act. Amends such Act, effective for the 1990 crop, to make a cash tenant who makes a management but not labor contribution to the farming operation ineligible for agricultural program benefits unless such tenant also makes an equipment contribution."
