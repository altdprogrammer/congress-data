Requires each person who requests or receives a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from an agency or requests or receives from an agency a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan to file with such agency specified written declarations concerning prohibited payments. Requires the head of each agency to compile such declarations and to submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House a semiannual report containing a compilation of the declarations received. Directs that such report, including the compilation, be available for public inspection.
