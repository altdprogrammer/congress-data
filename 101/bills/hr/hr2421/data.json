    "text": "Older American Volunteer Program Amendments of 1989 - Amends title II (Older American Volunteer Programs) of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to increase the amount of stipends or allowances under the Foster Grandparent Program. Revises provisions relating to individuals who are not low-income persons serving as volunteers without stipends under such program. Prohibits the Director of the ACTION agency (the Director) from coercing any volunteer applicant or grant or contract recipient to engage in specified conduct with respect to such unpaid volunteer positions. Authorizes the Director to make grants or contracts for the following national projects: (1) Retired Senior Volunteers providing literacy services, before- and after-school child care, and respite care to families caring for frail elderly individuals; (2) Foster Grandparents providing services to children with special needs while they attend day care; and (3) Senior Companions providing respite care to families caring for frail elderly individuals. Requires the Director to encourage and facilitate: (1) private organizational efforts to promote National Older American Volunteer Programs; and (2) involvement of older persons as volunteers in such programs. Requires the Director to expend specified funds to ensure that special efforts are made to publicize such programs. Requires the Director to make cost of living adjustments to amounts available for administrative costs of program grants and contracts, and report annually to specified congressional committees on such adjustments. Requires that there be three Deputy Assistant Directors, responsible for the Retired Senior Volunteer, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion programs respectively. Requires them to report directly to the Assistant Director of the ACTION Agency who is responsible for title II Older American Volunteer Programs. Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations for FY 1990 through 1993. Amends the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 to revise provisions, under the Community Services Block Grant Program, relating to partnership agreements addressing the needs of the poor. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to annually: (1) identify new programs for replication under such provisions; and (2) report to specified congressional committees on programs funded and evaluated under such provisions. Makes technical amendments to: (1) the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988; (2) the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974; (3) the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act; and (4) the Missing Children's Assistance Act."
