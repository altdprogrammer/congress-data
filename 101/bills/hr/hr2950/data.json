    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit the manufacture or sale of any part or component intended to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative a vehicle emission device, with exceptions for certain temporary repairs or replacements. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to review, revise, and republish in the Federal Register the guidance for the States for motor vehicle inspection and maintenance programs to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide in ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas for which State implementation plan revisions are required. Specifies that such guidance shall: (1) include provisions with respect to the frequency of inspections, the types of vehicles to be inspected, vehicle maintenance, State audits, inspection methods and procedures, and effective implementation and enforcement; (2) be incorporated into the applicable State implementation plans; and (3) provide the States with flexibility to fashion effective, reasonable, and fair programs for the affected consumer. Requires: (1) each ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment area which, by December 31, 1987, did not attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone or carbon monoxide and which is not in attainment upon enactment of this Act, to promptly adopt, implement and enforce or improve an inspection and maintenance program to reduce in-use emissions from specified motor vehicles; and (2) such program, at a minimum, to comply with the guidance published by the Administrator with respect to adequacy of motor vehicle inspection and maintenance programs. Prohibits waivers for vehicles and components manufactured less than seven model years prior to inspection and, in the case of other vehicles, for costs of $500 or less. Directs that vehicles be rejected where there is evidence of tampering or misfueling until corrections are made. Requires each State to comply with this program within three years. Specifies that: (1) any such program in effect on the effective date of this Act shall continue in effect, but shall promptly be reviewed and modified by the State to conform to the requirements of this Act; and (2) all such programs shall continue in effect until such nonattainment area is redesignated as an area which has attained the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone, carbon monoxide, or both. Revises warranty provisions to make the manufacturer responsible for bearing the cost of repairs if, among other things, a vehicle fails to conform to specified regulations for a period of two years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first (or, in the case of components designed for emission control, five years or 50,000 miles)."
