Requires a merit review process and certain selection criteria for grant recipients. Directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy, within one year, to report to the Congress on: (1) all Federal programs supporting learning technology; (2) recommendations for ensuring that such programs' products are adequately disseminated to teachers and schools; and (3) the extent to which teacher training funded by the NSF and the Department of Education focuses on the use of learning technology. Authorizes appropriations."
