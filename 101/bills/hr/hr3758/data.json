Requires contractual compliance with this Act for each BDRF. Directs each BDRF to notify each police and fire department, and each hospital within closest proximity of such BDRF, of the existence of research efforts conducted with biological agents requiring biosafety levels II, III, or IV. Directs each BDRF to report annually to the Secretary concerning the biological agents, biosafety levels involved, and methods and procedures followed to respond to the release of biological agents into the ecosystem. Requires the Secretary to review and approve each BDRF report and to notify the appropriate police and fire department and hospital of such approval. Requires each BDRF, after receipt of the required approval, to request in writing to meet with representatives of each police and fire department and hospital within closest proximity to such facility. Authorizes the Secretary to cancel or decline the renewal of a contract with a BDRF if he determines that such facility is not in compliance with the requirements of this Act."
