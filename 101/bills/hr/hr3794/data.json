Provides that the chairman of the National Acid Precipitation Task Force shall be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Requires the Task Force to sponsor monitoring and research in Federal agencies and in the scientific community to understand the effects of the emissions control program created by the Clean Air Act on acid precipitation. Directs the Task Force to: (1) undertake cost/benefit analyses of the effects of such program; (2) collect specified information regarding acid deposition; (3) maintain, update, and test models that describe the interaction of emissions with the atmosphere; (4) make a budget recommendation; and (5) report biennially to the Congress and the President on the results of the effects of the emissions control program on acid precipitation. Requires a scientific advisory board to conduct an annual peer review of Task Force research and reports and to make recommendations for the Task Force. Authorizes appropriations."
