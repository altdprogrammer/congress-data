Declares that the purpose of the Committee shall be to increase the overall effectiveness of Federal research and assessment efforts directed toward an understanding of global change. Directs the President to establish an interagency National Global Research Program which shall include: (1) making measurements necessary to document global change; (2) developing quantitative models to facilitate identification and prediction of global environmental trends; and (3) increasing international cooperation in global change research, monitoring, and analysis. Requires the Committee to develop a National Global Change Research Plan to: (1) identify goals, priorities, and approaches for global change research and assessment conducted or funded by the Government; (2) provide for identification and coordination of relevant programs and activities of specified Federal agencies; (3) recommend allocations of Federal funding among such activities; and (4) make recommendations for coordination with activities of other nations and international organizations. Sets forth requirements for: (1) submission of the Plan to the Congress; (2) providing general budgetary guidance to participating Federal agencies on an annual basis; (3) the submission of reports to the President and the Congress; and (4) sunset provisions. Directs the Committee to enter into an agreement under which the National Academy of Sciences shall evaluate the Plan and provide information on future global change research and assessment priorities. Title II: International Programs in Global Change Research - Directs the Secretary of State to initiate discussions with other nations leading toward an international protocol in global change research and assessment, including discussions concerning: (1) the allocation of costs in research and assessment programs; (2) management of such programs; (3) establishment of training centers for scientists from developing nations; and (4) establishment of certain other international projects. Directs the Secretary to initiate discussions with other nations leading toward an international research protocol for environmentally safe energy technologies. Title III: National Climate Program Act Amendments - Amends the National Climate Program Act to: (1) shift responsibility for the National Climate Program from the President to the Committee on Earth Sciences; and (2) incorporate such program within the National Global Change Research Program as a separate coordinating and programmatic unit.
