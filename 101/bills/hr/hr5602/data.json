    "text": "Emergency Middle East Hostilities Cost-Sharing Act - Directs the President to determine whether Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy, or France, which benefit from the security of petroleum supplies afforded by the military mobilization in response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, are adequately supporting such mobilization and other international efforts to resolve the crisis caused by the invasion. Sets forth standards for making such determinations. Requires the President to impose an additional duty on dutiable products and a duty on duty-free products of countries found not to be supporting international efforts in the Middle East. Provides for the termination of such duties."
