    "text": "Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act to provide for the qualifications of Commissioners under the Convention. Makes the qualifications inapplicable to reappointment of Commissioners serving on the date of enactment of this Act. Sets the term of office of Commissioners at three years and limits any individual to two consecutive terms. Excludes from consideration the current term, at enactment of this Act, of any Commissioner in determining eligibility for reappointment. Terminates, on January 1, 1990, the term of each Commissioner who is serving at the time of enactment of this Act. Directs the President, by that date, to complete appointment or reappointment of Commissioners to serve on and after that date. Directs the Secretary of State to pay the necessary travel expenses of U.S. Commissioners, Alternate U.S. Commissioners, and authorized advisors in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations and specified provisions of Federal law. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to reimburse the Secretary of State for such payments. Replaces provisions requiring, on approval of the U.S. Commissioners, payment of actual travel expenses and per diem to members of the advisory committee with provisions authorizing the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State to pay the necessary travel expenses of advisory committee members in accordance with such Regulations and such laws. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1992 to carry out the Act."
