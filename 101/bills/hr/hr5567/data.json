Specifies that up to a specified amount of such economic assistance should be used to provide assistance for Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru for: (1) administration of justice programs; (2) protection of judges, other government officials, and members of the press against narco-terrorist attacks; and (3) training, technical assistance, and equipment for the Office of Special Investigations and the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights in Colombia. Extends authority for administration of justice programs under such Act. Authorizes appropriations for military and law enforcement assistance for Andean countries under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). Conditions such aid on: (1) the country having a democratic government; and (2) the armed forces and law enforcement agencies of the country not engaging in a consistent pattern of gross human rights violations. Specifies: (1) authorized uses of funds for law enforcement (anti-narcotics) training and equipment, subject to certain monetary limitations (but sets forth conditions under which such assistance may be increased); and (2) forms of assistance subject to limitation.
