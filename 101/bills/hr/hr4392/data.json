Removes the Secretary of the Army from membership on the Board. Prohibits the Board from granting an application to establish a foreign trade zone unless the Board finds that the proposed zone will meet specified public economic interest criteria. Requires each application to address: (1) the ability of the applicant to maintain operations in the zone; and (2) the customs and tax benefits that will accrue to the applicant as a result of the zone's operation. Places upon the applicant the burden of proof that such zone will meet the public economic interest criteria. Sets forth specified procedures for the granting of applications for a foreign trade zone. Provides for Board review of such grants every seven years. Authorizes the Board to revoke grants that do not meet the requirements of this Act."
