Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the Congress, within one year of this Act's enactment, on the feasibility of linking the Department of Health and Human Services' treatment outcome research information with such information collected by other Federal departments; (2) disseminate research findings and educate providers in the application of such research; (3) develop on the basis of such research, treatment-specific or condition-specific practice guidelines and models for their use; (4) initiate, by 1991, a project to apply such guidelines to at least three clinical treatments or conditions that account for a significant portion of Medicare (title XVIII of the Act) expenditures and have a significant variation in the frequency or type of treatment provided; and (5) appoint an advisory council to provide the Secretary with assistance in research-related activities. Authorizes appropriations for such research-related activities through FY 1994."
