(Current law authorizes payments from sums received for violations of the Magnuson Act.) Amends the Magnuson Act to include among such purposes: (1) payment of a reward in connection with a violation of the Magnuson Act or any other fishery resource law enforced by the Secretary (currently, only in connection with a violation of the Magnuson Act); (2) payment of expenses of investigations and civil or criminal enforcement proceedings; (3) payment of liens or mortgages against any forfeited property; (4) payment of claims of parties having an interest in property disposed of under provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to seizure and summary sale; and (5) reimbursement of any Federal or State agency for services performed, or personnel, equipment, or facilities utilized under an agreement entered into by the Secretary."
