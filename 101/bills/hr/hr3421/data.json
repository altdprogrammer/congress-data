    "text": "Directs the Attorney General to classify anabolic steroids as schedule II substances under the Controlled Substances Act, except that prescriptions for such substances may be refilled without restriction. Specifies that an anabolic steroid which is expressly intended for administration through implants to cattle or other nonhuman species and which has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for such purpose shall not be placed in schedule II. Provides that any person who prescribes, dispenses, or distributes such steroid for human use shall be considered to have prescribed, dispensed, or distributed a schedule II substance. Defines \"anabolic steroid\" as any drug that is chemically related to the male hormone testosterone or any other hormonal substance which promotes or purports to promote muscle growth, including specified substances. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention to develop and support innovative demonstration programs designed to identify and deter the improper use or abuse of anabolic steroids by students, especially students in secondary schools. Establishes the Interagency Coordinating Council on the Abuse of Anabolic Steroids."
