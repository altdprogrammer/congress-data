    "text": "Amends the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to change the name of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to the Federated States of Micronesia. Requires funds for water resources research institutes to be used only for the reimbursement of direct cost expenditures incurred for the conduct of the water resources research program. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an evaluation of each institute every five years to determine if it qualifies for further support. (Currently the Secretary must make such determination every four years.) Extends the authorization of appropriations for the grant program from FY 1989 through 1995. Repeals a provision which allows the Secretary to approve alternative matching fund requirements with respect to grants for water resources research deemed to be in the national interest. Decreases the amount authorized to be appropriated for such research and extends the authorization of appropriations through FY 1995. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995 only for the reimbursement of the direct cost expenses of additional research by institutes which focus on water problems and issues of a regional or interstate nature beyond those of concern only to a single State and which relates to specific program priorities identified jointly by the Secretary and the institutes. Requires such funds when appropriated to be matched on a not less than dollar-for-dollar basis by non-Federal sources. Authorizes appropriations to extend the technology grant program from FY 1990 through 1995. Extends the authorization of appropriations for Ogallala Aquifer research and development and related High Plains water resources projects through FY 1995. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements to carry out water resources research, development, and demonstration projects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995 for entering into such contracts or agreements."
