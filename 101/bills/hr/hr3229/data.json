    "date": "1989-09-07", 
    "text": "Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations for the safe transportation of hazardous materials in domestic and foreign commerce (including route designations). Cites the area in which Federal regulations preempt State and local hazardous materials transportation requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations for dispute resolution among the States or local governments regarding hazardous materials highway route designations. Permits States or local governments to petition for judicial review of the dispute resolution decision. Grants the Secretary discretion to either adopt or reject hazardous materials transportation standards adopted by international bodies according to the Secretary's perception of the public interest. Prohibits a person from representing that: (1) a container for the transportation of hazardous materials is safe and in compliance with the requirements of this Act if it is not; or (2) a hazardous material is present in such a container, motor vehicle, rail freight car, aircraft, or vessel if such material is not present. Prohibits a person from altering: (1) any label or description on any document required by this Act; or (2) any container, motor vehicle, rail freight car, aircraft, or vessel used for the transportation of such hazardous materials. Requires motor carriers of specified hazardous materials (including radioactive materials) to possess a valid safety permit issued by the Secretary authorizing the carrier to engage in such transportation. Cites circumstances under which such permits may be suspended or revoked. Amends the definition of radioactive materials to state that it does not include any materials determined by the Secretary to be of such low radioactivity that they do not pose a significant hazard when transported. Revises the scope of civil penalties to impose liability for violations of orders issued under this Act. Declares that no U.S. employee shall be personally liable for any civil penalty arising from the performance of such employee's duties, for which the employee is not otherwise liable. Prescribes guidelines under which the preemption of State laws conflicting with this Act shall be determined. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1991."
