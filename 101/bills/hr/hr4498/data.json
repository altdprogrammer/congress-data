    "text": "Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) operate Glen Canyon Dam and take other reasonable mitigation measures to protect, mitigate adverse impacts to, and improve the condition of the environmental, cultural, and recreational resources of Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreational Area; (2) develop interim operating procedures for Glen Canyon Dam in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, specified State Governors, and Indian tribes and with the full participation of the general public, including environmental organizations, the recreational industry, and contractors for the purchase of Federal power produced at Glen Canyon Dam; (3) implement such procedures pending development of long-term operating procedures; and (4) establish and implement long-term monitoring requirements. Subjects such operating procedures to the water storage and delivery functions of Glen Canyon Dam pursuant to laws relating to regulation of the Colorado River. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to deviate from such interim operating procedures to: (1) comply with requirements under this Act; (2) respond to hydrologic extremes or power system operating emergencies; or (3) further reduce adverse impacts on resources downstream. Directs the Secretary, within three years after this Act's enactment, to complete the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and the final Glen Canyon Dam Impact Statement as required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Directs the Comptroller General to audit the costs and benefits to water and power users and to recreational and environmental values of management policies and operating procedures identified in the Studies and Impact Statement and report the results of such audit to the Secretary and the Congress. Directs the Secretary to implement the long-term operating procedures for the Dam, based on the Studies and the Statement and audit, alone or in combination with other reasonable mitigation measures, and to submit the Studies and the Statement and the long-term operating procedures to the Congress. Prohibits such long-term operating procedures from interfering with the primary water storage and delivery functions of the Glen Canyon Dam pursuant to laws relating to regulation of the Colorado River. Amends the Colorado River Storage Project Act to prohibit the Secretary from operating the hydroelectric powerplant at the Dam in a manner which causes significant and avoidable adverse effects on resources of the Grand Canyon National Park or the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be interpreted as modifying or amending the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 with regard to the operation of the Glen Canyon Dam. Authorizes appropriations."
