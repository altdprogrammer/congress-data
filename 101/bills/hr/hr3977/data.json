Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State should enter into negotiations with the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to conclude an international agreement to: (1) conserve and protect Antarctica and its associated ecosystems; (2) prohibit or ban mineral resource activities by all parties to the Antarctic treaty; (3) grant Antarctica special protective status as a land of science for wilderness protection, international cooperation, and scientific research; (4) ensure that all scientific investigation relating to geological processes and structures is made available to the international scientific community; and (5) include other comprehensive measures for the protection of the Antarctic environment. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any international agreement relating to Antarctica that is submitted to the Senate for ratification should be consistent with the purposes of this Act. Deems violations of this Act to be violations of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act. Makes persons who violate this Act ineligible for: (1) U.S. mining claims; and (2) U.S. mining patents or leases or mineral or geothermal leases. Authorizes appropriations."
