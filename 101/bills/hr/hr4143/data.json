    "text": "Zuni Land Conservation Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Zuni Indian Tribe of New Mexico to jointly formulate a resource development plan for the Zuni Indian Reservation, including plans for: (1) sustained development of renewable resources; (2) a program of watershed rehabilitation; (3) a computerized system of resource management and monitoring; (4) the funding and training for Zuni professional positions to implement the overall plan; (5) cooperative programs with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other private or public agencies to provide technical assistance; and (6) the identification and acquisition of lands necessary for sustained resource development. Establishes the Zuni Indian Resource Development Trust Fund within the Treasury. Makes the Secretary the trustee of such Fund. Permits Trust Fund expenditures only for: (1) any loans, debts, or expenses incurred by the Tribe for the purchase of land or for obtaining or defending rights of access to a specified area; (2) the formulation of a Zuni resource development plan; (3) all costs, attorneys fees, and expenses incurred by the Tribe in the prosecution of certain civil actions; and (4) all invoices submitted to the Tribe for which proper vouchers have been received prior to September 30, 1990, and subsequently approved by the Secretary. States that all sums paid under this Act shall be offset against any judgment entered in favor of the Tribe in docket numbers 327-81L and 224-84L, but not against any judgment entered in docket number 161-79L, of the U.S. Court of Claims. Authorizes appropriations to establish the Trust Fund. Amends Federal law declaring specified lands in Arizona part of the Zuni Indian Reservation to make specific tracts of additional private lands in an area known as Zuni Heaven available for acquisition by the Secretary or the Tribe for inclusion as part of the Reservation."
