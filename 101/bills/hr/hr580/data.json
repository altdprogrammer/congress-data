Amends the Federal Salary Act to require the President to transmit to the Congress, within a specified time period, recommendations for rates of pay of Members of Congress and legislative and judicial employees. (Currently such recommendations are included in the Federal budget.) Prohibits the House of Representatives and the Senate from considering any bill or joint resolution carrying an appropriation for compensation of Members of Congress for any fiscal year if it carries an appropriation, or a limitation of appropriations, for any other purpose. Requires a recorded vote on such bill or resolution."
