    "text": "Preventive Health Measures Act of 1989 - Title I: Preventive Health Amendments to Public Health Service Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations from FY 1990 through 1992 for the provision of grants for preventive health services other than immunizations. Includes programs for the deterrence of smoking and substance abuse by children and adolescents among the preventive health service programs receiving grants. Authorizes appropriations from FY 1990 through 1992 for the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant program. Authorizes States to use grant amounts on demonstration projects for the inclusion of preventive health courses in the curriculum of schools that train health professionals. Title II: Preventive Health Amendment to Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant - Amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) of the Social Security Act to increase authorized appropriations under such title from FY 1990 through 1992. Title III: Preventive Health Amendments for the Elderly under Medicare and under Internal Revenue Code - Subtitle A: Medicare Coverage of Additional Preventive Services - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to cover a beneficiary's annual routine eye and hearing examination and a diabetic beneficiary's annual podiatric foot examination. Subtitle B: Medicare Coverage of Adult Day Care Services - Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program to cover 125 days of adult day care per year provided to a clinically impaired individual who, but for the provision of such care, would require the level of care provided in a hospital or nursing facility. Requires that covered adult day care programs provide such care pursuant to a written plan of care which is established and periodically reviewed by the program's multidisciplinary team of personnel which includes at least: (1) a physician; (2) a registered professional nurse and a social worker; (3) a consultant with physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology skills; and (4) as needed, a dietitian. Sets forth additional program requirements. Imposes a coinsurance amount of five dollars per day of adult day care on beneficiaries, but no deductible. Provides for State participation in establishing adult day care program requirements and certifying the compliance of such programs with those requirements. Subtitle C: Medicare Coverage of Increased Home Care - Includes periodic chore services performed in the home of an aged, blind, or disabled adult when such individual is not able to perform such services and respite care services provided for no more than 52 days per year by persons who have successfully completed a homemaker/home health aide training program as covered home health care. Covers home health services provided in adult day care centers. Subtitle D: Income Tax Credit for Maintaining Households Which Include Dependents Who Have Attained Age 65 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a $250 tax credit to individuals who maintain households which include dependents who have attained age 65. Title IV: Further Preventive Health Amendments to Internal Revenue Code - Allows a tax credit of ten percent of the expenses a taxpayer incurs for a weight reduction or exercise program or a program to stop smoking. Increases excise taxes on cigarettes. Establishes the Health Maintenance Trust Fund into which certain cigarette tax revenues shall be deposited for use in: (1) implementing the amendments made by title I of this Act; (2) covering the decrease in Treasury revenues resulting from this Act's health maintenance expense credit; and (3) implementing programs discouraging cigarette smoking as well as disease prevention and health promotion programs unrelated to smoking."
