    "text": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to remove the authority for certain Members of Congress to use excess campaign funds for personal purposes. Prohibits a multicandidate political committee controlled by a Member of the House of Representatives from making contributions to an authorized committee of any other individual who is a candidate for the House of Representatives. States that any contribution to a candidate for the House of Representatives may only be used to defray election expenses, except that not more than $100,000 may be retained for any lawful purpose. Requires the treasurer of each principal campaign committee of such candidate: (1) to pay all such expenses not later than 90 days after the general election; and (2) not later than 270 days after the general election, to submit to the Secretary of the Treasury, refund pro rata to contributors, or contribute to any national or State committee of a political party, any amount not so used or retained. Directs the Federal Election Commission to conduct random audits of the accounts of principal campaign committees of candidates for the House of Representatives."
