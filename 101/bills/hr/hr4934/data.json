    "text": "Homeless Children's Education Act of 1990 - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to revise provisions for grants for State activities for the education of homeless children and youth. Makes biennial (rather than annual as at present) certain data-gathering and reporting duties of each State's Coordinator of Education of Homeless Children and Youth (the State Coordinator). Directs the State Coordinator to: (1) monitor the progress of homeless children and youth who participate in exemplary programs to address their needs in schools; and (2) evaluate applications for grants to local education agencies (LEAs) for local activities for education of the homeless. Requires State plans to provide for: (1) minimizing disruption of the education of homeless children and youth caused by transportation issues and enrollment delays relating to guardianship issues or requirements for immunization, residency, or documentation; (2) allowing them to attend school prior to the receipt of required documentation; and (3) expediting the transfer of records and documents. Allows, under State plan requirements, a homeless child or youth to continue at his or her school or LEA of origin for up to two years (currently, only for the remainder of the school year), as an alternative to enrollment in a school in the LEA within whose jurisdiction he or she is now living. Includes preschool programs among the comparable educational services to which the homeless are entitled under State plan requirements. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for State activities. Establishes a new program of grants for local activities for the education of homeless children and youths. Directs the Secretary of Education to consider the State Coordinator's ranking of the application in approving it for a grant. Authorizes appropriations. Revises the exemplary grants program to include: (1) the preschool needs of the homeless; and (2) nonprofit organizations as grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations."
