    "text": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Multiyear Authorization Act of 1989 - Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for specified activities relating to: (1) research and development; (2) space flight, control, and data communications; (3) construction of facilities; (4) research and program management; and (5) the Inspector General. Permits appropriations for the first two numbered categories to be used for certain items of a capital nature (other than land acquisition) required for the performance of research and development contracts, and for grants to nonprofit educational and research organizations to augment their research facilities. Prohibits the use of these funds for the construction of any major facility whose estimated cost exceeds $500,000, unless the Administrator of NASA notifies specified congressional committees. Authorizes use of funds from one or more of the numbered categories, subject to limitations, for scientific consultations or extraordinary expenses, for facilities construction, repair, or modification, and for unforeseen programmatic facility project needs. Permits reprogramming of funds for facilities construction, subject to conditions outlined in this Act. Authorizes certain fund transfers and makes available specified funds for the construction and modification of laboratories and other installations. Requires the Administrator to notify specified congressional committees of the nature, cost, and need for such construction before expending the funds in question. Prohibits, until 30 days following congressional receipt of the Administrator's full explanation, the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for any program: (1) not authorized by the Congress; or (2) in excess of the amount actually authorized for the particular program. Authorizes and encourages the Administrator to use up to a specified amount of funds appropriated for orbiter production by a specified law to procure shuttle structural spare parts. Requires the Administrator to distribute research and development funds geographically in order to provide the broadcast practicable participation in NASA programs. Directs the Administrator to award to a domestic firm a contract that, under the use of competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm, if certain conditions exist. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to add to the functions of the Administration those of: (1) seeking and encouraging the fullest commercial use of space; and (2) encouraging and providing for Federal Government use of commercially provided space services and hardware. Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act to authorize appropriations to carry out the Act for FY 1990. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the activities of the National Space Council. Requires the Council to reimburse other agencies for at least half of the personnel compensation costs of individuals detailed to it. Provides for terms and conditions for employment of staff, experts, and consultants. Amends Federal law relating to pay rates to add the Executive Secretary of the Council to the list of positions to which level III of the Executive Schedule applies. Requests the Council to initiate a review of U.S. launch policy. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should take specified actions with respect to the International Space Year (ISY), including: (1) declaring a World Space Congress to be convened in 1992; and (2) directing NASA to continue to develop ISY activities with a primary emphasis on Mission to Planet Earth. Directs the Administrator to submit to specified congressional committees certain reports relating to the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor. Declares it to be U.S. policy to use the space shuttle: (1) for purposes that require the presence of man or the unique capabilities of the shuttle; or (2) when other compelling circumstances exist, including those related to national security or foreign policy. States that the policy does not preclude carrying secondary payloads that do not require the presence of man if consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to submit to the Congress a plan for implementing the policy. Directs the Administrator to: (1) review proposed manned space flight missions with regard to identifying the human factors knowledge base necessary and developing a schedule of when specified components of information will need to be acquired or developed; (2) develop a strategic plan for life sciences research and technology development, including a crew certification plan and a life sciences implementation plan; and (3) verify the physiological and technical feasibility of the life sciences implementation plan. Establishes within the Department of Commerce an Office of Space Commerce. Directs the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of NASA to continue to jointly conduct a National Aero-Space Plane program to develop a long-range hypersonic cruise research flight vehicle. Prescribes the respective responsibilities of the Secretary and the Administrator. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to develop and submit to the Congress a management plan that includes goals, tasks, schedules, and resource procurement strategies. Authorizes the Administrator to use up to five percent of the funds provided for the Small Business Innovation Research Program for program management and promotional activities. Prohibits use of Program funds for travel or civil service salaries. Authorizes the Administrator to use up to specified sums of previously appropriated funds for: (1) continued development of an extended duration orbiter; and (2) space transportation system requirements. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 1988 to require the Administrator to support a space grant fellowship program at the undergraduate as well as the graduate level. Declares that: (1) no civil Space Station authorized under this Act may be used to carry or place in orbit any nuclear weapon or any other weapon of mass destruction, or to station any such weapon in space in any other manner; and (2) this civil Space Station may be used only for peaceful purposes."
