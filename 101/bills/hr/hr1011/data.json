Directs the Commission to study the effects of such fires on: (1) the current and future economy of affected communities; (2) the availability of sufficient timber supplies to meet future industry needs; (3) fish and wildlife habitats; (4) recreation in the affected areas; (5) watershed and water quality protection plans in effect within National Forest System lands; (6) ecosystems in the areas; (7) management plans of the affected National Forest System lands; (8) national parks; (9) Bureau of Land Management public lands; (10) wilderness; and (11) the biodiversity of affected areas. Requires the Commission to report to the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, by December 1, 1991, concerning the future management of National Forest System lands, national parks, Bureau of Land Management public lands, and community redevelopment activities and programs. Directs the Secretaries to submit such report to specified congressional committees. Terminates the Commission 90 days after it submits its report to the Secretaries. Title II: Forest Firefighting Planning and Cooperation - Requires annual reports to the Congress, by the Secretary of Agriculture, on the rehabilitation needs of each Forest System Region and, by the Secretary of the Interior, on the rehabilitation needs of the Bureau of Land Management public lands and of each National Park Region resulting from disastrous forest fire damage during the previous year. Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to annually offer training programs to certify volunteers for suppressing forest fires on National Forest System Lands, National Park System lands and Bureau of Land Management public lands. Directs the Secretaries to submit information to the Congress within one year after this Act's enactment on firefighting mobilization plans and presuppression needs for such lands. Compensates volunteer forest firefighters for personal losses and damages incident to their services."
