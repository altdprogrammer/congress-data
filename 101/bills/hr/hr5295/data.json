    "text": "Ancient Forest Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to designate lands for a Pacific Northwest Ancient Forest Reserve System, consisting of Federal and public lands in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California. Includes within the criteria for the System the need for lands for the viability and recovery of the northern spotted owl population. Requires the Ancient Forest to include at least 50 percent of old growth forest ecosystems found in the Douglas Fir Region that are outside of congressionally designated areas (wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers which prohibit commercial timber sales). Prohibits timber harvesting on lands designated as Ancient Forests except for the minimum necessary for the protection of old growth forest ecosystems. Requires that any timber harvest in the old growth forest ecosystems outside of Ancient Forests but within the Douglas Fir Region be managed using the specified techniques of a New Forestry Program. Requires the Secretaries to establish an Ancient Forest Research Program on old growth forest ecosystems. Directs the President to establish a permanent Ancient Forest Scientific Committee to report to the Secretaries and certain congressional committees on specified aspects of programs and activities established under this Act. Mandates for FY 1991 through 1993 the minimum board feet per year the Secretaries must offer for sale from national forest lands within the Douglas Fir Region and other lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management within such Region. Prohibits the sale of timber in certain areas. Increases from 25 percent to 50 percent for a five-year period the amounts paid by the Secretary of Agriculture to States for their counties under Federal law with respect to national forests in the Douglas Fir Region. Sets forth for a five-year period the method by which Oregon and California land-grant funds paid by the Secretary of the Interior shall be distributed to such countries. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Forest Service's State and private forestry programs, to establish a special initiative to improve the productivity on State, county, and private lands in counties that include lands within the Douglas Fir Region. Requires the Secretaries to establish a national community assistance task force to oversee assistance to rural communities in those counties that include lands that are parts of the Douglas Fir Region and to establish local task forces to assist communities and help displaced workers. Requires the Secretaries to establish a program to improve the condition of Federal forest lands in the Douglas Fir Region, with hiring preference given to local workers. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to specified congressional committees on consolidation of the Bureau of Land Management's Oregon and California lands through exchange, purchase, or donation. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 with respect to old growth forest ecosystems. Directs the Secretaries to prepare and submit to the Congress a nationwide inventory of old growth forest ecosystems on national forests and public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management."
