    "text": "Amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act to require that business-education-labor partnership program funds be awarded on a competitive basis solely for technology and technical education programs, including: (1) apprenticeships and internships in industry; (2) new equipment provision; (3) cash contributions to technology and technical education programs; (4) teacher internships or teacher training; and (5) employer entry into the classroom. Requires States to: (1) encourage small business participation by providing 60 percent of funds for each such partnership with small business; (2) give preference to partnerships that coordinate with local chambers of commerce; (3) provide incentives for coordination of partnerships with related efforts; and (4) ensure equitable distribution of funds between partnership programs in rural and in urban areas. Directs the Secretary of Education to prescribe policies, including allowable expenses, for technology and technical education activities under such partnership programs."
