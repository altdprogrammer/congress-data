    "text": "Telephone Advertising Regulation Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the use of: (1) any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other electronic device to send unsolicited advertisements to the machine of any person whose number is listed as that of a party who objects to the receipt of such unsolicited advertisements; (2) any automatic dialing system to make unsolicited calls to a party listed as objecting to such unsolicited calls, to emergency telephone lines, and to paging or cellular telephones; (3) any such machine, device, or system which does not comply with specified technical standards; and (4) a computer or other electronic device to send an unsolicited advertisement via a facsimile machine unless the person sending the advertisement notes the date and time it is sent and the identity and telephone number of the business initiating the message. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to: (1) compare and evaluate alternative mechanisms for establishing a national clearinghouse to compile a list of telephone subscribers who have submitted objections; (2) make such list available; and (3) select the most cost effective means of carrying out this Act, while providing for the recovery of costs. Directs each common carrier providing telephone exchange service to afford its subscribers the opportunity to provide notification of objections to the receipt of such unsolicited calls or advertisements. Specifies that regulations under this Act shall include: (1) a delineation of methods by which a subscriber shall be informed by a common carrier of the right to give or revoke a notification of objections; (2) a prohibition against charging residential subscribers for giving or revoking such notification or for being carried on such list; and (3) a prohibition against the use of such list for purposes other than compliance with State or Federal law. Sets forth technical and procedural standards for such systems. Exempts from such standards facsimile machines that do not have the capacity for automatic dialing and transmission and that are incapable of operation through an interface with a computer. Authorizes States to impose more restrictive requirements or regulations with respect to such systems."
