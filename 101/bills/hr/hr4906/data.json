    "text": "Requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish criteria and standards and to implement a voluntary accreditation program with respect to laboratory analysis of lead in paint films, soil, and dust. Provides funding for such program through the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Directs the Administrator to conduct research and report to the Congress on methods for evaluating merging products and techniques for detecting lead in paint films and dust, including x-ray fluorescent devices, on-site chemical spot testers, and laboratory methods. Requires the Institute to establish criteria and minimum performance standards to be used in such evaluation. Requires the Administrator to conduct research on the short and long-term efficacy of lead abatement and in-place management techniques for housing based on subsequent levels of lead in dust and in occupants' blood. Requires the Administrator to conduct research on the safety, efficacy, durability, and other performance properties of products for encapsulating or stripping lead-based paint. Directs the Institute to establish performance criteria and standards for encapsulants and strippers. Directs the Administrator to conduct a long-term research study to establish the sources of lead exposure for children with blood lead levels greater than ten micrograms per deciliter. Directs the Administrator to sponsor public education and outreach efforts to increase awareness of the scope and severity of lead poisoning from household sources and the need for abatement and management actions. Authorizes appropriations."
