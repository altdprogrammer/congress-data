Places a moratorium on changes in staffing levels at local SSA offices until 90 days after the issuance of the Comptroller General's report. Requires that communicants with the SSA receive a written receipt which sets forth: (1) the name of the individual with whom they communicated; (2) the date of the communication; and (3) a description of the nature of such communication. Deems an individual who fails to apply for OASDI or SSI benefits by reason of misinformation provided to such individual by the SSA to have applied for such benefits when such misinformation was given or, if later, when such individual met the eligibility criteria for such benefits."
