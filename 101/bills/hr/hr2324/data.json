(Current law allows such action by the Commandant on a recommendation by a Coast Guard Enlisted Personnel Board.) Provides that, subject to any memorandum of understanding entered into between the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Transportation, when the Coast Guard transfers to and operates in its entirety as a service in the Navy, the appropriations, funding, functions, powers, and duties relating to the Coast Guard are also transferred to the Secretary of the Navy. Authorizes those Secretaries to provide, by memorandum of understanding, for the transfer of additional functions, powers, and duties.
