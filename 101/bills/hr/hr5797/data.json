Sets forth criminal penalties, and allows treble damages and costs, for inducing a contract pursuant to a deceptive practice. Authorizes any State attorney general to bring an action to secure relief for loss sustained by reason of any unfair consumer practice for which an action may be brought under specified provisions of this Act. Requires awarding treble damages and costs to the State. Requires notice by publication, with any final judgment being res judicata as to any person who fails to elect to exclude themselves from the State case. Authorizes the U.S. Attorney General, the appropriate U.S. attorney, the Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission, the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration, or the State Attorney General of an affected State, on a finding that a person is or is about to be engaged in a deceptive practice, to issue subpoenas and bring an action to enjoin the practice and obtain sanctions."
