Extends crop quality reduction disaster assistance through the 1989 crop year. Reduces disaster assistance payments in relation to Federal crop insurance payments. Requires producers to obtain Federal crop insurance for 1990 in order to be eligible for disaster payments and other specified assistance for 1989 crop losses. Sets forth exempted circumstances. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to announce within a specified time the conditions for establishing a 1989 farm yield for forage-use crops. Limits assistance under this Act at $100,000 per person. Authorizes the Secretary to determine a de minimis yield for each crop eligible for reduced yield disaster payments under this Act. Title II: Forest Crops - Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to tree farmers who lost seedlings in 1989 as a result of drought conditions. Limits assistance to any one person to $25,000. Title III: Administrative Provisions - Makes a person with qualifying annual gross revenues (as defined by this Act) in excess of $2,000,000 ineligible for assistance under this Act."
