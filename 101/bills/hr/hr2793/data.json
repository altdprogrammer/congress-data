Requires the Secretary to send the Congress annual plan descriptions and modifications. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Energy a program consistent with the plan. Lists research areas and priority criteria. Directs the Secretary to conduct demonstrations to evaluate technical and nontechnical parameters to determine commercial applicability of hydrogen technology and to prepare a comprehensive large-scale hydrogen demonstration plan. Directs the Secretary, with the advice and help of industry, academic, and governmental interests, to implement a program in the interest of accelerating broader application of hydrogen technologies and of increasing the participation of private sector interests in near commercial applications. Lists the Secretary's duties in connection with the program. Establishes a Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel as part of the Energy Research Advisory Board. Requires the Panel to submit an annual report. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Hydrogen-Fueled Aircraft Research and Development - Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive five-year program management plan for a research and development program for a domestic hydrogen-fueled aircraft capability within the shortest time practicable. Mandates that such plan include activities of the National Aero-Space Plane Program. Requires the Administrator to: (1) transmit to the Congress an annual plan description, including any necessary plan modifications; (2) establish such a program within NASA and incorporate within it the goals and activities of the National Aero-Space Plane Program; and (3) prepare and transmit to the Congress a comprehensive flight demonstration plan whose implementation will confirm the technical feasibility, economic viability, and safety of liquid hydrogen as a fuel for commercial transport aircraft. Prescribes required subjects of the research and development program. Establishes a Hydrogen-Fueled Aircraft Advisory Committee to advise the Administrator. Requires the Committee to report annually to the Administrator. Authorizes appropriations."
