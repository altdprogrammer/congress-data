Defines \"longshore work\" to include activities relating or incident to cargo loading or unloading, including the operation of cargo-related equipment and the securing of a vessel in the United States or its coastal waters. Stipulates that for purposes of reciprocal foreign states such term includes activities with respect to vessels in such states. Defines \"reciprocal foreign state\" to mean a state which permits U.S. nationals who are crewmen on U.S. ships to perform longshore work and where such work has taken place within the preceding six months. States that any person or entity who brings a person into the United States to perform longshore work shall be considered such person's employer as of the date such work begins. Requires such an employer to designate in writing a person or entity at a nearby U.S. port to maintain the required employment verification paperwork. States that classification as an alien crewman shall not by itself authorize longshore work. Provides for alternative employment verification documentation for longshore work by establishing: (1) that the alien is a national of a reciprocal foreign state; and (2) such work will be performed in connection with a reciprocal state's vessel."
