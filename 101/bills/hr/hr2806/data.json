Authorizes the Attorney General, in making such determination, to rely upon a written opinion of the Attorney General of the pertinent State that such process is not being utilized to circumvent State law. Specifies that the Attorney General's decision is not subject to review by any court. Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize the Attorney General to warrant clear title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee of forfeited property. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to authorize the Attorney General to carry out seizure and forfeiture of moneys in the manner provided with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of conveyances by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Tariff Act of 1930."
