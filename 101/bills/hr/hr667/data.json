Requires requests for procurement of advisory and assistance services to be included in presidential budget submissions. Requires the head of each agency to provide the Federal Procurement Data System timely, complete, and accurate information on: (1) contracts awarded primarily for the procurement of consulting services; and (2) procurements of consulting services under contracts awarded not primarily for the procurement of consulting services. Prohibits the award of a services contract to a consultant who does not meet registration requirements.
