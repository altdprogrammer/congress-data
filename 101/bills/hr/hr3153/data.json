    "text": "Pesticide Regulatory Reform Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to make technical amendments to provisions concerning the authority of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to cancel or suspend the registration of a pesticide. Directs the Administrator, prior to issuing a cancellation or suspension order, to notify the Secretary of Agriculture and, if the proposed order is based upon potential adverse effects to human health, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Permits the Administrator to deny registration applications or change the classification of a pesticide from general to restricted use. Sets forth review procedures for proposed cancellation orders, denials of registration applications, or proposed changes in classification. Sets forth judicial review procedures with respect to such orders and suspension or emergency suspension orders. Authorizes any person to petition the Administrator to suspend or cancel a registration, deny a registration application, or change the classification of a pesticide. Requires the Administrator to take such actions if they serve the purposes of this Act. Sets forth judicial remedies with respect to denied petitions. Authorizes the Administrator to summarily deny registration or exemption applications with respect to pesticides which have been subject to final orders cancelling or denying registration or changing classification unless the applicant has presented substantial new evidence which may affect the order. Sets forth judicial review and reconsideration procedures. Permits the Administrator, whenever a pesticide registration is cancelled or suspended, to allow the continued sale or use of existing stocks of such pesticide, as appropriate. Revises provisions concerning immediate suspensions of pesticide registrations. Authorizes the termination of a suspension at any time. Requires a termination upon completion of a cancellation proceeding. Authorizes the Administrator, if it is determined that the use of a pesticide may result in an imminent hazard, to issue an immediate emergency suspension order prior to notifying a registrant or consulting Federal agencies. Requires registrations of pesticides containing an active ingredient which were registered before November 1, 1984, to initially expire: (1) 19 years after the first registration of such pesticides; or (2) nine years after a date determined by the Administrator that products containing such ingredient are eligible for reregistration, whichever is later. Provides for the subsequent expiration of such registrations every nine years after the most recent expiration. Sets forth an expiration date of 15 years after the initial registration for pesticides registered after October 31, 1984. Provides for the same subsequent expiration date required for pesticides registered before November 1, 1984. Requires initial registrations of pesticides containing more than one active ingredient to expire at such time as the Administrator determines, provided that such date is no sooner than the earliest of the dates registrations of products containing each of the combined active ingredients as a single ingredient would have expired. Provides for the same subsequent expiration date applicable to pesticides containing one active ingredient. Deems pesticides with expired registrations to have been cancelled. Authorizes the sale and distribution of existing stocks of pesticides with expired registrations for one year following the expiration date, as appropriate. Prohibits registrants from selling and distributing more products than the average amount sold and distributed annually during the three years prior to the expiration date. Authorizes the Administrator to impose further limitations concerning the sale, distribution, or use of such products if such products may cause adverse environmental effects. Sets forth procedures with respect to registration renewals. Sets forth notification procedures with respect to expired registrations. Repeals a provision concerning public hearings and scientific review. Removes certain hearing requirements. Authorizes States to apply for continuing registration of a suspended pesticide use if severe economic dislocation will result from such suspension. Requires the Administrator to ensure that the use of such pesticides does not pose an excessive risk. Provides that continuing registrations shall expire: (1) one year after the granting of the registration; (2) upon completion of a cancellation proceeding; or (3) upon cancellation of the registration, whichever comes first. Prohibits the granting of more than three continuing registrations for a pesticide. Directs the Administrator to identify pests which must be brought under control and the available control measures. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to the Administrator on: (1) such pests and measures and areas of concern where the number of registered pesticides and other control alternatives is small enough to pose a risk to continued effective control or where pest resistance to current control measures has been detected; and (2) research and extension efforts underway to develop pest control methods for areas where effective control is threatened. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary to develop integrated pest management approaches to pest control and common methods for the computation of benefits accruing from the use of pesticides."
