Authorizes individuals whose adjusted income tax liability is $2 or more to designate that $2 be paid over to the Trust Fund. Authorizes expenditures from the Trust Fund to candidates who certify to the Federal Election Commission that: (1) they have received contributions totaling not less than $50,000, of which not more than $1,000 may be from their personal funds; and (2) they will not furnish from their personal funds more than $20,000 with respect to the election. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to authorize candidates for the House of Representatives to accept amounts from the Trust Fund. Prohibits candidates from making expenditures with respect to such general election totaling more than $400,000, with an exception. Provides a civil penalty for a violation of such limitation. Prohibits general election candidates for the House of Representatives from making loans totaling more than $50,000 to any campaign committee of such candidate with respect to the election."
