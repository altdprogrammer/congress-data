    "date": "1989-05-23", 
    "text": "American Family Act of 1989 - Title I: Programs Focusing on Education - Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary for purposes of this title) to make five-year grants to not more than ten State educational agencies for school-based management projects in one or more local educational agencies (LEAs) in those States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to authorize the Secretary to make grants to LEAs for parental choice open enrollment programs in public schools. Requires an independent evaluation of such programs to be reported to the Congress by October 1, 1992. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990. Amends ESEA to direct the Secretary to make grants to eligible LEAs for character education programs. Requires LEAs, as a condition of eligibility for such grants, to certify that the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag is part of the daily program of each of their elementary and secondary schools. Directs the Secretary to disseminate information on successful character education programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990. Directs the Secretary to make bootstrap school program competitive grants to eligible LEAs which serve qualified areas to enhance the quality of primary and secondary education. Requires that special consideration be given to applications that describe programs which will serve poverty areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990. Directs the Secretary to make three-year grants to not more than five States to provide bonus pay to special education teachers as an incentive to keep them in that field. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Title II: Family Support and Stability - Requires congressional committees to include family impact statements in their reports of public bills or joint resolutions. Makes it not in order for either House of the Congress to consider a public bill or joint resolution if the committee report does not contain such a statement. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to direct the Congressional Budget Office to assist such committees, at their request, to prepare such statements. Requires each executive agency to include a family impact statement in every recommendation or report on a proposal for legislation or other major Federal action significantly affecting families in the United States. Requires each agency to use approaches and develop procedures to give appropriate consideration to potential effects of its proposed actions, decisions, and activities on such families. Requires agency review of existing authorities, rules, and policies and procedures, and a report to the President and the Congress on such review, with recommendations, within one year after enactment of this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a refundable child tax credit and a refundable child and dependent care tax credit. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, to direct public housing agencies to set maximum monthly rents for their tenants. Amends the Federal criminal code to make it a Federal criminal offense to leave or remain outside a State for the purpose of avoiding payment of arrearages in child support. Title III: Programs Focusing on Children - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to eligible applicant organizations to improve health, family, and preschool services for families with children under age 13. Sets forth eligibility requirements for such organizations, including location in or near a high risk area for infant mortality, teenage pregnancy, or high school dropouts. Includes among such services prenatal and postnatal care, nutritional lunches, on-site nurse practitioners, family drop-in centers, Head Start program associated services, parenting education, drug abuse prevention, family- or center-based child care, and after-school child care. Gives primary consideration to the service delivery location. Limits such grants to a specified portion of start-up costs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990. Directs the Secretary of Education to allot funds to State education agencies, according to a formula based on State population, for demonstration grants for LEA early childhood education programs.
