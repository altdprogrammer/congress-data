Requires the Director, the head of the Council of the Chehalis Tribe, the head of the Council of the Quinault Indian Nation, and each head of a State department participating to enter into a memorandum of understanding setting forth the responsibilities of each entity. Requires that the study take advantage of and build on ongoing watershed planning and research efforts to identify fishery resource problems in the Basin. Requires cost-sharing of at least one-sixth by non-Federal and nontribal participants before Washington may participate in the study. Authorizes appropriations, requiring that, of any amounts appropriated, one-fifth be made available to the Chehalis Tribe and the Quinault Indian Nation to carry out their responsibilities under the memorandum of understanding."
