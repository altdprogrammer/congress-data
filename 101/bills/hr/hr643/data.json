    "text": "Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 to direct the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to implement a program for expediting determinations of the validity of all unpatented oil shale claims, including those for which patent applications have not been filed. Requires the Secretary to cancel invalid claims. Sets deadlines within which the Secretary must publish in the Federal Register proposed and final regulations containing criteria for determining the validity of all unpatented oil shale claims. Requires the Secretary to determine the validity of such claims within two years after promulgation of the final regulations. Prohibits the issuance of any patents for oil shale claims for which an application was filed after January 24, 1989, and which do not fully comply with specified statutory requirements. Sets forth a schedule within which oil shale claim holders who have been denied a patent must elect to: (1) apply for an oil shale lease; (2) comply with diligent development requirements regarding oil shale production; or (3) make specified payments to the Secretary in lieu of diligent development. Requires the Secretary to: (1) cancel the claim of any owner who does not make such an election; and (2) annually review the claim holders' compliance with the expenditure requirements. Declares that the Multiple Minerals Development Act of 1954 and the Surface Resources Act of 1955 apply to unpatented oil shale claims. Mandates that lease or claim holders under this Act reclaim the affected site and post a bond before disturbance of the site to guarantee its reclamation. Authorizes the Secretary to issue a patent for oil shale claims for which a patent application was filed before January 24, 1989, but with respect to which all requirements were not fully met, if the Secretary determines such claims are valid and the statutory requirements are subsequently met. Limits such patents to oil shale and associated minerals. Conditions such patent upon payment to the Secretary of $2,000 per acre and expressly reserves the land surface to the United States. Declares the Multiple Minerals Development Act of 1954 and the Surface Resources Act applicable to such patents. Exempts such patent holders from the election requirements of this Act."
