    "text": "Foreign Service Internship Act of 1989 - Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to mandate intensive recruitment efforts to ensure that the Foreign Service reflects the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States. Directs the Secretary of State to establish a Foreign Service Internship Program to introduce qualified individuals who reflect such diversity to the practice of diplomacy. Provides that such Program shall consist of three successive summer internships over a maximum of four years and shall place special emphasis on preparation for the Foreign Service examination. Limits the Program to 15 interns. Makes eligible for internships students enrolled full-time in institutions of higher learning from groups which are underrepresented in the Foreign Service in terms of cultural and ethnic diversity. Sets forth Program admission requirements, including the successful completion of one year of study at such an institution and the maintenance of an exemplary academic record in succeeding years. Directs the Secretary to select students on the basis of demonstrated achievement and whose academic records reflect the requisite standards of performance for the Foreign Service. Sets forth the primary focus of the successive internships, including: (1) the study of international relations and the functions and nature of the Foreign Service system; (2) the assignment to a specific bureau of the Department of State; and (3) the assignment to a U.S. mission abroad. Makes the Secretary responsible for the design and operation of the Program. Requires each intern to be assigned a career Foreign Service officer as a mentor. Directs the Secretary to give preference to officers who volunteer for such assignment. Authorizes the Secretary to administer the Foreign Service examination in annual increments. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the Program and to include information regarding intern completion rates, examination passage rates, and the assignment and advancement of former interns through the Foreign Service system. Authorizes appropriations."
