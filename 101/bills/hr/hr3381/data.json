    "text": "Malheur Refuge Expansion Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to acquire for incorporation into the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge the lands, waters, and interests therein depicted on the map dated October 1988 on file with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire other lands and waters to facilitate the acquisition of lands and waters depicted on such map that would otherwise leave an owner of those lands and waters with an uneconomic remnant. Requires the Secretary to acquire such lands and waters by acquisition of fee title or a perpetual or 50-year conservation easement, at the discretion of the owner. Permits the Secretary to acquire lands under this Act even if those lands are subject to any adverse claim of the State of Oregon based upon a specified assertion. Provides for the compensation for lands and waters acquired under this Act. Waives the applicability to acquisitions under this Act of specified provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act relating to the requirement that Federal agencies produce environmental impact statements in certain circumstances. Requires the Secretary to administer lands and waters acquired under this Act in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Authorizes appropriations."
