Requires the President, within one year after enactment of this Act, to notify the Congress whether such agreement has been reached. Requires the Congress to consider legislation imposing import duties on Japanese products to generate revenues equal to such fee if: (1) no such agreement has been reached; or (2) the agreement reached does not satisfy requirements of this Act."
