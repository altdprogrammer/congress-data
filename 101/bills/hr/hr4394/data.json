    "text": "Value-Added Agricultural Trade Act of 1990 - Declares that U.S. agricultural export policy shall provide for increased emphasis on sales abroad of U.S. processed, value-added agricultural products due to benefits from such sales to U.S. producers, processors, agricultural-industrial exporters, and the national workforce. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to take specified action aimed at increasing exports of U.S. processed, value-added agricultural products. Requires the President, in determining the budgets of the Department of Agriculture, to give special consideration to the Secretary's export enhancement funding. Urges U.S. representatives at General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations to press for elimination or reduction of agricultural export subsidies, tariff and nontariff barriers, unfair practices, and other impediments to sales abroad of U.S. processed, value-added agricultural products. Requires the implementation of available agricultural export assistance programs to offset the adverse effects of such practices on U.S. agricultural products. Amends the Agricultural Trade and Development Assistance Act of 1954 to require the President to ensure that at least 75 percent of the agricultural commodities distributed for famine relief be in the form of processed or fortified products or bagged commodities. Authorizes appropriations."
