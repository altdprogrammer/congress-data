    "text": "Renewable Energy Technology Transfer Act of 1990 - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Energy to fund up to 20 innovative State conservation and technology transfer programs annually. Authorizes appropriations to enable the Department of Energy national laboratories to provide up-to-date information and publications on renewable energy efficiency to industry, Government, and the general public. Authorizes appropriations for the Secretary to establish four pilot programs to demonstrate new or successful model technology transfer and design assistance programs. Directs the Secretary to develop a Strategic Technology Transfer Implementation Plan for the national and international transfer of renewable energy and energy efficiency technology information. Authorizes appropriations for the establishment of Committee on Renewable Energy Commerce and Trade (CORRECT) industry outreach offices in the Pacific Rim and the Caribbean Basin, to provide renewable energy and energy efficiency technology information to governments, industry, and others outside the United States. Authorizes appropriations for the establishment of an advanced research and development information computer network to provide local governments, technology and business entities, and consumers with information on new advances in renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development that have unique export potential such as: (1) solar detoxification; (2) solar desalinization; (3) hydrogen electrolysis; (4) water pumping; and (5) water purification. Authorizes appropriations for the establishment of a United States technology training program for the training of individuals associated with foreign governments, research organizations, private voluntary organizations, and industry."
