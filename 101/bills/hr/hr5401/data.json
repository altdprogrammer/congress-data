    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-12", 
    "text": "Title I: Bank Fraud and Embezzlement Penalties - Comprehensive Thrift and Bank Fraud Prosecution and Taxpayer Recovery Act of 1990 - Amends Federal criminal law to establish criminal penalties (including imprisonment) for the concealment of assets from an appropriate Federal banking agency or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) (acting as conservator or receiver). Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Insurance Act to prohibit certain felons convicted of dishonesty or breach of trust from controlling or participating in the affairs of a depository institution. Amends Federal criminal law to establish criminal penalties (including imprisonment) for obstructing any examination of a financial institution. Increases to 30 years (currently 20 years) the maximum prison term for bank fraud and embezzlement. Establishes a ten-year statute of limitations for the prosecution of racketeering offenses involving financial institutions. Extends money laundering prohibitions to include funds from specified bank crimes. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines for increased penalties for certain bank crime convictions in which the defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense. Provides for restoration of forfeited property and for restitution to bank crime victims. Sets forth maximum criminal fines and minimum imprisonment terms (which may be up to life imprisonment) for certain continuing financial crime enterprises (i.e., certain violations committed by at least four persons acting in concert). Authorizes U.S. magistrates to accept guilty pleas for certain felonies affecting an insured depository institution. Authorizes the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the chairman of the RTC to institute civil remedies proceedings for certain criminal violations affecting insured depository institutions. Title II: Protecting Assets from Wrongful Disposition - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the National Credit Union Act and the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to set forth circumstances under which injunctive relief (including prejudgment attachment) may be granted in an action brought by the FDIC, the RTC, or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) acting as conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution. Authorizes the Attorney General to obtain a court order enjoining or restraining the alienation or disposition of property obtained as a result of a banking law violation. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to set forth asset attachment procedures. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide that the liability arising from a breach of trust by an institution-related party towards the financial institution constitutes a debt that is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Makes it a prerequisite of a bankruptcy reorganization plan that the debtor will: (1) maintain any commitment to a Federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution; and (2) continue to be obligated for any debt to such agency for failure to fulfill such commitment. Amends Federal bankruptcy law to except from general discharges in bankruptcy: (1) any commitment entered into by the debtor and specified Federal banking regulatory agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution; (2) court-ordered restitution in any criminal proceeding arising from an act that caused a loss to a federally insured financial institution; and (3) certain obligations and liabilities (including those ordered by a court, issued by a Federal regulatory agency, or contained in a settlement agreement) arising from malfeasance while acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to a financial institution. States that a Federal financial institution regulatory agency that is a successor and creditor to a depository institution or insured credit union need not demonstrate reasonable reliance upon a written statement in order to establish an exception to a discharge in bankruptcy. Prohibits an individual debtor from discharging in bankruptcy debts and title to property that is owed to a Federal financial institutions regulatory agency acting as conservator or receiver. Provides that the trustee shall be deemed to have assumed a debtor's commitment to a Federal depository institution regulatory agency to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution (thus precluding the trustee from rejecting such commitment as an executory contract which can be avoided as a discharge in bankruptcy). Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to empower the FDIC and the NCUA (acting as conservators) to avoid fraudulent conveyances by a debtor institution-affiliated party. Prohibits certain insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, or credit unions from making golden parachute payments, covered benefit payments, or certain payments in anticipation of insolvency to an institution-affiliated party without prior written Federal agency approval. Cites conditions under which insured depository institutions and credit unions may make golden parachute payments and covered benefits payments with FDIC or NCUA approval. Amends the Federal criminal code to revise the civil and criminal forfeiture guidelines for: (1) property affecting a financial institution; and (2) fraudulent offenses involving the sale of assets held by Federal banking regulatory agencies. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to prohibit certain convicted felony debtors whose default to an insured financial institution in receivership will cause substantial loss from acquiring any asset of the institution (except with respect to repayment). Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to direct the Resolution Trust Corporation to prescribe regulations prohibiting itself from selling the assets of a failed institution to persons who have caused specified damage to such institution or have been prohibited from participating in its affairs pursuant to a Federal enforcement action. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide that actions brought by the FDIC shall have priority over all other actions except Federal actions unless the FDIC is notified in writing of the commencement of another suit or claim. Sets forth expedited procedures for certain claims. Title III: Improved Procedures for Handling Banking-Related Cases - Amends Federal criminal law to authorize wire taps for bank fraud and related offenses. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to set forth reciprocal assistance guidelines for foreign investigations by Federal banking agencies and investigations on behalf of foreign banking authorities. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and the Internal Revenue Code to establish a ten-year statute of limitations for commencing a civil action for Federal bank law violations. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the National Credit Union Act to grant the FDIC, the RTC, and the NCUA subpoena authority. Title IV: Structural Reforms to Improve the Federal Response to Crimes Affecting Financial Institutions - Establishes within the Office of the Deputy Attorney General in the Department of Justice a Financial Institutions Fraud Unit, headed by a Special Counsel who shall report directly to the Deputy Attorney General. Terminates such Office five years after enactment of this Act. Empowers the Special Counsel to investigate and prosecute criminal activity involving the financial services industry. Directs the Attorney General to establish: (1) financial institutions fraud task forces; and (2) a senior interagency group to assist in identifying the most significant financial institution fraud cases, to allocate investigative and prosecutorial resources, and to expedite interagency coordination and prosecution of financial institutions fraud. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to direct the RTC to maintain a Fraud and Enforcement Review Division to assist and advise it with respect to claims and enforcement actions against institution-affiliated parties of insured depository institutions under its jurisdiction. Requires such Division to report semiannually to certain congressional committees.
