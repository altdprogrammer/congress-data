Requires that sums recovered by Federal and State natural resource trustees for damages to natural resources resulting from spills of oil or hazardous substances be retained by the trustee for use only to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of such natural resources. Directs the President to promulgate regulations governing the assessment of damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or hazardous substances."
