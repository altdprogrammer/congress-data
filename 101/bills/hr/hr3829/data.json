    "text": "Conservation Reserve Program Enhancement Act of 1989 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the conservation reserve program (CRP) through the 1995 crop year. Shortens contract length to five years (reduced from ten) for conservation priority areas. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire 50-year easements for conservation, water quality, recreational, and wildlife purposes on property enrolled in the conservation reserve upon termination of contracts. Allows designation of watershed areas of special environmental sensitivity as conservation priority areas. Authorizes program participation incentives to farmers, including one-time bonuses, higher rental premiums, narrower filter strips, allowing CRP acreage to count toward set-aside land, and paying up to 90 percent of conservation costs. Encourages tree planting."
