    "text": "Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish a program for the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a specified rate for FY 1990 and thereafter until the quantity of crude oil in storage in the Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels; and (2) provide for storage in the Reserve of petroleum product equal to a percentage which the Secretary determines periodically to be sufficient to produce such fill rate if the percentage is applied uniformly to all importers. Prescribes implementation procedures. Directs the Secretary to assess and collect charges from each person who has petroleum product stored in the Reserve. Increases from 75,000 barrels to 100,000 barrels the average daily fill rate which must be attained for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve before crude oil in the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve may be sold to an entity other than the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Extends authorities relating to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until September 30, 1995."
