    "text": "East-West Trade and Human Rights Enhancement Act of 1989 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to declare that a nonmarket economy country: (1) that is not eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) may not thereafter be granted such treatment unless the President determines that it is satisfactorily implementing internationally recognized worker rights; or (2) that is eligible for such treatment shall continue to be eligible subject to its recognition of fundamental human rights. States that the eligibility of such a country, if in effect within three years after enactment of this Act, shall terminate unless the President determines that it is recognizing such worker rights. Terminates three years after enactment of this Act the eligibility of nonmarket economy countries currently exempted from the human rights requirements of such Act unless the President determines that they are satisfactorily implementing worker rights. Requires the President, after making an affirmative determination that a nonmarket economy country is implementing such worker rights, to monitor the condition of such rights in that country. Authorizes the President to grant special tariff treatment for goods produced by one or more qualified cooperative enterprises in any nonmarket economy country that is not eligible for commercial benefits with the United States, if the President considers that such treatment will encourage that country to implement changes necessary to enable it to become eligible. Prohibits the President from granting such tariff treatment unless he submits to the Congress a report containing certain specifications. Provides for the suspension or withdrawal of such special treatment by the President. Authorizes the President to enter into bilateral commercial agreements that provide most-favored-nation treatment to countries previously denied such treatment provided that such country is taking steps to extend internationally recognized worker rights to its own workers. Establishes the United States-Nonmarket Economy Cooperative Enterprise Foundation to increase the trade and commercial linkages between the United States and cooperative enterprises in nonmarket economy countries. Establishes in the Treasury the Enterprise Foundation Trust Fund. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer specified funds from the general fund into the Trust Fund. Authorizes appropriations."
