    "text": "Clean Air Act Research Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a research and development program for measuring, monitoring, and analyzing air pollutants, including precursors of acid deposition. Requires the Administrator, as part of such program, to: (1) carry out research at the Liquefied Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility for the development of a chemical field testing program and atmospheric dispersion models; and (2) evaluate hazard mitigation and emergency response technology for accidental releases of toxic chemicals. Directs the Administrator to conduct a research program on the effects of air pollutants on human health, including the effects of acid deposition and acid aerosols. Requires such programs to include: (1) the creation of an Interagency Task Force to coordinate the program; and (2) evaluations and environmental health assessments for each of the hazardous air pollutants listed in H.R. 3030. Directs the Administrator to conduct a research program to improve understanding of the causes, effects, and trends of ecosystem damages from air pollutants, including damages from acid deposition. Requires the Administrator to conduct a basic engineering research, technology, and development program for air pollution and acid deposition prevention. Provides that such program shall develop improved strategies and technologies for: (1) reducing multiple air pollutants from fossil fuel power plants, stationary sources, and other combustion facilities; (2) preventing air emissions from mobile and nonpoint pollution sources; (3) preventing, detecting, and correcting sudden and accidental releases of hazardous air pollutants; and (4) tire disposal methods that avoid adverse air quality impacts. Directs the Administrator to implement and submit to the Congress a plan to carry out such research in conjunction with other Federal global change and acid deposition research efforts. Requires the President to develop and submit to the Congress: (1) a plan designating activities and assigning responsibilities for Federal research on acid deposition; and (2) an assessment framework for reporting technical information about acid deposition in a manner useful to policymakers and the public. Directs the President to report to the Congress on the reduction in deposition that must be achieved to prevent adverse ecological effects. Requires the Administrator to conduct a research program to identify and predict air emissions and other environmental effects related to the production, distribution, storage, and use of clean alternative fuels to determine the risks to health and the environment relative to those from the use of gasoline and diesel. Directs the Administrator to study international air pollution control technologies of selected industrialized countries to determine whether such countries have technologies that may have beneficial applications to U.S. air pollution control efforts."
