Amends Federal law to: (1) include as a benefit to certain veterans the provision of hearing dogs trained to assist deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals; (2) permit hearing dogs trained to assist a deaf or hard-of-hearing individual to be admitted to public buildings and other properties owned by the United States; and (3) permit certain common carriers to continue to establish a special rate for transportation of a hearing-impaired individual when accompanied by a dog trained to assist the individual. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a commission regarding measures that should be taken to provide rights regarding the use of guide dogs by deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals."
