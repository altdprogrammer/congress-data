    "text": "Business/Education Clearinghouse Act of 1990 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to require State job training coordinating councils to assist in the formation of business/education compacts under which schools reduce dropout rates and improve student attendance, grades, and test scores in return for the commitment of local businesses to give employment priority to graduates attaining such goals. Directs the councils to: (1) design comprehensive statewide information networks to encourage businesses, State and local government agencies, and community organizations to establish such compacts; (2) provide informational assistance and materials to groups interested in establishing such compacts; and (3) designate an individual on the council, appointed by the Governor, to provide information and direction to those establishing such compacts. Allows the use of funds available for State education agency coordination and grants to cover the costs of compliance with this Act."
