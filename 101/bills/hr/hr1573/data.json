    "text": "Child Investment and Security Act of 1989 - Title I: Prenatal Care - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to phase-in mandatory State coverage of pregnant women and infants whose family income is below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Includes prenatal and postpartum home visitation services within such coverage. Deducts child and medical care costs from the income eligibility test. Requires the continuation of such coverage for women through the month in which the 60-day post-partum period expires, and for infants throughout their first year of life. Requires that States make ambulatory prenatal care available to a pregnant woman during a presumptive eligibility period which ends when she is determined to be ineligible for Medicaid benefits or 14 days after she is determined to be eligible, but fails to apply. Requires that States submit information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, by April 1 of each year, pertaining to the supply of and demand for obstetrical and pediatric services and proposed Medicaid payment rates for such services so that the Secretary may determine whether such rates are sufficient to ensure that obstetrical and pediatric services will be at least as available to Medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population. Requires States to immediately revise rates determined to be insufficient. Amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) of the Act to increase authorized appropriations for the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Program. Sets aside such additional appropriations for the expansion of prenatal care services for pregnant women and infants in target populations which include pregnant women and infants who are economically disadvantaged and who reside within areas or among populations suffering disproportionately high levels of infant mortality and inadequate maternity and infant care. Amends the Public Health Service Act to increase and permanently extend authorized appropriations for grants to community and migrant health centers for services promoting the reduction of infant mortality and the management of health services for pregnant women and infants. Title II: Preventive Child Health - Amends the Medicaid program to phase-in mandatory coverage of children under age eight whose family income is below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Requires States to receive and process the Medicaid applications of such children at locations which include locations other than those used for applications under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1990 through 1993 for supplemental grants to public entities for the inclusion of immunization training and outreach services within their immunization programs. Title III: Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the Secretary to allocate specified funds among States from FY 1990 through 1993 under the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC). Title IV: Early Childhood Education - Amends the Head Start Act to increase and extend, through FY 1993, authorized appropriations for Head Start programs. Title V: Application Process for Certain Forms of Federal Assistance with Respect to Child Health - Directs the Secretary to develop a plan, to be implemented within nine months of this Act's enactment, for the use of a single, standardized application form for simultaneously requesting assistance for children under age six under the Social Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, and the Head Start Act."
