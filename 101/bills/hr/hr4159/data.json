Authorizes the Commission to secure from the Postal Service the information necessary to enable it to carry out its functions under provisions relating to permanent rates and classes of mail and rate and service complaints. Requires the Postal Service to furnish such information to the Commission upon request. Allows the Commission to extend the ten-month period within which it is required to transmit its recommended decision to the Governors by one day for each day the Postal Service unreasonably delays consideration of its request to change postal rates or fees by failing to respond to a request for information."
