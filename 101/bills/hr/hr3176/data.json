    "text": "Childless Veterans Adoption Assistance Act of 1989 - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reimburse an eligible veteran for qualifying adoption expenses. Prohibits the Secretary from providing such reimbursement for qualifying adoption expenses: (1) that are paid to such veteran under any other adoption benefits program administered by the Federal, State, or local government; or (2) in an amount greater than $2,000 per child or $4,000 per family. Defines \"eligible veteran\" as a married veteran with a service-connected disability which prevents or impairs the ability of the veteran and his or her spouse to conceive a child. Defines \"qualifying adoption expenses\" as reasonable and necessary expenses that are directly related to the legal adoption of a child under 18 years of age. Prohibits qualifying adoption expenses from including expenses incurred for any travel performed outside the United States, except under limited circumstances. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on findings and recommendations concerning such adoption expenses reimbursement program."
