    "as": "Senate receded and concurred with amendment",

    "text": "Drug Abuse Treatment Technical Corrections Act of 1989 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise the formula for allotments to States and territories for alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services block grants. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, notwithstanding specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act, with respect to FY 1989, to waive a requirement that certain amounts paid to a State for such block grants, obligated by the State, and remaining unexpended at the end of the fiscal year remain available during the succeeding fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement in specified provisions regarding minimum expenditures by States for alcohol and drug abuse activities if the Secretary determines that the incidence of intravenous drug abuse in the State does not require the level of funding required in such provisions. Amends provisions requiring a set-aside of a portion of the block grant funds for programs and services for women to require that the focus be on alcohol and drug abuse. Declares that provisions requiring States to use a portion of the block grants for group homes for recovering substance abusers do not apply to any U.S. territory other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Prohibits an allotment of block grant funds being made to a State unless its legislature holds public hearings on the proposed use and distribution of funds. (Current law requires such hearings after the first fiscal year in which a State receives an allotment under provisions relating to set-aside for an Indian tribe or tribal organization.) Changes the composition of State mental health services planning councils. Requires the development of a model plan for a community-based system for seriously mentally ill individuals. (Current law requires development of such a plan for a system for chronically mentally ill individuals.) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration to establish program advisory committees and to pay members of the committees. Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act establishing a grant program for demonstration projects relating to, among other matters, mental health services to focus on seriously mentally ill individuals rather than chronically ill individuals. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the establishment of the National Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Advisory Board by April 1, 1989. Allows exclusion, in computing the maximum number of commissioned officers of the Public Health Service authorized by law to hold a grade corresponding to brigadier or major general, for officers assigned to duty with the Department of Defense. (Current law allows exclusion for such officers only if assigned to duty with the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.) Amends specified provisions of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney Act) and the Public Health Service Act to read as if the amendments made by title VI (Revision and Extension of Programs of Health Care for the Homeless) of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 had not been enacted. Amends the McKinney Act so as to authorize appropriations for a National Mental Health Education Program rather than for community mental health services demonstration projects. Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow recipients of grants for health service delivery to homeless individuals to provide dental, vision, and podiatry services as well as mental health and other services. Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to grants and contracts for community-based evaluations of experimental therapies for infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to require that programs carried out with such assistance be designed to encourage schools of osteopathic medicine, as well as private industry and schools of medicine, to participate in and support the evaluations. Amends provisions relating to default on loans under the Federal program of insured loans to graduate students in health professions schools to require the Secretary to make the payment or deny the claim not later than 60 days after the Secretary determines that the lender or holder has made reasonable efforts to secure and collect on a judgment against the borrower. (Current law requires the Secretary to take such action not later than 60 days after the eligible institution notifies the Secretary that judgment has been entered on an action for the default.)"
