    "text": "Aid for Trade Act of 1990 - Title I: Use of Foreign Assistance Funds - Allocates, on a percentage basis, bilateral economic assistance for FY 1992 through 1996 for the construction, design, or servicing of capital projects. Limits the use of such assistance to the procurement of U.S. goods and services. Sets specified percentage limits on cash transfers with respect to such economic assistance and Economic Support Funds for FY 1992 through 1996. Requires the Comptroller General to submit to the Congress a study of cash transfer assistance. Declares that nothing in this Act is intended to reduce the amount of bilateral economic assistance (including grants) for any fiscal year for least-developed beneficiary developing countries. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require the Administrator of each agency, in determining the geographic code for the purchase of goods and services, not to grant any waivers from Geographic Codes 000 (United States only) or 941 (United States and least-developed countries) except for specified reasons. Requires the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to report annually to the Congress on such waivers. Title II: Increase in Credit Authority - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to direct the Export-Import Bank to increase its direct loans for FY 1992 through 1996 by 15 percent per year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 and 1993 to the Tied Aid Credit Fund. Amends the Trade and Development Enhancement Act of 1983 to authorize appropriations for FY 1992 and 1993 to finance a tied aid credit activity. Title III: Eastern Europe Recovery Program - Establishes the Eastern European Loan Guarantee Program to be administered through the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide guarantees to U.S. lenders and exporters for projects which provide for the export of U.S.-made products and services to Eastern Europe. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to extend the authority of the Bank to make interest subsidy payments to lenders who provide loans in support of U.S. exports through October 1, 1993. Authorizes appropriations to the Bank for FY 1992 and 1993 with respect to such payments for use in Eastern Europe only. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the amount of direct investment loans that the Corporation must make each fiscal year. Earmarks a specified amount of such loans to promote the activities of U.S. small businesses in Eastern Europe. Title IV: General Provisions - Defines \"bilateral economic assistance.\""
