Makes three 50-minute courses the equivalent of three hours for purposes of course measurement. Requires that the number of credit hours represented by such unit courses be converted to equivalent clock hours and combined with actual weekly clock hours of training concurrently pursued to determine the total clock hours of enrollment. Provides for the determination of clock-hour equivalency of credit hours represented by a course."
