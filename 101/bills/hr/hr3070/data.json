Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to prohibit total budget outlays for a fiscal year from exceeding the maximum percentage of gross national product (GNP) for such fiscal year. Provides that the applicable maximum percentage of the GNP shall decrease incrementally from 21.5 percent for FY 1990 to 20 percent for FY 1993 and thereafter. Repeals the expiration date for such emergency powers."
