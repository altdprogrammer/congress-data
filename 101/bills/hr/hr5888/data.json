Directs the Secretary to make grants to States that have established State loan repayment programs to share the costs incurred by local communities and by the States in providing funds to full-time students in a program leading to a degree in medicine or osteopathy or licensure or certification as a nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Requires each student to agree to serve at least two years (but not less than the number of years in which the applicant was provided assistance). Requires that grant funds provided to States be used for 25 percent of the costs of the education. Requires students receiving assistance to serve in the rural community represented by the local community that provided assistance. Authorizes appropriations."
