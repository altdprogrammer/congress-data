    "text": "Augustus F. Hawkins Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1990 - Title I: Head Start - Subtitle A: Amendments to the Head Start Act - Head Start Expansion and Quality Improvement Act - Amends the Head Start Act to include non-English language background children among those special groups whose needs must be addressed through an administrative arrangement and appropriate funding. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994. Reserves specified amounts of Head Start funds for: (1) Indian and migrant programs; (2) training and technical assistance; (3) quality improvement activities, including Head Start staff compensation (if appropriations exceed a specified amount to protect current services); and (4) Parent-Child Centers. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to establish procedures to enable Head Start agencies to develop locally designed or specialized service delivery models to address local community needs. Requires the Secretary to allocate funds to maintain the level of prior year services (with consideration for inflation) before using any additional funds (due to any funding increase for the current fiscal year) to serve an increased number of children. Directs the Secretary to prepare, through the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and submit to specified congressional committees: (1) an interim comprehensive report by July 1, 1993; and (2) a final comprehensive report by January 1, 1994. Requires such reports to contain specified types of information on Head Start programs. Revises conditions on renewed funding of Head Start agencies which receive grants. Directs the Secretary to conduct a full review of each designated Head Start agency at least once every three years to determine compliance with program and fiscal requirements. Requires that such reviews: (1) to the maximum extent practicable, be carried out by HHS employees knowledgeable about Head Start; (2) be supervised at the agency site; (3) measure compliance with specified performance standards; and (4) identify types and conditions of facilities in which the programs are located. Declares that the results of such a review shall not be sufficient alone for determining continuation or discontinuation of funding. Revises provisions relating to the designation of Head Start agencies. Specifies additional criteria to be considered in designating Head Start agencies in unserved areas. Requires Head Start agencies to involve parents of participating children in educational services in order to aid their children to attain their full potential. Revises provisions for Head Start program coordination with other agencies and programs serving the same children and families to specifically include schools subsequently serving such children and the State agency for the welfare JOBS programs. Specifies that it is the required non-Federal contributions which are to be taken into account under the formula for administrative cost limitations. Prohibits the use of Head Start funds to assist, promote, or deter union organizing. Revises a date for purposes of calculating income to determine eligibility for Head Start participation. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing or enforcing any rule or guideline that would forbid any Head Start agency from carrying out a program in its community which provides more than one year of Head Start services to children from age three to the age of compulsory school attendance in that State. Revises Head Start notice and hearing requirements to: (1) extend to cases of reductions of assistance the protections which currently apply to cases of terminations of assistance; and (2) prohibit the Secretary from prescribing any procedure that would modify the operation of specified notice and hearing requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations. Requires the Secretary to provide training for personnel serving non-English background children in Head Start programs. Establishes requirements for Head Start staff qualifications. Directs the Secretary to ensure that, by the end of FY 1994, each Head Start classroom in a center-based program is assigned one teacher who has: (1) a child development associate (CDA) credential appropriate to the age-group served; (2) a State-awarded certificate for preschool teachers that meets or exceeds CDA credential requirements; (3) an associate, baccalaureate, or advanced degree in early childhood education; or (4) a degree in a field related to early childhood education with experience in teaching preschool children and a State-awarded certificate to teach in a preschool program. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to waive such requirements for 180 days for individuals who: (1) are first employed as Head Start teachers after September 30, 1994; (2) are enrolled in a CDA program; and (3) will receive the CDA credential within 180 days after beginning such teaching. Defines a Head Start classroom as a group of children supervised and taught by two paid staff members (a teacher and a teacher's aide or two teachers) and, where possible, a volunteer. Directs the Secretary to: (1) study and report on various approaches to providing early, continuous, and comprehensive intervention to low-income or at-risk children from birth to age three and to the families of such children; (2) study and report on Head Start family day care; and (3) submit biennial reports to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of children in Head Start programs (including disabled and non-English language background children). Encourages the Secretary to provide funds for community-based cooperative research efforts to enable Head Start directors to conduct program evaluations with the assistance of qualified researchers not directly involved in program administration or project operation. Directs the Secretary to conduct a longitudinal study of the effects that participation in Head Start programs have on the development of participants and their families and the manner in which such effects are achieved.
