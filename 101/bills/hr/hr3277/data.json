    "text": "Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Reform Act of 1989 - Title I: Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Fund and Liability - Amends the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Authorization Act to repeal the limits placed on liability for oil pollution damages caused by a holder of a pipeline right-of-way. Declares that certain liability provisions of the Act shall apply only to incidents occurring before the enactment of this Act. Title II: Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Trust Fund - Establishes the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Trust Fund (TAPS Trust Fund). Imposes a specified fee on oil transported through the trans-Alaska pipeline, and directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to deposit such fees into the TAPS Trust Fund for the safe and environmentally sound operation of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. Title III: Improvement of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System - Establishes the Presidential Task Force on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to: (1) conduct a comprehensive audit and review of the trans-Alaska pipeline system; (2) make recommendations to the President and the Congress; (3) function as a permanent forum for improved oversight and enforcement of safety and environmental laws related to the trans-Alaska pipeline system; and (4) report to the President and the Congress regarding the audit results. Requires an annual report to the President and the Congress. Establishes the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Terminal Advisory Council to: (1) assist trans-Alaska pipeline operators and government officials in developing policies, permits, and regulations relating to pipeline facilities that may effect public health and safety and the environment; and (2) serve as a forum for industrial users, owners, and operators of terminal facilities to work cooperatively with local residents. Conditions use and operation of pipeline and terminal facilities along the trans-Alaska right-of-way upon cooperation with the Advisory Council through frequent consultation, attendance at meetings, and by granting the Council access to all facilities and requested documents and information. Directs the Advisory Council to submit an annual status report to the Task Force, the Governor of Alaska, and the Congress. Title IV: Alaska Oil Spill Recovery Institute - Directs the Secretary to establish the Alaska Oil Spill Recovery Institute to: (1) research and implement oil spill cleanup and prevention technology in the arctic and subarctic marine environment; and (2) assess the long-term Exxon Valdez oil spill's effects upon the Alaskan environment and natural resources. Directs the Institute to establish a Scientific and Technical Committee to advise its Board of Directors. Directs the Institute to submit an annual status report to the Governor of Alaska and to the Congress. Title V: Penalties - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to increase the civil penalty for noncompliance with such Act to $20,000. Directs the Secretary to adjust such penalty on a triennial basis to reflect any increases in the Consumer Price Index. Directs the Secretary to assess a civil penalty for any oil discharges occurring at various transit stages related to the trans-Alaska pipeline. Imposes joint, several, and strict liability upon the owners of oil for the full amount of penalties assessed for an oil discharge (or any threat of one). Sets a minimum civil penalty amount of $1,000 per barrel of oil discharged. Title VI: Provisions Applicable to Alaska Natives - Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to declare that solely for the purposes of bringing oil pollution liability claims, all Federal interest in lands validly selected but not yet conveyed to Alaska Native Corporations are deemed to have vested in the respective corporations as of March 23, 1989. Amends Federal law to direct the Secretary to report to the Congress the results of a study of the issues of recovery of damages, contingency plans, and coordinated actions in the event of an oil spill in the Arctic Ocean. Title VII: State Laws and Programs - Declares that this Act does not preempt or affect State laws, programs, and authorities regarding oil pollution liabilities. Directs the President to consult with the affected States regarding any oil discharges."
