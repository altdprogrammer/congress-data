Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to revoke a certain public land order with respect to specified Federal lands in Nevada. Establishes the Sunrise Mountain Study Area to conserve, protect, and enhance specified areas contained in and adjacent to Sunrise Mountain (Natural Area) Inventory Unit, Nevada. Directs the Secretary to study and report to specified congressional committees on resources, values, and management alternatives of the area. Authorizes appropriations.
