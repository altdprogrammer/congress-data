Repeals obsolete provisions establishing the Postal Service Advisory Council. Makes technical and conforming amendments with respect to appropriations, postal service fund, and postal rate provisions. Repeals provisions relating to diplomatic corps correspondence of the countries of the Postal Union of the Americas and Spain and star route certification. Adds provisions to: (1) provide that return receipts received in the courts shall be received as prima facie evidence of delivery; and (2) authorize the Postal Service to appoint uniformed guards with policing powers on Postal Service property. Authorizes the Postal Service and the State Department to test the feasibility of providing postal services through State Department personnel at overseas diplomatic missions and to establish branch post offices at overseas diplomatic missions at locations where postal services are not provided at armed forces installations. Amends the Charity Games Advertising Clarification Act of 1988 to revise provisions relating to false representations and lotteries to provide that the mailing of tickets or other materials concerning a State-conducted lottery to addresses within that State is not prohibited by that Act. Revises criminal code provisions concerning State-conducted lotteries to apply the definition of a lottery within such provisions to exceptions relating to certain advertisements and other information concerning a lottery conducted or authorized by a State. Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to provide that postal provisions concerning false representations and lotteries shall not apply to tribal gaming activities by Indians. Authorizes the Postal Service to grant administrative exceptions to a prohibition on mailing locksmithing devices."
