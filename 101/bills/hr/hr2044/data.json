Requires a veteran, in order to be eligible, to have a service-connected disability rated not less than 50 percent disabling. Limits the number of veterans to be so assisted. Requires the Secretary to determine if the veteran is suited for the provision of an assistive dog or monkey. Requires the Secretary to give a preference to veterans whose quadriplegia is service-connected. Outlines administrative provisions concerning such program, including determinations of suitability by the Secretary, the selection of veteran participants, funding for the program, and ownership of the assistive animals involved. Directs the Secretary, during FY 1990 through 1993, to conduct a pilot program for providing signal dogs (dogs trained to provide hearing assistance to the hearing-impaired) to veterans. Requires a veteran, in order to be eligible for such assistance, to have a service-connected hearing impairment and be in need of the assistance of a signal dog. Limits the number of veterans to participate in such program. Requires the Secretary to determine if the veteran is suited for the provision of a signal dog. Outlines administrative provisions concerning such program, including determinations of suitability by the Secretary, the selection of veteran participants, funding for the program, and ownership of the signal dog involved. Directs the Secretary to evaluate on an ongoing basis the pilot programs established under this Act. Directs the Secretary, no later than February 1, 1993, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the experience under the programs."
