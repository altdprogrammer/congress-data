(Current law delays such regulations until May 1, 1990, for inshore areas and May 1, 1989, for offshore areas.) Provides that such regulations shall not go into effect for inshore areas if determined that other conservation measures are equally effective in reducing sea turtle mortality by shrimp trawling. Requires the Secretary to modify such regulations accordingly."
