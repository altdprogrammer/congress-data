Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit an individual filing a joint income tax return to include a spouse's compensation in calculations to determine the maximum amount permitted as a deduction for qualified retirement contributions (thus permitting a nonworking or the lesser-earning spouse a deduction of up to $2,000 for IRA contributions)."
