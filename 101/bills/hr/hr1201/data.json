    "text": "Emergency Educational Facilities Repair and Renovation for Jobs Act - Title I: Elementary and Secondary Educational Facilities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1995 to the Department of Education to provide funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) to employ unemployed individuals in maintenance, repair, renovation, and reconstruction of public school facilities. Requires States desiring to receive a fund allocation to submit a statement of assurances to the Secretary of Education concerning further allocations to LEAs and compliance with fiscal control and fund accounting procedures. Directs the Secretary to allocate such funds among the States on the basis of relative numbers of: (1) unemployed residents; (2) unemployed residents of areas of substantial unemployment; (3) an excessive percentage of unemployed residents; and (4) low-income children. Requires that at least 70 percent of the funds made available to any LEA under this title be used for salaries and wages and associated benefits for individuals employed directly or indirectly by the LEA in facilities repair, renovation, or reconstruction programs. Requires that, to the maximum extent feasible, funds under this title be used for projects and activities for which on-site labor can begin within 90 days of receipt. Requires that such funds be used in accordance with State and local procedures for: (1) conforming to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and various government environmental protection or health and safety requirements; (2) public school facilities repair, renovation, and reconstruction; (3) conversion of presently unused structures into adult training centers; (4) energy efficiency remodeling or renovation; and (5) asbestos detection, removal, or containment in facilities used by students. Authorizes the Secretary, on request, to issue rulings to any SEAs or LEAs on the proper construction and application of this title. Title II: Reconstruction at Postsecondary Institutions and Renovation of Academic Facilities - Directs the Secretary to carry out programs of financial assistance to institutions of higher education and to higher education building agencies for the reconstruction or renovation of academic facilities and libraries if the primary purpose of such assistance is to enable such institutions to: (1) economize on the use of energy resources; (2) conform their academic facilities and libraries to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and various government environmental protection or health and safety requirements; (3) reconstruct and renovate research facilities; and (4) detect, remove, or contain asbestos hazards in facilities used by students. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1995 to the Department of Education to provide funds to States to employ unemployed individuals in maintenance, repair, renovation, and reconstruction of academic facilities at institutions of higher education. Sets forth fund allocation and fund use provisions similar to those for title I of this Act. Title III: Public Library Facilities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1995 to the Department of Education to provide funds for the repair, renovation, remodeling, and alteration of facilities for public libraries. Directs the Secretary to allot each State the minimum allotment specified under certain provisions of the Library Services and Construction Act. Provides for allocation of the remainder of such funds among the States on a basis similar to those for allocation under titles I and II of this Act. Sets forth provisions for use of funds which are similar to those under titles I and II of this Act. Directs State library administrative agencies, to the maximum extent feasible, to consider relative unemployment in each county in determining projects to be funded. Directs the Secretary to administer this title under existing regulations for title II (Public Library Construction) of the Library Services and Construction Act. Title IV: General Provisions - Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions and other general requirements. Prohibits the employment, in a subsidized wage position under this Act, of individuals who have voluntarily terminated without good cause, within the preceding six months, full-time employment at or exceeding the Federal minimum wage. Requires that individuals in employment subsidized under this Act be paid at either the highest of the Federal minimum wage, the applicable State or local minimum wage, or the prevailing wage for employment in similar occupations by the same employer. Sets forth standards relating to conditions of employment and training, health and safety standards, workers' compensation benefits, and job benefits and working conditions. Prohibits use of funds under this Act for contributions to retirement systems or plans on behalf of any participant. Prohibits displacement of any currently employed worker by participants in programs funded under this Act. Prohibits such programs from impairing existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements. Requires the written concurrence of the labor organization and the employer concerned before any such program which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement may be undertaken. Prohibits program participants from being employed or job openings from being filled when: (1) any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job; or (2) the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its work force with the intention of filling the vacancy by hiring a participant whose wages are subsidized under this Act. Prohibits creation of jobs in a promotional line that will infringe in any way on the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals. Requires recipients of funds under this Act to provide the Secretary with assurances that none will be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing. Applies the wage rate requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in works assisted under this Act."
