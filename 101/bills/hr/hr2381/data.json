    "text": "Information Policy Act of 1989 - Sets forth the following information dissemination functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget: (1) issuing, after notice and receipt of public comment, binding guidance for Federal agencies on the dissemination of public information products and services; (2) establishing oversight and enforcement procedures that will assure agency compliance with such guidance and permit appeals of agency actions affecting the availability of such products and services; (3) providing the development and maintenance of a public database index by Federal agencies; and (4) establishing an information policy issues committee to advise the Director. Requires the Director to issue uniform technical data standards to reduce the cost of using Federal-agency products disseminated on compact disk-read only memory. Authorizes the Director to issue standards for magnetic tape, magnetic disk, and other electronic information technologies. Requires the Director to review and report to the Congress on routine uses of records systems with respect to uniformity and consistency with the law and published guidelines. Amends provisions relating to requests for information to no longer require the Attorney General's annual report to include a description of Justice Department efforts to encourage agency compliance with public information requirements. Amends existing law to require agencies proposing changes in routine usage of records to provide a report to the Congress on potential effects on privacy or other individual rights. Requires agency heads to publish a description of the existence and character of each system of agency records. Declares that the U.S. Archivist shall have final authority in the executive branch to determine what constitutes a record for certain purposes."
