Increases the cigarette excise tax from: (1) $8 to $9 per thousand for small cigarettes; and (2) $16.80 to $18.90 for large cigarettes. Establishes in the Treasury the Anti-Drug Resource Enhancement Trust Fund, comprising an Anti-Illicit Drug Account and an Alcohol and Tobacco-Related Addiction Account. Appropriates to the former account 90 percent of the revenue attributable to the excise tax increases mandated in this Act, such amounts to be used to decrease the supply and demand for illicit narcotics through various anti-drug education, law enforcement, and treatment programs. Appropriates the remaining increased revenue to the latter account for research, prevention, education, treatment, and other programs for individuals addicted to alcohol or tobacco."
