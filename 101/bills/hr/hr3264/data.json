    "text": "Clean Environment Protection Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the disposal of solid waste in excess of 100 pounds in any State or political subdivision other than the State in which the waste was generated, unless the State or subdivision has consented to the disposal. Prohibits the sale of beer, mineral water, soda water, or carbonated soft drinks in beverage containers by retailers and distributors unless such containers carry a refund value of not less than five cents. Requires that retailers and distributors pay the refund on returned containers of brands sold by such retailers or distributors. Prohibits distributors and retailers from selling beverages in metal beverage containers with detachable openings. Preempts inconsistent State or local laws. Prohibits State and local governments from imposing any tax on the collection or return of refund values. Imposes penalties of up to $1,000 for violations. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to the Congress concerning: (1) means to increase the use of degradable materials in manufactured goods; (2) technologies for recycling nondurable consumer products; and (3) ways to expand the marketing of recycled products. Directs the Secretary to appoint a Director of Recycling Research and Information to: (1) make grants to support research into innovative recycling technology; and (2) gather and disseminate information on waste disposal and recycling technology. Describes possible research grant activities. Requires the Director to conduct a five-year outreach program to provide information regarding the importance of proper waste disposal and the benefits of, and methods to encourage, voluntary recycling. Sets forth a potential format for such program. Authorizes appropriations."
