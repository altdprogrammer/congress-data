    "text": "Marine Research Act of 1989 - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to support and implement regional marine research programs to plan, coordinate, and support research, monitoring, and assessment activities concerned with the quality of the marine environment. Directs the Regional Marine Research Oversight Board (Board) to consider proposals for such programs if the chief executive officers of a majority of States in a marine research region submit a proposal identifying the research organizations which will participate in the program and the goals of such program. Requires proposals for such programs to be developed by a Regional Marine Research Organizing Committee consisting of the Director of the Sea Grant Program in each State in the region. Identifies the marine research regions as the Gulf of Maine, Greater New York Bight, Mid-Atlantic Bight, Tropical, Gulf of Mexico, Southern California Bight, North Pacific, Gulf of Alaska and Arctic Seas, Insular Pacific, and Great Lakes Regions. Requires each program to develop and submit to the Board a three-year marine research and assessment plan which: (1) identifies research needs and priorities in the region over the next ten years; (2) inventories all projects regarding the marine environment expected to be conducted in the region; (3) describes each project expected to be assisted by grants made available under this Act; (4) reviews and discusses coordination of research and assessment projects which address issues common to neighboring regions; and (5) lists the equipment and supplies commonly used for projects in the region. Authorizes the Board to make annual administrative, research, and equipment grants to programs which submit applications for such grants. Limits and establishes preferences for such grants. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires each program to support baseline monitoring of fundamental marine environmental conditions and submit periodic reports on the status of marine environmental quality and resources in the region to the Board. Requires such reports to be made available to the public, State chief executive officers, and local, State, and Federal agencies. Establishes a Regional Marine Research Oversight Board at the Federal level to manage and coordinate the efforts of the programs and report periodically to the Congress on the activities and findings of such programs. Establishes the Regional Marine Research Trust Fund. Authorizes and allocates appropriations from the Fund to carry out this Act. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 to make moneys from the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund available for transfer to the Regional Marine Research Trust Fund."
