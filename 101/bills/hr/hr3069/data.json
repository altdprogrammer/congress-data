Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to: (1) make one competitive grant per State to an eligible State agency or a statewide nonprofit organization in any fiscal year for which the appropriation for this Act is less than a specified amount; and (2) in any fiscal year for which such appropriation equals or exceeds such amount, make grants to States according to an allocation formula based on relative adult populations. Reserves specified amounts for training and technical assistance and for administration and evaluation of programs. Sets forth requirements for the Secretary's awarding of competitive grants, including: (1) review and comment by the State Job Training Coordinating Council and the Governor; (2) priorities in selecting award recipients; and (3) annual competition for the one grant per State, with permissible waiver of competition if a grantee has performed satisfactorily in the preceding period and submits a satisfactory plan for the succeeding period. Authorizes the use of competitive grant funds for: (1) provision of services to displaced homemakers, including, but not limited to, referral services, supportive service assistance, career counseling, assessment, testing and evaluation, pre-employment services, basic skills, literacy and bilingual training, recruitment and outreach, job development and placement, follow-up services, and life skills development; and (2) statewide model and demonstration projects that provide special services for rural displaced homemakers, minority displaced homemakers, women aged 40 and older, and for nontraditional training or self-employment training. Limits administrative costs funding. Sets forth the formula for allocation of grants to States. Sets forth requirements for State plans. Directs the State Governor to designate as State administrative entity for programs under this Act either: (1) the existing State displaced homemaker unit; or (2) the State unit administering displaced homemaker single parent programs under the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. Requires the State administrative entity to: (1) make services available to displaced homemakers through eligible service providers; (2) develop an annual plan for use of program funds, manage and coordinate distribution of such funds, and monitor their use by eligible service providers; (3) set forth criteria for approving such providers' applications; (4) provide pre-service and in-service training, technical assistance, and advice to individuals providing services to displaced homemakers; and (5) gather, analyze, and disseminate data on the adequacy and effectiveness of the State in meeting displaced homemakers' needs for training and employment. Authorizes use of funds allocated to States to provide services to displaced homemakers, including those already listed. Requires that funds under this Act supplement but not supplant other public funds for such services. Limits to not more than five percent the portion of funds made available to any eligible service provider in any fiscal year which may be used to provide health care, meals, and temporary shelter. Prohibits use of funds under this Act to duplicate supportive services provided by any other source that are available to participants without cost. Limits administrative costs funding. Requires the State administrative agency to make competitive grants, from the State allotment, to eligible service providers to provide education, training-related, and supportive services to displaced homemakers. Requires competition to be annual except when waived for a grantee that performs satisfactorily and submits a satisfactory plan for the succeeding period. Limits reservation of funds for State administrative costs. Requires that the eligible service providers have demonstrated ability to deliver such services effectively. Gives priority to providers that have experience in providing them. Requires that community-based organizations, as defined under the Job Training Partnership Act, be given the opportunity to compete for such grants on an equitable basis with other eligible service providers. Direct the Secretary, from certain reserved funds, to implement a uniform data collection system to collect from States specified types of information relating to displaced homemakers and education and training services for them. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish procedures for program administration, monitoring, and evaluation; and (2) report biennially to the Congress on program evaluations and on funds and services available for displaced homemakers. Authorizes the Secretary to provide, through grants and contracts, training and technical assistance to statewide public agencies or statewide nonprofit organizations serving displaced homemakers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and succeeding fiscal years to carry out this Act."
