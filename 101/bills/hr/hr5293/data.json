    "date": "1990-07-17", 
    "text": "Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1990 - Title I: International Efforts to Reduce Illegal Drug Production and Drug Trafficking - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should direct the Secretary of State to negotiate with the Governments of Canada and Mexico for the establishment of a North American Narcotics Council which would explore ways and means of facilitating the exchange of information (both in antinarcotics efforts and in substance abuse reduction and education programs), increasing cooperation in antinarcotics efforts, and improving efforts to supply assistance to source and trafficking countries, and reducing through other areas and programs the demand and supply of illicit narcotics and psychotropic substances. Requires the President to submit to the Congress, for each fiscal year in which the United States participates in the Council, a budget request to cover the expenses of such participation. Sets forth provisions for the appointment of a permanent U.S. representative and congressional advisors to the Council, provisions for termination of such Council, and reporting requirements. Requires the President, with respect to each year after 1989, to determine whether: (1) there was a reduction in the quantity of illicit coca produced or in illicit coca activities in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru; and (2) any reduction is attributable to the implementation of social or economic alternatives in such countries. Authorizes the President, if an affirmative determination with respect to such a country is made and the Congress enacts a law approving it, to apply special trade treatment to articles that: (1) are products of such country; and (2) are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption in U.S. customs territory in the year following the year such determination was made. Specifies that if the granting of such special trade treatment would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, provisions of this Act shall be inapplicable until the President obtains a waiver of the provision which is the basis for such violation. Prohibits such special treatment if specified actions under the Narcotics Control Trade Act are in effect with respect to such country or if such treatment is restricted under countervailing duties or trade dumping regulations. Authorizes appropriations for additional economic assistance grants for the Governments of Bolivia and Peru, to be made available only after consummation of a written agreement between such governments and the United States outlining specific, verifiable illicit coca eradication plans resulting in a 50 percent eradication of the illicit coca crop by the end of FY 1993, and a 100 percent eradication by the end of FY 1996. Requires the Secretary of State to negotiate such bilateral agreements on behalf of the United States and to have primary responsibility for verifying the actual eradication of illicit coca in Bolivia and Peru. Authorizes the use of funds under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) for training and equipment for law enforcement agencies or other units in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru that are organized for the specific purpose of enforcing narcotics laws. Waives, during FY 1991 through 1993: (1) specified provisions limiting assistance to countries in default on obligations owed to the United States with respect to narcotics-related assistance under the FAA or AECA for a country that is a \"major illicit drug producing country\" because of its coca production; and (2) any provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act that prohibit the use of FAA funds for activities in connection with the growth or production in a foreign country of an agricultural commodity for export which would compete with a similar commodity grown or produced in the United States with respect to assistance for crop substitution and alternative development activities undertaken in furtherance of narcotics control objectives.
