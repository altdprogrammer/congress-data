Directs the Secretary to establish military relocation assistance programs to provide the following types of relocation assistance: (1) destination area information and preparation; (2) certain counseling services related to relocation adjustments; (3) settling-in services; and (4) home-finding services. Requires each military installation with at least 500 members to have such a program and any military installation with less than 500 members to have access to such a program. Requires program information to be managed through a computerized information program that can interact with all other such programs. Directs the Secretary to appoint a Military Relocation Assistance Programs Director in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense to oversee development and implementation of this Act. Provides funding for each such program. Requires the Director to report to the Congress each year on: (1) the assessment of available housing for relocating military families; (2) the assessment of costs incurred by relocating military members and their families; (3) data on where members of the armed forces live; and (4) data on the effects of relocation assistance programs on the quality of life of members of the armed forces and their families and on the retention and productivity of members of the armed forces."
