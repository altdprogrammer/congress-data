Bars any such exempt network from interrupting live action in the broadcasting of an olympic contest with a commercial. Prohibits any network from entering into an agreement to broadcast the Olympics unless such agreement is approved by the U.S. Olympic Committee. Specifies that a violation of such prohibition shall be considered to be a violation of the Communications Act of 1934. Bars any network from entering into an agreement to subcontract the broadcasting rights to the Olympics to any other party without the prior approval of the U.S. Olympic Committee."
