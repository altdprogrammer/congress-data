    "text": "Long-Term Care Insurance Standards Act of 1989 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a procedure whereby long-term care insurance policies may be certified as meeting minimum standards and requirements set forth in this Act. Allows the certification to remain in effect if the insurer files a notarized statement annually with the Secretary stating that the policy continues to meet the standards and requirements. Authorizes printing of an emblem designed by the Secretary on certified policies. Deems any long-term care insurance policy issued in any State, if the Long-Term Care Insurance Panel determines that the State has requirements equal to or more stringent than those in this Act, to meet the standards and requirements of this Act, provided that, if required by State law, each advertisement for the policy is submitted before its use to the State insurance commissioner for approval. Establishes the Long-Term Care Insurance Panel. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth requirements a policy must meet in order to be certified, including meeting standards reprinted in December 1988 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Sets forth criminal penalties for certain acts, including: (1) misrepresentations; and (2) knowingly mailing an advertisement or a policy in or into a State in which the policy has not been approved by the State insurance commissioner. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the right of any State to regulate long-term care insurance policies that, under this Act, are considered to be issued in another State."
