Disallows such individuals from having any contact with defense subcontracts or subcontractors during such prohibition. Prohibits the Secretaries of the military departments from allowing the award of DOD subcontracts to suspended or debarred contractors (current law prohibits the approval of such subcontracts). Provides that, in the case of any DOD contact with respect to which the Secretary of Defense is required to approve the contractor's purchasing system, approval will be withdrawn if the contractor awards a subcontract to a contractor who has been suspended or debarred from Government contracting or subcontracting, except where the contractor has established procedures fully protecting the Government's interests. Directs the Secretary to require each DOD contractor to require each of its subcontractors to certify that the subcontractor is not debarred or suspended from Government contracting or subcontracting at the time of the contract award."
