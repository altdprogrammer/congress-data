Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress, the Governor of the Virgin Islands, and the Governor of Puerto Rico a report on the results of such assessment. Provides that, upon request of the Governor of the Virgin Islands, the Federal official administering assistance for a construction project in the Virgin Islands may make such assistance available to the Secretary instead of the Virgin Islands. Declares that the maximum amount which may be allotted under the Flood Control Act of 1948 for the flood control project for Savan Gut, Virgin Islands, shall be $10,000,000 instead of $5,000,000. Waives the $5,000,000 limitation on obligations for projects in a fiscal year in the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands with respect to obligations for projects resulting from Hurricane Hugo. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide not less than two Federal Highway Administration technicians to provide assistance in repairing and reconstructing portions of the Federal-aid highway system in the Virgin Islands damaged or destroyed as a result of Hurricane Hugo."
