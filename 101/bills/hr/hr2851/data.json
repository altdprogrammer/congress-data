Provides coverage for post-hospital home health services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that determinations made under Medicare provisions by fiscal intermediaries and carriers with respect to coverage of home health services and post-hospital extended care services are based upon uniform criteria of nationwide application. Permits a hospice care beneficiary to obtain covered home intravenous drug therapy services and in-home care if they are included in his or her hospice plan of care."
