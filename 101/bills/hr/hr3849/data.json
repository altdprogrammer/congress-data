Requires printing and other information products and services authorized by law, which the Public Printer is not able or equipped to do at GPO, to be produced elsewhere under contracts made by the Public Printer with the approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. Requires the Superintendent of Documents to include data on information services in the comprehensive index of public documents. Authorizes the Superintendent to allow depository libraries access to information services subject to agreement between the Superintendent and the Government component issuing the service on the terms and conditions of access, including cost sharing arrangements."
