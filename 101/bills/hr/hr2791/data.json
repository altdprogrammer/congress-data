    "text": "Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to direct the Secretary of the Interior (acting through the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement) to administer programs promoting the reclamation of abandoned mine lands by active surface coal mining operators. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or reduce the surface coal mining reclamation fee for certain persons engaged in approved remining activities. Directs the Secretary to establish standards and procedures for determining applicant eligibility for environmental or financial incentives for the remining of previously mined areas (any area disturbed by coal mining activity prior to August 3, 1977). Precludes mountain top removal applications from being either administratively approved or from obtaining any incentive award for remining a previously mined area. Outlines the application requirements and approval standards for financial or environmental incentive awards. Restricts the amount that may be expended from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for research on remining equipment."
