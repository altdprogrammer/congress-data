Adds $1,000, until the year 2002, to the annual outside income which a beneficiary may earn without incurring a benefit reduction. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct an ongoing study to determine whether further modifications of the treatment of a beneficiary's outside income are necessary or appropriate. Sets forth reporting requirements."
