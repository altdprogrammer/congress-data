    "text": "Prohibits an agency from requesting or requiring that an employee submit to a drug test unless at least two individuals having supervisory or oversight authority with respect to such employee concur that: (1) the employee's performance is impaired; and (2) there is reason to believe the impairment is due to the employee's being under the influence of a controlled substance. Declares that an employee having a positive result in a drug test may be requested or required to submit to a confirmatory drug test. Authorizes an agency to take action against any employee who tests positive in a confirmatory drug test, or who refuses to submit to a confirmatory drug test. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to establish general guidelines to carry out this Act. Authorizes persons aggrieved by a violation of this Act to bring a civil action in the appropriate U.S. district court. Declares that employees subject to collective bargaining agreements shall not be subject to drug tests: (1) if, or to the extent, such tests would violate such agreement; or (2) if drug tests are not covered by such agreement, unless or until there has been consultation in accordance with applicable law. Declares that this Act does not apply to employees of the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. Makes this Act applicable to an executive agency, a military department, a court of the United States, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the Library of Congress, the Botanic Garden, and the Government Printing Office."
