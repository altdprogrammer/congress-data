    "text": "Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Amendments Act of 1990 - Declares it to be the Federal Government's responsibility to: (1) provide an opportunity for updating skills of teachers of mathematics and science in elementary and secondary schools; (2) make information available to local educational agencies (LEAs) regarding updated mathematics and science instructional materials; (3) conduct clearinghouse and dissemination activities so that successful programs and curricula can be replicated; and (4) establish a central listing of all sources of Federal assistance to mathematics and science education. Amends the Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act (the Act) to increase the amounts authorized to be appropriated for FY 1991 through 1993 for State grants and national programs. Revises in-State apportionment provisions to require any LEA which receives less than a specified amount to form a consortium with at least one other LEA or higher education institution, with specified exceptions. Requires LEAS, with specified exceptions, to first use any amount of their allocation in excess of the FY 1990 amount to provide training for mathematics and science teachers in elementary and middle schools. Revises certain limitations on the amount of program funds which may be used for assessment and administrative costs for higher education programs. Provides for: (1) a National Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Materials; and (3) model programs for instruction and training in the use of computers. Provides for Regional Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Consortia. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to award grants to such consortia to disseminate and implement exemplary science, mathematics, and technology education instruction materials, teaching methods, and assessment tools for use by elementary and secondary education. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993 for such consortia. Directs the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a report listing all sources of Federal aid to mathematics and science education."
