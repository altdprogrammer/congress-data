Provides formulae for determining: (1) the amount disallowed if the taxpayer received property other than a substantially identical debt pool; and (2) the basis of any such debt pool received in an exchange. Requires that the taxable income of mutual savings and other such banks be reduced by net operating loss carrybacks for purposes of calculating the bad debt reserve deduction under the percentage of taxable income method."
