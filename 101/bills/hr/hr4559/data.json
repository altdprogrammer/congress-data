Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with governmental and nonprofit entities providing for the management and interpretation of natural and cultural resources in the conservation area. Reserves to the United States the amount of water needed to implement the purposes of the conservation area only. Authorizes appropriations. Declares that the Congress does not intend for the establishment of the conservation area to lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the conservation area."
