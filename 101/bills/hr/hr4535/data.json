Prohibits an agency head from collecting on a Federal claim by administrative offset if such claim is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Applies the ordinary administrative offset as well as penalty and interest rules to debtors which are State or local government agencies. Permits the recovery of interest that has accrued on a Federal claim prior to certain notice requirements. Extends a certain debt collection pilot program regarding contracts for collection services."
