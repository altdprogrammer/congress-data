    "text": "Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Act of 1990 - Title I: United States Coast Guard Regulations - Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, through the Commandant of the Coast Guard, to promulgate regulations to prevent and control the transportation into U.S. waters of viable biological materials in ship ballast waters. Mandates the use of a high sea ballast water exchange or alternative methods developed and recommended by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to prevent the unintentional transfer or introduction of nonindigenous species by ships operating exclusively within U.S. territorial waters or contiguous coastal waters of North America. Exempts such ships from the high seas exchange requirement of this Act. Exempts from the high seas exchange requirement a ship that is subject to requirements regarding the treatment of ballast water for the removal of chemical contaminants. Authorizes the Secretary to assess civil monetary penalties for violation of the regulations. Makes civil penalties available, as provided by appropriation Acts, to endow research on the control of nonindigenous species. Title II: Zebra Mussel and Aquatic Nuisance Species Research, Control, and Educational Program - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (National Cooperative Action Group - NCAG), to jointly coordinate national research, control, and educational efforts associated with the infestation of the zebra mussel and other aquatic nuisance species in U.S. waters. Authorizes the NCAG to establish and coordinate regional commissions as necessary and to facilitate information transfer among the commissions. Authorizes Federal agency heads, on request of the chairman of any commission, to detail personnel to the commission. Requires the NCAG to provide advice to the Secretary of State concerning aquatic nuisance species that infest water resources shared with other countries. Requires the NCAG to establish a regional commission for the Great Lakes region and to request that the Great Lakes Fishery Commission: (1) designate a representative to serve on it; (2) advise, coordinate, and provide secretarial services on matters related to Great Lakes fisheries, related environmental concerns, and interactions with the Government of Canada; and (3) provide technical services for any technical committee established by the NCAG. Requires that the NCAG request that the Great Lakes Commission (established under the Great Lakes Basin Compact): (1) designate a representative to serve on the regional commission; (2) advise, coordinate, and provide secretarial services on matters related to the economic impacts of the zebra mussel on the geographic area of the Great Lakes; and (3) provide technical services for any technical committee established by the NCAG. Requires that research activities under this Act be carried out only in drainage basins infested with an aquatic nuisance species, with research funds allocated, to the extent possible, to existing facilities within infested areas. Sets forth research priorities. Directs the Secretary of State to initiate negotiations with foreign governments concerning prevention, research, education, and control programs for shared water resources. Requires compliance with specified treaties relating to the Great Lakes. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to declare the zebra mussel an injurious species. Requires the appropriate lead agency to allocate funds authorized under this Act for competitive university research grants to be administered through the Sea Grant College program to study aquatic nuisance species. Authorizes the program to conduct education and assistance services related to the prevention and control of such species. Authorizes appropriations."
