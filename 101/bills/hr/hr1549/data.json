    "text": "Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 - Authorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and for its Office of the Inspector General for FY 1990 and 1991. Prescribes allocation guidelines. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Commission annually to assess and collect user fees for services rendered as well as annual charges to certain utilization facility licensees in amounts sufficient to cover the cost of providing regulatory services. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to repeal the requirement that the Commission submit to certain congressional committees a feasibility study regarding user charges. Prohibits funds appropriated under this Act from being used in connection with either: (1) the termination of the Shoreham Nuclear Powerplant operating license; or (2) its transfer to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA). Stipulates that if the operating license is transferred to a third party other than LIPA, then appropriated funds may be used to decommission the plant if the Commission determines that it is unsafe to operate it. Prohibits the Commission from taking any action permitting tritium production for nuclear explosive purposes in facilities under its purview."
