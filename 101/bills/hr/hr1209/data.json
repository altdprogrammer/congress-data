Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to declare the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress to be that which is in effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Limits annual adjustments in congressional pay to three percent of the annual rate. Makes it out of order in the House or Senate to consider any bill or resolution which adjusts the pay of Members, unless the bill or resolution: (1) takes effect at the beginning of the following Congress; and (2) deals with no subject matter other than congressional pay. Requires a record vote on such legislation."
