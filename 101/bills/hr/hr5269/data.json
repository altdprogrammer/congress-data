    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-23", 
    "text": "Title I: Death Penalty - Federal Death Penalty Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits information to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Includes as threshold aggravating factors for homicide that the defendant: (1) intentionally killed the victim; (2) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury which resulted in the death of the victim; (3) intentionally participated in an act, contemplating that the life of a person would be taken, and the victim died as a direct result of the act; (4) attempted to kill the President of the United States; or (5) intentionally engaged in an act constituting reckless disregard for human life, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death to someone other than the participants, and the victim died as a direct result of the act. Sets forth special aggravating factors with respect to the crimes of treason, espionage, homicide, and attempted murder of the President. States that no person who was less than 17 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons or pregnant women. Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified based on consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating factors. Requires the court to instruct the jury: (1) not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or any victim in its consideration of the sentence; and (2) that it is not required to return a death sentence. Requires, prior to hearing any case to determine whether a death sentence is justified and as part of the presentence investigation, the preparation of a victim impact statement which identifies the victim, the physical injury caused, any request for psychological services initiated by the victim as a result of the offense, and any other information related to the impact of the offense on the victim or victim's family as the court may require. Specifies that: (1) the required information may be obtained from the personal guardian of the victim or from family members; and (2) such statement shall be considered by the court or jury. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the Court of Appeals, upon considering the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was imposed under influence of passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or any provider of services under contract to participate in any execution if participation is contrary to his or her moral or religious convictions. Bars the imposition of a death sentence for first degree murder committed by or against an Indian in Indian country unless there was in effect at the time of the offense an election by the governing body of the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the place where the offense was committed to have this title apply in such cases. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (4) murder for hire; (5) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (6) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; and (7) other specified offenses. Title II: Habeas Corpus Reform - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by defendants subject to capital punishment and prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence. Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable fees and litigation expenses of competent counsel consistent with this title. Sets forth procedures for the appointment of counsel. Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act. Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire. Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless: (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented by the prisoner in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of Supreme Court recognition of a new fundamental right that is retroactively applicable, or is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the filing of any successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus is authorized by the appropriate court of appeals and the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed or newly discovered facts are not based upon opinion evidence which would be sufficient to undermine the court's confidence in the validity of the death sentence. Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief. Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable with an exception. States that a mechanism for the provision of counsel services to indigents sufficient to invoke the provisions of this title shall provide for: (1) counsel to indigents charged with offenses for which capital punishment is sought, to those who have been sentenced to death and who seek appellate or collateral review in State court, and to those who have been sentenced to death and seek certiorari review in the U.S. Supreme Court; and (2) the entry of an order of a court of record appointing one or more counsels to represent the prisoner except upon a judicial determination (after a hearing, if necessary) that the prisoner is not indigent or knowingly waives the appointment of counsel. Requires at least one attorney appointed pursuant to this title before trial and one appointed after trial, if applicable, to be certified by a statewide certification authority, with exceptions. Authorizes the States to elect to create between one and three certification authorities (i.e., a special committee constituted by the State court of last resort or by State law, a capital litigation resource center, or a statewide defender organization to: (1) certify attorneys qualified to represent persons charged with capital offenses or sentenced to death; (2) draft and annually publish procedures and standards by which attorneys are certified and rosters of certified attorneys; and (3) periodically review the roster of certified attorneys, monitor the performance of all attorneys certified, and withdraw certification from any attorney who fails to meet high performance standards or to demonstrate continuing competence to represent prisoners in capital litigation. Authorizes the payment of fees and expenses for investigative, expert, or other services reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant. Directs the court to fix the compensation to be paid to an attorney appointed under this title. Specifies which law controls in Federal habeas corpus proceedings. Sets forth habeas corpus time requirements. Specifies that an applicant for habeas corpus in a capital case shall be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State when the applicant has exhausted any right to direct appeal in the State. Title III: Use of Firearms in Crimes of Violence and Drug Trafficking Crimes - Amends the Federal criminal code to increase mandatory minimum sentences for criminals using firearms and for other violent criminals. (Under current law, whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or any drug trafficking crime, uses or carries a firearm, in addition to the punishment provided for the underlying crime, is subject to imprisonment for five years or, if a machinegun or firearm equipped with a silencer is involved, 30 years and for subsequent offenses, 20 years or life imprisonment without release, respectively. Under this Act, such criminals would receive additional sentences of not less than ten years for possession of a firearm, 20 years for discharging a firearm with intent to injure, or 30 years for possession of a machinegun or a firearm equipped with a silencer (all without release.) Provides for enhanced penalties for third and subsequent convictions. Defines \"possession\" of a firearm to include: (1) in the case of a crime of violence, touching a firearm at the crime scene at any time during the commission of the crime; and (2) in the case of a drug trafficking crime, having a firearm readily available at the crime scene during the commission of the crime. Makes this section inapplicable to persons found to have committed criminal acts while acting in defense of person or property during the course of a crime being committed by another person. Sets forth penalties of up to ten years' imprisonment and a fine for stealing firearms and for smuggling firearms with intent to engage in or promote certain drug-related or violent offenses. Provides for mandatory revocation of supervised release for possession of a firearm. Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to increase prison sentences for selling illegal drugs to minors and for the use of minors in drug trafficking activities. Provides for life imprisonment without release for those convicted a third time of a felony drug offense. Title IV: Assault Weapons - Antidrug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer, importation, receipt, or possession of any assault weapon, except: (1) by the Federal, State, or local government; and (2) with respect to weapons lawfully possessed before enactment of this Act. Specifies firearms to be included as assault weapons. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to recommend to the Congress the addition or deletion of firearms to be designated as assault weapons. Increases the length of imprisonment for an individual who uses or carries an assault weapon during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Prohibits the sale, shipment, or delivery (or purchase, possession, or acceptance of delivery) of an assault weapon to (or by) any person who does not fill out a specified form. Establishes recordkeeping requirements. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the request and delivery of such form.
