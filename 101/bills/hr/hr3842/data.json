Requires the focus of such program to be the release of sea turtles into the Gulf of Mexico and other locations, as necessary, for the conservation of such turtles. Directs the Secretary to construct captive maintenance facilities, monitor the results of the headstart program, and expand and accelerate ongoing research on sea turtle ecology. Limits the Federal share of such program to 75 percent of the total cost. Permits State, local governments, or private entities to contribute to the non-Federal share of such program. Authorizes appropriations."
