    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-04-27", 
    "text": "Excellence in Government Management Act of 1989 - Includes as a condition for designating a civil service position as a career reserved position (one reserved for a career appointee) that such position must have the principal responsibility of managing career employees. Provides that calculations of the number of noncareer appointees be based upon the number of senior executives employed in the Senior Executive Service during the preceding fiscal year. Limits the maximum number of positions excepted from competitive service because of their confidential or policy-determining character to 1000. Restricts such limitation to positions for which the basic pay is GS-13 or above. Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report to specified congressional committees with respect to any individual who is appointed to a position within the competitive service or to the Senior Executive Service as a career appointee if, at any time during the six-month period ending on the effective date of the appointment, such individual served under a noncareer appointment in any agency, including the Executive Office of the President. Directs OPM to establish a qualifications review board to certify the executive qualifications of candidates for initial appointment as career appointees. (Currently OPM has the authority to establish one or more such boards.) Directs OPM to establish a qualifications review board to certify the executive qualifications of candidates for initial appointment as noncareer, limited term, or limited emergency appointees. Authorizes an agency to pay from its appropriations a geographic relocation benefit to any career appointee reassigned to a Senior Executive Service position outside the career appointee's commuting area, if such individual agrees to serve in the Government for 12 months after such reassignment. Authorizes the payment of such benefit for any career appointee who is transferred to another position in a different agency. Authorizes the President to prescribe regulations under which an agency may enter into an agreement with a career appointee to pay relocation benefits when such appointee is ready to retire. Provides that any days (not to exceed 60 days) during which a career appointee serves a detail or other temporary assignment apart from such appointee's regular position shall not be counted in determining the number of days that have elapsed from such individual's initial appointment. Directs OPM to provide appropriate informational services and otherwise encourage career appointees to take advantage of any opportunities relating to: (1) sabbaticals; (2) training; or (3) details or other temporary assignments in other agencies, State or local government, or the private sector. Changes from biennial to annual the report by OPM to the Congress on the Senior Executive Service. Requires the OPM to include in such report information on applications for sabbaticals. Authorizes agencies, under guidelines established by OPM, to establish a fellowship program for individuals pursuing post-secondary degrees in fields of study for which the Government requires proficiency or expertise. Sets forth general requirements, including work requirements, for participation in such program. Directs OPM to establish regulations for training programs for members of the Senior Executive Service, supervisors, and management officials. Requires the Director of OPM to establish a training program designed to acquaint noncareer appointees with government operations, civil service procedures, public management practices, and ethical standards for public servants. Provides for adjusting the presidential rank award amounts by percentage adjustments in the rates of pay under the General Schedule. Requires the Director to establish and periodically consult with: (1) a panel of career appointees recognized for their knowledge, interest, and experience with respect to matters of executive management or for the excellence of their performance as senior executives; and (2) a panel of employees holding career appointments in the civil service and recommended by labor organizations or other organizations representing the interests of employees. Declares that any payments made under this Act shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided for in advance by appropriation Acts."
