Sets forth procedures and requirements for a State to apply for such a grant, including a reasonable assurance that the State will use non-Federal funds to pay at least half of the total cost for the construction of the facility. Establishes criteria for approval of grant applications. Authorizes the United States to recover funds calculated according to a specified formula from a State receiving a grant if, within ten years, the State ceases to operate the facility as a maximum security correctional facility or repeals its career criminal laws. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
