Revises the use of State program funds to include grants to promote and establish drug-free school zones.

Adds juveniles in detention facilities to the list of high-risk youths. Allows the use of State program funds for nondiscriminatory random drug testing programs for students voluntarily participating in athletic activities in schools which voluntarily choose to participate in such a program.

Revises provisions for State educational agency responsibilities with respect to reallocation of grants to local and intermediate education agencies. Revises local drug abuse education and prevention programs.
