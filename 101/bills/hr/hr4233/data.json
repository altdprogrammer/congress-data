Makes deductibles inapplicable to services provided by such health centers. Permits such centers to waive Medicare coinsurance requirements when providing services to individuals who qualify for subsidized services under the Public Health Service Act. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve or disapprove a rural health clinic's application for certification within 60 days of the State agency's determination that the clinic qualifies for rural health clinic status. Establishes a temporary one-year waiver of certain staffing requirements for rural health clinics that, despite reasonable efforts, have been unable to hire appropriate personnel. Requires that productivity screening guidelines take into account the combined services of a rural health clinic's staff. Gives rural health clinics and health centers covered by this Act the same appeal and hearing rights as other Medicare providers. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to the Congress on whether physicians practicing in community and migrant health centers are able to obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals."
