Imposes a duty on the Board to use prudent person standards in overseeing the investment of OASDI funds for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits for OASDI beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses in administering such funds. Limits the proportion of such funds which may be invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States."
