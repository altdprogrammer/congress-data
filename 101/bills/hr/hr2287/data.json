    "text": "Advanced Television Competitiveness Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide for the establishment of an industry-led consortium, to be known as TV Tech, to conduct research, development, and manufacturing activities in the field of high definition television and other advanced television systems. Outlines membership provisions concerning TV Tech. Requires the Directorate of TV Tech (the controlling group) to appoint from among employees of firms that are members of TV Tech a Commercial Coordinating Group to coordinate and advise on the commercially related activities of TV Tech and a Technical Coordinating Group to coordinate and advise on the technical activities of TV Tech. Requires the Directorate to establish a variety of projects related to advanced television system technologies, each to be supervised by a project leader. Provides a Project Leaders Coordinating Group to facilitate the sharing among projects of costs, planning, and the dissemination of obtained information. Establishes an Advisory Council on Federal Participation in TV Tech to: (1) advise the Directorate on appropriate goals for activities; and (2) conduct an annual review of TV Tech activities to determine progress made in achieving the purposes of this Act. Outlines membership and funding provisions for the Council. Provides that the conduct of any person making or performing a contract to carry out activities authorized by this Act shall not be considered illegal per se under antitrust laws, but shall be judged on the basis of its reasonableness. Provides that, for the purposes of damages recovery and attorneys' fees, conduct authorized by this Act shall be considered within the scope of a notification under appropriate provisions of the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984. Permits TV Tech to enter into contracts which would result in the transfer to any person outside the United States of technology developed in the United States only when authorized by the Directorate, in consultation with the Advisory Council. Permits a non-U.S.-owned firm to obtain licensing rights from TV Tech with respect to technology developed in the United States only if: (1) all royalties connected with such license are retained by TV Tech or a U.S.-owned firm; and (2) all components are manufactured in the United States, unless special circumstances warrant otherwise. Provides for reversion to TV Tech of all patents held by a member firm of TV Tech which ceases to be a U.S.-owned firm. Allows research and development programs undertaken by TV Tech to culminate in pilot projects as appropriate. Authorizes TV Tech to enter into agreements with a State to encourage development of full-scale projects at the State level."
