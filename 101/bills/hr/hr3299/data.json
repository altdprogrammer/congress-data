Requires the Secretary to reduce such percentage (or even prohibit such plantings) if it is estimated, based on the anticipated additional soybean, sunflower, and safflower plantings, that the average market price for the 1990 soybean crop will be below 110 percent of the loan rate for the 1989 crop. Requires a report to the appropriate congressional committees. Counts any acreage planted to soybeans, sunflowers, or safflowers as acreage planted to the program crop for which they are substituted. Sets forth a sliding-scale of acreage limitations and reductions for the 1990 crop of feed grains. Makes across-the-board reductions in deficiency payments for the 1990 crops of: (1) wheat and corn, by 2.33 cents per bushel; (2) cotton, by .515 cents per pound; and (3) rice, by .515 cents per hundred-weight. Amends the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 to declare that refunds of advance deficiency payments may not be required: (1) before December 31, 1989, (currently July 31) for producers of 1988 crops of wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton if they suffered losses of 1988 or 1989 crops due to a natural disaster; or (2) before July 31, 1990, for any such 1988 deficiency payments. Prohibits the Commodity Credit Corporation during FY 1990 from making more than $566,000,000 in commodities available to exporters, processors, or foreign importers in order to enhance the export of U.S. commodities by making their prices competitive in the world market. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to reduce the amount of targeted export assistance available for FY 1990 from $325,000,000 to $200,000,000. Delays until October 1, 1992, the effective date of certain Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (FAC) stock purchase requirements of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended by the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1989. Requires that FAC make, out of its Trust Fund, four annual payments (calculated according to specified formulae) to each institution of the Farm Credit System that purchased FAC stock. Makes such installments payable as soon as practicable after October 1 of each of the calendar years 1989 through 1992. Directs the Secretary, during calendar year 1990, to offer to buy butter at no more than $1.10 per pound. Permits the Secretary to allocate the rate of price support between the purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and butter in any other manner determined to result in the lowest level of expenditures by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Requires notification of the appropriate congressional committees of such a determination. Makes the mandatory 50 percent cut in the price support for milk discretionary. Title II: Student Loan and Pension Fiduciary Amendments - Subtitle A: Student Loan Reconciliation Amendments - Student Loan Reconciliation Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise provisions relating to repayment of student loans by medical residents.

Requires lenders to grant borrowers, upon written request, forbearance from student loan repayments, renewable at 12-month intervals, for the time remaining in the borrower's medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship program. Prohibits lenders from: (1) charging an administrative or other fee in connection with granting such a forbearance; or (2) reporting adverse information regarding a borrower solely because of granting such a forbearance. Revises HEA provisions relating to the Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) program. Prohibits borrowing of funds under the SLS program at an institution of higher education by any undergraduate student if that institution had a cohort default rate of 30 percent or more with respect to repayment of student loans under the SLS or the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs. Revises maximum annual limits on individual student loan amounts under the SLS program. Makes ability-to-benefit students ineligible for the SLS program until they have obtained a high school diploma or equivalency certificate. Requires institutions which admit ability-to-benefit students to make available to them a program proven successful in assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency certificate. Sets forth additional requirements with respect to the disbursement of GSL and SLS loans. Requires multiple disbursement of such student loans, with minimum intervals between first and second installments. Prohibits endorsements of the first installment of an SLS loan to a new student borrower entering the first undergraduate year until 30 days after the borrower begins a course of study, but allows such installment to be delivered to the eligible institution prior to the end of the 30-day period.

Directs the Secretary to consult with a representative group of guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and eligible institutions to develop a mutually agreeable proposal for the establishment of a National Student Loan Data System. (Such a system is currently authorized but not mandated.) Authorizes the Secretary to require lenders, guaranty agencies, and institutions to verify information or eligibility through such system before making, guaranteeing, or certifying student loans. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on the results obtained through such system. Provides that nothing in title IV limits the authority of student financial aid administrators to: (1) make necessary adjustments to the cost of attendance and expected student and/or parent contribution under special circumstances; or (2) use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstance of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining award amounts under specified student assistance programs.

Subpart A: Amendments Related to Tax Reform Act of 1986 - Amends the Reform Act, ERISA, and the IRC (as amended by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988) to revise pension-related provisions. Revises minimum vesting requirements to provide a special vesting rule by which the repeal of class-year vesting does not adversely affect the vesting status of certain plan participants. Applies such exemption rule to any employee for whom such a plan amendment eliminating class-year vesting would reduce a nonforfeitable right and who has an hour of service: (1) before the adoption of such plan amendment; and (2) on or after the first day of the first plan year for which the repeal of class-year vesting would be applicable. Limits such exemption rule to those employees who have not incurred a five-year break in service immediately before the hour of service after the plan amendment is applicable. Provides that compliance with this special vesting rule shall not be considered a violation of the minimum participation rule. Allows the assets of a qualified pension plan in excess of its liabilities to be transferred to a welfare benefit plan upon the pension plan's termination if such assets are to be used to provide retiree benefits, and if: (1) both such plans are jointly administered pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement; (2) the welfare benefit plan provides retiree health benefits; and (3) the pension plan has assets in excess of liabilities (determined on a termination basis) and the welfare benefit plan has assets which are less than the value of the benefits to be provided under the plan (determined as of the time of termination of the pension plan). Treats any such transfer of assets, for IRC purposes, as a reversion of assets to the employer maintaining the plan, which is includible in gross income and subject to specified provisions. Amends the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (as well as the Reform Act and ERISA) to revise plan amendment deadlines. Amends ERISA, the IRC, the Reform Act, and the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 to revise continuation coverage requirements for group health plans. Provides that if a covered employee has a qualifying event that results in 18 months of continuation coverage and such covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare before the 18 months expires, then a qualified beneficiary other than the covered employee is entitled to continuation coverage for a total of 36 months after the original qualifying event. Provides for termination of continuation coverage in the case of preexisting condition.
