    "date": "1989-05-24", 
    "text": "Title I: General Provisions - Merchant Marine and Defense Act of 1989 - Sets forth congressional findings regarding the maritime industries and national defense. Declares that it is the policy of the United States to develop the necessary maritime resources to meet U.S. national defense and economic security requirements. Title II: Operating Differential Subsidy Reform - Amends provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 relating to the operating-differential subsidy (ODS) to: (1) allow the Secretary of Transportation, in determining whether to approve an application or revise a contract, to consider the availability of funding; and (2) prohibit the Secretary, in making such determinations, from making a distinction between persons already receiving such aid and new applicants. Revises the definition of \"essential service\" to include any operation determined by the Secretary to be necessary for national defense or for competitive and economical operation of U.S.-flag vessels in foreign commerce. Requires, for ODS aid, that a vessel be a militarily useful dry cargo vessel less than 20 years old and U.S.-documented. Directs the Secretary, notwithstanding any other law, to allow any qualified U.S. operator to qualify any militarily useful vessels for an ODS if the operator applies within one year of enactment of this Act, meets the requirements for such aid, and meets other requirements. Defines \"qualified operator\" to mean a U.S. citizen who owned, during the two years ending on the date of enactment of this Act, oceangoing vessels documented in the United States. Ends the Secretary's authority to determine suitable ocean routes and lines to foreign ports. Ends the ODS eligibility requirement that vessels be operating in an essential service. Directs the Secretary to designate ocean services, routes, and lines to not be essential services for purposes of ODS. Prohibits the Secretary from designating a route after two years after enactment of this Act unless operation on that route under an ODS is essential for national security. Repeals provisions excluding certain vessels from eligibility for an ODS. Reduces the maximum period for ODS contracts from 20 to ten years. Modifies the formula for determining the amount of ODS payments. Eliminates ODS coverage for insurance, maintenance and repair, and subsistence of officers and crews. Shields contracts in effect on the date of enactment of this Act from the changes until specified events occur. Changes the definition of \"collective bargaining costs.\" Requires wage subsidies to be paid semimonthly rather than monthly. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into or making payments on ODS contracts for a dry cargo or dry bulk vessel that is more than 25 years old or a tanker vessel that is more than 20 years old. (Current law prohibits ODS payments for vessels that are more than 25 years old.) Directs the Secretary, in awarding and revising ODS contracts, to ensure that disruptions to parties to existing contracts are minimized. Provides for a reduction of ODS payments for a particular voyage in proportion to the amount of revenue payable under cargo preference provisions, subject to exception. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out ODS provisions so as to provide incentives for improving the efficiency of operation of vessels for which an ODS is paid.

Requires information obtained through the design and construction of prototypes to be made available to private shipyards and ship suppliers. Title VI: Federal Ship Mortgage Insurance - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to exclude from the definition of \"vessel,\" as used in provisions relating to Federal ship mortgage insurance: (1) any vessel used primarily for offshore exploration or exploitation of petroleum; and (2) barges, tugs, towboats, and workboats. Title VII: Tax Incentives for Modernization of U.S. Shipyards - Amends provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 and the Internal Revenue Code regarding tax incentives and relating to merchant marine capital construction funds to define \"reconstruction\" to include general repairs to a qualified vessel to the extent that their costs exceeds a specified amount. Adds references to shipyards to the same provisions of both Acts. (Current law provides the incentives only for certain vessels and related barges or containers.) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add qualified vessels and qualified shipyards to the list of exceptions to the termination of the regular percentage, for purposes of determining the amount of the investment tax credit. Restores, for such vessels and shipyards, the depreciation schedule which was in effect on the day before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Title VIII: Tariff and Trade Reform for Vessel Construction and Operation - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose, when purchased or performed in a foreign country, an ad valorem duty on: (1) modifications and permanent additions to the hull, fittings, or superstructure of a vessel, including inspections required by the classifications societies, insurers, and governmental entities; and (2) vessel drydocking and all services necessary for drydocking. Excluding emergency repairs from imposition of such duty.

Makes an owner or operator who fails to so spend liable for the duty plus accrued interest. Requires amounts received as a duty to be deposited into the Procure and Charter Revolving Fund established by this Act. Title IX: Expansion of Cargo Reserved for U.S. Vessels - Amends cargo preference provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to require that 100 percent of the agricultural and nonagricultural ocean-borne cargoes generated by the U.S. Government, including cargoes generated as a result of a foreign aid cash transfer program, be transported on privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels, subject to exception. (Current law requires that 50 percent of nonagricultural and 25 percent of certain agricultural commodities be transported on U.S.-flag commercial vessels.) States that, in authorizing a vessel which is not U.S.-registered to transport any cargo which is foreign assistance subject to the provisions being amended, the Secretary of Transportation must require that 50 percent of the cargo be transported on U.S.-registered vessels and the remainder on vessels registered in the country receiving the assistance. Title X: Increasing Defense Readiness of United States Merchant Marine - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to direct the Secretary of Transportation, before approving any assistance under such Act for the construction of a vessel intended for use in the coastwise trade, to submit the plans to the Secretary of Defense for review and approval. Directs the Secretary of Defense to either: (1) certify that the plans are suitable for construction of a vessel which is capable of economical and expeditious conversion to use during war or national defense emergency; or (2) request changes in the plans necessary to enable that conversion. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, subject to appropriations, to pay to a person constructing a vessel in the United States after enactment of this Act to be operated in the coastwise trade, before construction begins, the costs of: (1) constructing any national defense features; (2) maintaining the features for 15 years; (3) additional operating expenses because of the features during that period; and (4) lost revenue during that period because of reduced cargo space. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that: (1) rates paid by the Department of Defense for the carriage of ocean-borne cargoes should fully compensate the vessel owner and could be based on established commercial rates; and (2) contracts for such carriage should be awarded, compatible with sound business practice (including cost minimization), so as to enhance the strategic sealift capabilities of the U.S.-flag commercial merchant fleet. Prohibits the Department of Defense, subject to exception and after enactment of this Act, from entering into any contract for carriage of cargoes on a vessel which was: (1) not U.S.-built; or (2) documented in the United States after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) and the Secretary of Defense to establish a national maritime industries research and development program to carry out commercial water-borne and commercial intermodal transportation and strategic sealift-related research and development. Makes the Secretary responsible for administering the program and lists areas which must be included in the program. Directs the two Secretaries to jointly establish the Maritime Research and Development Advisory Board. Directs the Secretary, as a condition of a research and development project under these provisions, to require that private industry pay a portion of the cost of the project.
