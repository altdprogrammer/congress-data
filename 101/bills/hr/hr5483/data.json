    "text": "Federal Employees Assistance Act of 1990 - Authorizes Federal agencies to: (1) cover a portion of the costs incurred by a non-Government employer to retrain Federal employees who have been separated or who face separation from Government service due to a major reorganization, reduction in force, or transfer of function for placement with such employer; and (2) provide training to prepare such an employee for placement with a non-Government employer. Permits such employees, under regulations prescribed by the President, to waive payments of severance pay and to instead have such payments made to a non-Government employer that employs such individuals on a full-time basis for at least one year. Authorizes Federal agency heads to procure by contract the temporary or intermittent services provided by employment agencies to help find employment for such employees. Authorizes payment to Federal employees who are separated as a result of a major reorganization, reduction in force, or transfer of functions of relocation expense incurred to commence employment with a non-Government employer under certain conditions. Waives certain dual compensation prohibitions under the Civil Service and Federal Employees' Retirement Systems for an annuitant who is employed in a temporary position and whose annuity is based on a separation occurring because of a major reorganization, reduction in force, or transfer of function for the first 24 calendar months of such temporary service, unless the annuitant was employed in a Government position in which the annuitant was subject to such provisions before being placed in the temporary position involved. Limits the amount of pay (excluding premium pay) which any such annuitant may receive when aggregated with the annuity to the rate of basic pay last payable before separation from service."
