    "text": "Combat Merchant Mariners Benefit Act of 1990 - Provides that: (1) service in the U.S. merchant marine during a period of war for a total period equal to at least 12 months shall be considered active duty in determining eligibility for veterans benefits; and (2) such service may be verified by entries in a continuous discharge book, a certificate of discharge to merchant seamen, a certificate of substantially continuous service, or other documentation available from the Secretary of Transportation or the head of any other Federal agency. Limits eligibility to: (1) service on a U.S. vessel on ocean, coastwise, or intercoastal voyages, during a period of war in a combat zone (where such service was rendered to the armed forces in a capacity considered civilian employment or contractual service); (2) any period of forcible detention or internment by an enemy government or hostile force as a result of hostile action against a U.S. vessel while performing such service on the vessel; and (3) any period (up to six months) of service in the War Shipping Administration, the U.S. Maritime Service, or a maritime training program conducted or recognized by the armed forces. Specifies that: (1) the minimum active-duty service requirement of any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs shall apply in determining eligibility for veterans benefits under this Act; (2) the 12-month requirement under this Act shall not apply to an individual who is permanently disabled in the performance of such service while the vessel is subjected to hostile action; and (3) such service may have been rendered before the date of enactment of this Act, but an individual who has performed service before such date shall not be paid veterans benefits that accrue as a result of the enactment of this Act for any period of accrual before such date."
