    "date": "1990-09-27", 
    "text": "Job Training Partnership Act Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to authorize appropriations for FY 1991 and succeeding fiscal years for: (1) title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) part A (Adult and Older Worker Programs); (2) title II part B (Summer Youth Employment and Training Programs); (3) title II part C (Year-Round Youth Services); (4) title IV (Federally Administered Programs) parts C, D, E, F, G, and new H (Veterans' Employment Programs; National Activities; Labor Market Information; National Commission for Employment Policy; Training to Fulfill Affirmative Action Obligations; new Training Institutes); (5) title IV part A (Employment and Training Programs for Native Americans and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers); and (6) title IV new part I (Youth Opportunities Unlimited Program). Reserves specified amounts for the Veterans' Employment Programs, National Commission for Employment Policy, and the new Training Institutes. Defines \"basic skills deficient\" as reading or computing skills at or below 8th grade level. Adds the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, the Center for Employment Training, and organizations serving older workers to the list of community-based organizations. Revises the definition of \"economically disadvantaged\" to: (1) refer to income guidelines promulgated each year by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) include those determined eligible for, even if not receiving, food stamps; and (3) include migrant or seasonal farmworkers who meet income level requirements or whose income level during any consecutive 12-month period during the 24 months prior to application meets such requirements. Revises the definition of \"supportive services\" to include drug and alcohol abuse counseling and referral and individual and family counseling. Includes representatives of local welfare agencies and organizations representing older workers on private industry councils (PICs). Revises requirements for performance standards to: (1) promote delivery of services to the hard-to-serve; and (2) add measurement of increased basic education attainment and occupational skills (as well as the current measurement of increased employment and earnings and reduced welfare dependency). Provides for the following additional factors in performance standards for youth programs: (1) attainment of education and employability competencies; (2) secondary and postsecondary school completion or its equivalent; and (3) enrollment in other education, training, or employment programs or apprenticeships, or enlistment in the Armed Forces. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to report biennially to the Congress on JTPA performance standards. Adds older workers to the special populations for which variations in performance standards must be prescribed. Allows modifications of such special population standards not more than once every two years, with reported reasons. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the authority of State Governors to prescribe variations in performance standards within certain parameters. Requires State Governors to: (1) provide technical assistance to any service delivery area (SDA) which fails to meet performance standards for a program year; (2) assume administrative responsibilities for such SDA if failure persists for two consecutive years; and (3) incorporate the SDA into another contiguous SDA if such alternative arrangements do not result in improved performance within 12 months. Directs the Secretary to enforce such incorporation if the Governor fails to take such corrective actions. Directs the Secretary to establish a universal definition of placement for use in development of performance standards. Requires SDAs, in selecting service providers, to consider provision of support services, including child care. Revises limitations on certain costs for specified programs, including general administrative costs, combined administration and support services costs, and training-related services costs. Prohibits duplication of supportive services which are available free to participants through other services. Prohibits Governors from disapproving any local job training plan or modification on the basis of costs if these are in compliance with these specified limitations. Revises provisions for additional State responsibilities under title I (Job Training Partnership) of the JTPA. Allows the Governor's coordination and special services plan to describe the State's criteria for acceptable verification and documentation of participant eligibility, which, if approved by the Secretary, shall be deemed to meet specified requirements. Requires Governors, in providing certain staff training, to take into account training available through the National Training Institute. Authorizes Governors to adopt certain professional training curricula and administrative competency standards. Includes State agencies primarily responsible for administration of programs for older workers among those which may be represented on the State Job Coordinating Council. Requires State labor market information programs to include training and technical assistance to support comprehensive career guidance and participant outcome activities for local programs assisted under JTPA. Requires identification of any State-imposed or interpreted rule, regulation, policy, or performance standard relating to administration and operation of programs funded by JTPA. Revises program requirements for service delivery systems. Exempts normal tuition charges for training or education from certain requirements for a breakdown of cost components. Allows an SDA which is a city or a county to serve residents of either the city or the county if the city is located within the county and is a separate SDA. Limits the duration of on-the-job training to a period not in excess of that generally required for acquisition of skills needed for that position, but never exceeding six months. Requires on-the-job contracts to: (1) specify types and duration of training and other services; and (2) if an intermediary brokering contractor is used for placements, specify certain additional services and factors. Extends specified minimum wage exemptions to certain SDAs. Revises certain Federal and fiscal administrative provisions. Allows the use of certain advance payment methods when contracting with nonprofit organizations of demonstrated effectiveness. Directs the administrative law judge to reduce or cancel a determination of unallowable expenditures to the extent that specified mitigating circumstances warrant. Requires all entities receiving JTPA funds to follow directives of the applicable Office of Management and Budget Circulars and/or the Common Rules for administrative and cost principles. Requires SDAs to retain and use interest income in a specified manner. Prohibits use of JTPA funds for fees or profits to governmental units, grantees, or subgrantees, but allows such use for reasonable fees or profits to private for profit entities and cost-type administrative service contractors. Requires Governors to report semiannually to the Secretary on the amount of expenditures by each SDA for each fiscal year under title II of JTPA. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to permit grantees to use current funds for costs of audit resolutions of prior grants. Revises conditions under which the Governor may take corrective action against an SDA for noncompliance with fiscal requirements. Directs the Secretary to take such corrective action if the Governor fails to do so. Revises reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Requires recipients to maintain and provide to the Secretary standardized records of a sufficient number of individual participants to provide an adequate sample size to allow for preparation of national estimates to meet specified requirements. Requires State, administrative entity, and grant recipient reports prescribed by the Secretary to be made annually. Requires such reports to include specified types of information. Requires each recipient, subrecipient, and service provider to maintain records of revenues and expenditures for at least three years following grant period expiration. Revises title II of JTPA (Training Services for the Disadvantaged). Separates the current title II part A (Adult and Youth Programs) into part A (Adult and Older Worker Programs) and part C (Year-Round Youth Services), while retaining the same name for part B (Summer Youth Employment and Training Programs). Sets forth part A (Adult and Older Worker Programs). Revises allotment provisions to establish State set-asides for education, performance incentives, and auditing and administration. Allows individuals, whether employed or unemployed, to be eligible for part A services as long as they are adults (age 22 or older) who are economically disadvantaged. Requires that at least 50 percent of part A program participants in each SDA be individuals who, in addition to being economically disadvantaged adults, are in one or more of the following categories: (1) basic skills deficient; (2) school dropouts; (3) recipients of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) who either meet specified requirements or have an employability plan under the Social Security Act; or (4) unemployed for the previous six months or longer. (Retains the current provision that allows up to ten percent of program participants in an SDA not to be economically disadvantaged if they have encountered barriers to employment.) Requires SDAs to: (1) make special efforts and expenditures to serve older workers; (2) coordinate delivery of such services with those under the Older Americans Act; and (3) give priority to service providers with demonstrated effectiveness in providing such services. Requires SDAs and State job training coordinating councils to encourage job training service providers to provide child care services at minimal cost to participants. Establishes part A program design requirements, including: (1) assessment of participants' skill levels and service needs; (2) development of service strategies to identify employment goals, appropriate achievement objectives, and appropriate services; (3) review of participant progress; and (4) if appropriate, basic (including language) and occupational skills training. Requires that job search, job search skills training, job club, and work experience be accompanied by other services designed to increase a participant's basic education or occupational skills. Allows an exception from such combination requirement only if: (1) the participant's assessment and service strategy indicate that the additional services are not appropriate; and (2) the activities are not available to the participant through the Employment Service or other public agencies. Allows continued provision of counseling and supportive services to a participant for up to one year after termination from the program. Revises authorized services for which part A program funds may be used. Eliminates employment-generating activities from the list of such authorized services. Divides the lists of such services into direct training, training-related, and participant support services. Revises title II part B (Summer Youth Employment and Training Programs) to limit administrative costs to 15 percent (or 20 percent for grant recipients of $200,000 or less).
