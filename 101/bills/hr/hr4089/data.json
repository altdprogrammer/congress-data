    "text": "Veterans Educational and Vocational Counseling Amendments of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide educational and vocational counseling and related services to: (1) individuals eligible for educational assistance under the armed forces educational assistance program; (2) individuals discharged or released from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable within the past year; and (3) individuals serving on active duty and within 180 days from being released or discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Requires the Secretary to make available information concerning the need for general education and for trained personnel in the various crafts, trades, and professions. Requires the Secretary to acquaint all eligible individuals with the availability of counseling services offered under this Act. Provides entitlement for a veterans' rehabilitation program for persons receiving outpatient medical care or treatment for a service-connected disability pending discharge from active military service when the Secretary has determined that the hospital providing such care or treatment is under contract with or under the jurisdiction of the Secretary or the Secretary of the military department concerned. Includes the payment of handling fees by the Secretary as part of the scope and services authorized to be provided to a veterans' rehabilitation program. Authorizes the payment of a subsistence allowance to veterans pursuing a vocational rehabilitation program in a Federal, State, or local governmental agency. (Currently, such allowance is offered only to veterans pursuing a program at the Federal level.) Repeals certain reporting requirements concerning post-Vietnam era veterans' educational assistance and education loan defaults. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend, terminate, reduce, or make a final denial of any financial assistance or payment under either a veterans' or an armed forces' educational assistance program or take other adverse action based on information produced by a matching program with the Department of Defense. Requires the Secretary, before taking any such action, to provide the individual involved with written notice of the findings of the Secretary based on the matching program and of the individual's right to contest the findings within ten days.
