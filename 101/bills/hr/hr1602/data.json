Amends provisions relating to grants to States or schools of medicine for demonstration projects for the expansion and improvement of emergency medical services for children to remove the: (1) limitation on the number of grants; and (2) references to the projects being \"in such States.\" Authorizes appropriations.

Requires: (1) matching non-Federal funds; (2) that the facility constructed or modernized be made available to all persons residing or employed in the area; and (3) that a reasonable volume of services be made available to persons unable to pay for the services. Provides for recovery of expenditures for the construction or modernization under the same circumstances as set forth in existing provisions relating to health resources development.
