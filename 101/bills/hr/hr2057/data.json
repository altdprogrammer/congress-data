Prohibits the trustee in bankruptcy from avoiding any transfer made under a swap agreement before commencement of the bankruptcy case or any setoff in connection with a swap agreement if the offset is made within 90 days prior to the bankruptcy filing. Provides that the contractual right of a nonbankrupt party to a swap agreement to terminate the agreement shall not be stayed or otherwise limited under Federal bankruptcy law or by related judicial or administrative proceedings."
