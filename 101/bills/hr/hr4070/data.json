    "text": "Universal Health Benefits Empowerment and Partnership Act of 1990 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for universal coverage under group health plans and State health benefits systems. Requires employers to offer coverage for eligible individuals under basic group health plans or group health payroll deduction plans. Sets forth requirements for State health benefit systems, including reporting, participation, benefits, and contribution requirements. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prescribe regulations for State systems. Provides for State health benefits system coverage for uninsurable risks and preexisting conditions. Provides for certain basic health benefits systems as alternatives to State health benefits systems. Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a program of grants to State health benefits systems and alternative basic health benefits systems in order to facilitate the effectuation of universal coverage. Authorizes appropriations. Preempts State laws which mandate certain health benefits or restrict managed medical care under employee welfare benefit plans. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to remove certain restrictions on the tax-exempt status of multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs) providing basic health benefits. Establishes certain annual reporting requirements for such MEWAs. Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to revise provisions for the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (the Agency) and the Office of the Forum for Quality and Effectiveness in Health Care. Requires the Federal Advisory Council on Health Care Coverage and Costs (established by this Act) to: (1) study how practice guidelines may be used in reducing medical malpractice costs; and (2) report results and recommendations to the Secretary of HHS. Authorizes appropriations under the PHSA. Establishes a Federal Advisory Council on Health Care Coverage and Costs. Directs the Council to report at least annually to the Secretaries of HHS and of Labor, until the Secretary of HHS requests a final report. Terminates the Council upon submission of its final report. Amends the IRC to increase the deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals from 25 percent to 100 percent. Repeals a termination provision, thus making such deduction permanent for plans established by the self-employed for themselves and their employees."
