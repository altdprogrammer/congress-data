Sets forth an authorized prospecting period during which prospecting and locating a mining claim may be conducted with minimal surface disruption (but precludes road construction or the use of explosives or mechanical earth moving equipment on such lands). Limits the total acreage that may be covered at any time by notices of intention to locate a claim. Prohibits any mineral exploration or development activities without the surface owner's consent unless the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) has authorized such activities according to prescribed guidelines which include posting a surety bond to insure: (1) surface reclamation; (2) compensation paid to the surface owner for damages to crops and tangible improvements; and (3) compensation for loss of income by the surface owner due to impaired land use. Sets forth conditions under which plans of operation for mineral development and exploration may be pursued (including minimization of impaired land use and the payment of a fee to the surface owner for the use of surface lands). Requires the Secretary to suspend or revoke the approval of a mining or prospecting plan of operations if the mine operator fails to remedy any plan violations. Sets forth conditions under which treble damages may be awarded to an aggrieved surface owner. Authorizes the Secretary to convey Federal interests in Stock Raising Homestead Act lands to the surface owner without regard to certain requirements of the Federal Land Management Policy Management Act of 1976. Requires the Secretary to simplify the procedures governing applications by surface owners of Stock Raising Homestead Act lands to obtain title to the Federal interests in those lands."
