Requires air carriers who cancel a flight: (1) in violation of this Act to compensate passengers; and (2) for safety-related reasons to notify passengers of such cancellations. Requires air carriers to notify their passengers of any delays of 15 minutes or more in the departure or arrival of scheduled flights. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a toll-free telephone number system: (1) for receiving passenger complaints relating to air service; and (2) to provide passengers with information relating to comparative air carrier service, including data on flight delays, mishandled baggage, oversales, and consumer complaints. Requires air carriers to establish such system for handling passenger service complaints. Sets forth requirements relating to: (1) advertisement of fares; (2) ticket information; (3) frequent flyer programs; (4) lost or damaged baggage claims; and (5) cost of meals. Sets forth civil penalties for economic cancellations by air carriers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to the Department of Transportation for administrative expenses incurred in implementing the provisions of this Act. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to make permanent the prohibition against smoking on scheduled airline flights."
