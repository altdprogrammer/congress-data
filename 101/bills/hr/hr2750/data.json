    "text": "Congressional Campaign Fairness Act of 1989 - Declares that candidates seeking election to the Congress should: (1) limit contributions from political committees to no more than 40 percent of total campaign contributions accepted; and (2) require that at least 75 percent of their campaign contributions be from residents of their State. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a multicandidate political committee from making contributions from November 15 following the date of a regularly scheduled general election until the following November 14 to any individual elected as a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives at that election or to the authorized political committees of such individual. Reduces from $5,000 to $2,500 the aggregate amount a multicandidate political committee may contribute to a candidate or his authorized political committee in any election for Federal office. Permits the national committee of a political party or a State committee of a political party to contribute to a candidate for the office of Senator or Member of the House of Representatives or the authorized committee of such candidate an amount equal to the total amount of contributions of less than $200 each that is received by such candidate or authorized committee. Repeals the exception which permits any individual who was a Member of Congress on January 8, 1980, to convert excess campaign funds to personal use. Requires disclosure of the name of a political committee in any political communication if such committee makes independent expenditures for the purpose of financing such communications."
