(Currently, only the former statement is required.) Requires the head of a defense agency to make an award based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation. Authorizes the head of a defense agency to evaluate competitive proposals and award a contract either with or without discussions with the offerors, depending on the statement included in the solicitation."
