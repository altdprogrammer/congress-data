    "text": "Restitution Enhancement and Personal Accountability Act of 1990 - Title I: Expansion and Improvement in Administration of Restitution Orders - Amends the Federal criminal code to order criminal defendants to pay, as part of appropriate restitution expenses, prosecution and incarceration expenses as well as the cost of services provided to defendants as part of a drug or alcohol rehabilitation or job training or life skills program. Gives the sentencing court discretion to consider the financial needs of the defendant's dependents in the issuance of an order of restitution. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules and regulations for procedures to ensure that crime victims: (1) receive maximum appropriate restitution for injury or loss sustained as the result of a criminal act; and (2) receive proper and full notice as to the filing of charges against a suspected offender and the right to be heard by the sentencing court before the acceptance of a plea agreement disposing of the case. Requires the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and such other departments and agencies as designated by the Attorney General to incorporate into training programs for officers and employees assistance in the performance of their duties in connection with restitution. Requires the heads of such agencies to report to the Director of the Office of Victims Assistance of DOJ on agency success in identifying and notifying crime victims, including any officer and employee training and incentives program. Title II: Incentive Grants for Establishment of Restitution Centers - Requires DOJ to make grants to States for the establishment of programs for the placement of nonviolent offenders in restitution centers, which would: (1) provide such offenders the opportunity to earn adequate resources to compensate their crime victims; and (2) place such offenders in an environment conducive to their rehabilitation. Authorizes a State correctional agency or department to apply for such a grant to establish or expand a restitution center. Outlines grant application requirements. Allows States to use surplus Federal lands and facilities as sites for the restitution centers. Authorizes appropriations for such grants."
