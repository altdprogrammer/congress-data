    "text": "Seagoing Anti-Discriminatory Treatment Act - Amends Federal law to prohibit a member of the Coast Guard from engaging in hazing. Provides for enforcement. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to prohibit an individual involved in maritime education or training from engaging in hazing. Defines \"individual involved in maritime education and training\" to mean individuals associated with the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy or with a State or regional maritime academy or training institution receiving Federal cooperation or assistance under provisions of such Act relating to maritime education and training. Provides for enforcement, including requiring the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, if the Secretary finds that a violation has occurred, to withdraw all assistance and cooperation under such provisions unless the individuals engaged in hazing are permanently separated from the institution. Amends Federal law to remove references to the merchant marine from a list of exemptions to provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. Amends provisions of Federal law relating to protection and relief of merchant seamen to require an individual in charge of a U.S. vessel engaged in commerce to report to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating a complaint of a sexual offense prohibited under provisions of Federal criminal law relating to sexual abuse. Amends Federal law relating to vessels and seamen to prohibit a seaman from engaging in hazing onboard a U.S. vessel. Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to make it unlawful to assault or interfere with an observer on a vessel under the Act. Adds such actions to provisions listing criminal offenses and their punishments."
