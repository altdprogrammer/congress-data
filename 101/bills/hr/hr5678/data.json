Requires the Secretary to give priority to negotiating with a country if the number of individuals who are nationals of such country represent a large percentage of individuals meeting such criteria. Permits such agreements to provide for the contribution of U.S. funds to a country for the construction of prison facilities for individuals transferred from the United States or for other expenses incurred in imprisoning such individuals. Authorizes appropriations."
