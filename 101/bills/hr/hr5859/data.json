    "text": "Chance to Go to College Act - Establishes a demonstration program to provide early intervention support and additional financial assistance to graduating students from selected high schools who wish to attend a postsecondary institution. Directs the Secretary of Education to select 50 high schools to participate in such program. Requires that: (1) the selected schools represent a broad base of both urban and rural sites; and (2) special consideration be given to schools demonstrating the support of private individuals or corporations or current involvement with Upward Bound or other TRIO programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). Requires eligible schools to be located in a school district for which the number of children counted for special assistance for disadvantaged children exceeds 75 percent of the total number of children in such district. Requires that such schools also demonstrate each of the following characteristics: (1) potential for parental involvement; (2) academic component with both tutoring and supplemental instruction; (3) role model relationships or other support group interactions; (4) guidance for selection of college preparatory courses before the start of ninth grade; and (5) assistance with the college application processes. Directs the Secretary to provide the selected high schools with assistance to offset administrative costs of program participation. Bases an individual student's eligibility for a scholarship under such program upon his or her: (1) having been a ninth grade student during academic year 1992-1993 in a selected school; (2) being enrolled or accepted for enrollment at an institution of higher education; and (3) qualifying for a Pell Grant under HEA to attend such institution. Sets the maximum amount of such an individual scholarship at: (1) a total of $25,000 for four academic years; and (2) not more than the cost of attendance, on a yearly basis. States that such scholarship amount shall not be reduced for receipt of other forms of Federal financial assistance, but that such other financial aid shall be appropriately reduced if the total of this scholarship and that other aid exceeds the cost of attendance for an academic year. Provides for equitable reduction of scholarships in case of insufficient funds. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study to: (1) determine what type of schools have benefitted from the demonstration program; and (2) evaluate the program's impact on graduation and matriculation of students from the selected high schools. Directs the Comptroller General, if such study demonstrates significant results, to determine what authorization increases and adjustments, if any, should be made to the Pell Grants, TRIO, and other specified programs to replicate these results nationwide. Authorizes appropriations."
