    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-06-14", 
    "text": "Violent Crime and Drug Control Act of 1990 - Title I: Effective Rehabilitation - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require States to develop and submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services annually for review and approval a Statewide Drug Treatment Plan.Requires States to maintain expenditures for drug abuse-related services at a level equal to not less than the average amount of such expenditures for the preceding two years, unless the Secretary determines that extraordinary conditions in the State (currently, limited to economic conditions) justify the waiver. Directs the Secretary to promulgate implementing regulations, including the procedures by which a full or partial waiver may be granted.Requires the Secretary of Education to: (1) develop a model curriculum regarding treatment for individuals who are addicted to drugs; and (2) disseminate such curriculum to medical schools. Authorizes appropriations.Bars the Secretary of Health and Human Services from making certain payments under the Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services Block Grant program unless the State: (1) makes specified progress toward setting up a referral system through which individuals seeking drug abuse treatment can be informed of appropriate facilities in the State for obtaining such treatment; and (2) agrees to establish procedures to ensure that newborn infants of drug or alcohol abusing mothers are tested and evaluated for exposure to illegal drugs, to waive civil and criminal liability against qualified health care professionals conducting such test and evaluation in compliance with State-established procedures, and, if the newborn has been exposed to illegal drugs, to ensure that the necessary health care services are immediately made available to the mother and infant.Extends to the Coast Guard coverage under the law providing for identification, treatment, and rehabilitation of members of the armed forces who are dependent on drugs or alcohol.Title II: User Accountability and Drug Paraphernalia Restrictions - Subtitle A: User Accountability - Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to remove discretion from the courts and thus make mandatory the denial of Federal benefits for a fixed term after a conviction for distribution or possession of a controlled substance.Requires the Office of Management and Budget (currently, the President) to report to the Congress by January 1, 1991 (currently, May 1, 1989) with regard to the withholding of Federal benefits, including a listing of each such benefit for which drug traffickers and possessors will be ineligible.Specifies that the \"approved\" drug treatment program which an individual convicted of a controlled substance possession offense must successfully complete must be a program chosen by the court.Restricts the allocation and distribution of funds under the Drug Control and System Improvement Grant program to States: (1) that do not have in effect, and which do not enforce, laws requiring the mandatory revocation of the driver's license for at least one year for specified drug offenses and a mandatory denial of requests by such individuals for the issuance or reinstatement of such license; and (2) in which the State legislature has not voted to exempt the State from the operation of such provisions. Allows such State laws, without risking loss of Federal funds under this Act, to provide that the license of a first, but not a subsequent, offender, be reinstated upon performance of three months community service by such offender who passes periodic drug tests during such service.Prohibits the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating from issuing a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document unless the applicant makes available to the Secretary information contained in the National Driver Register regarding the applicant's driving record. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review the criminal record of such an applicant; and (2) establish a testing program for use of a dangerous drug in violation of law for such applicant for issuance or renewal of a license or certificate of registry.Limits the duration of certificates of registry to five years, subject to renewal for additional five-year periods (currently, unlimited).Makes mariners' documents valid for five years, subject to renewal for additional five-year periods. Requires the Secretary to review the criminal record of applicants for renewal of mariners' documents, licenses, and certificates of registry.Sets forth provisions with respect to termination of existing certificates of registry and merchant mariners' documents.Requires the Secretary to: (1) request a holder of a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document to make available to the Secretary all information contained in the National Driver Register regarding the motor vehicle driving record of such individual; (2) establish a program for testing the holder of such a license for use of alcohol and dangerous drugs in violation of law; (3) temporarily suspend (subject to a hearing within 15 days) and take possession of the license held by an individual who performs a safety sensitive function on a vessel and where there is probable cause to believe that the individual has performed such function in violation of law, has been convicted of an offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of the license, or has been convicted within the five-year period of an offense under the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (NDRA).Defines \"dangerous drug\" to mean a narcotic, controlled substance, or marijuana.Includes among the bases for license suspension or revocation conviction of an offense: (1) that would prevent the issuance or renewal of a license; or (2) under the NDRA within the five-year period preceding the suspension or revocation.Authorizes the termination of a license revocation only after: (1) the Secretary decides that the issuance is compatible with good discipline and safety at sea; and (2) the former holder provides satisfactory proof that the bases for revocation are no longer valid.Sets forth procedures for the removal of a master or individual in charge of a vessel reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcohol or dangerous drugs.Amends the NDRA to: (1) authorize an individual who holds or who has applied for a license to request the chief driver licensing official of a State to transmit to the Secretary information regarding the motor vehicle driving record of the individual; and (2) require the Secretary to make the information available to the individual for review and written comment before denying, suspending, or revoking such license and to keep such information confidential, with exceptions.Bars the transmission of motor vehicle driving record information which was entered in the register more than five years before the date of the request, unless such information relates to revocations or suspensions that are still in effect on the date of the request.Applies penalties for the negligent operation of a vessel while \"intoxicated\" to negligent operation while \"under the influence of alcohol, or a dangerous drug.\"Subtitle B: Drug Paraphernalia Restrictions - Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 to provide that criminal forfeiture of drug paraphernalia will be accomplished in accordance with procedures applicable to other criminal forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action and to seek injunctive relief and authorizes the court to assess a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for violations of the paraphernalia statute.Provides for civil forfeiture of drug paraphernalia, other property involved, and property traceable to property involved in a violation of criminal forfeiture provisions.Title III: Interdiction Improvements - Makes it unlawful for the pilot, operator, or person in charge of any aircraft which has crossed the U.S. border or is subject to U.S. jurisdiction operating outside the United States to refuse to obey the order of an authorized Federal law enforcement officer to land in cases involving enforcement of controlled substances or money laundering laws. Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to vessels. Establishes penalties for violation of such provisions. Specifies that any vessel or aircraft used in such a violation may be seized and forfeited.Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require: (1) revocation of the registration certificate of an aircraft that refuses to land when ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer; and (2) the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to establish procedures for the owner of the aircraft to show cause why the factual predicate did not exist to trigger the revocation of the registration or why it would be in the public interest to issue a new certificate of registration to be effective concurrent with the revocation which occurred by operation of law.Authorizes the Coast Guard to issue orders and make inquiries, searches, seizures, and arrests with respect to violations of U.S. laws occurring aboard any aircraft over the high seas and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. Specifies the method by which orders to land an aircraft must be communicated.Establishes a civil penalty for failure to comply with a lawful boarding or order to land.Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to: (1) authorize U.S. Customs officers to exercise their enforcement authority outside of the United States, including any location in which Customs officers are permitted to conduct inspections, examinations, or searches; and (2) provide civil penalties for failure of an aircraft to comply with customs officer orders to land or bring to and Tariff Act provisions regarding the boarding of vessels.Title IV: International Narcotics Control - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) to: (1) authorize the President to provide narcotics-related assistance to Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru; and (2) make funds available under such Act and the Arms Export Control Act for training and equipment for law enforcement agencies or other units in such countries organized for the specific purpose of narcotics enforcement.Waives during FY 1991 provisions of the FAA and similar provisions relating to limitations on assistance to countries in default on obligations owed to the United States with respect to narcotics-related assistance for a country which is a major illicit drug-producing country because of its coca production.Authorizes the President to provide assistance under the FAA to promote the production, processing, and marketing of products which can be produced economically in such countries in order to reduce dependence upon the production of crops from which narcotic and psychotropic drugs are derived.Revises certain narcotics-related provisions of the FAA to: (1) authorize the use of funds for international narcotics control for defensive arming of U.S.-title aircraft used in narcotics control eradication or interdiction efforts and for personnel and agents participating in such efforts; and (2) make an exception to the provision requiring the President to withhold 50 percent of the assistance authorized and appropriated for a major drug-producing or drug-transit country pending the March 1 certification of narcotics cooperation if he determines that application of such provision would be contrary to the national interest. Repeals provisions requiring that any aircraft made available to a foreign country be provided only on a lease or loan basis.Permits the assigning of more than six members of the armed forces to Military Assistance Groups in Bolivia and Peru.Continues for FY 1991 the waiver of the requirement under the FAA to withhold 50 percent of annual foreign aid to major drug-transit countries which meet specified requirements, such as cooperation with the United States in achieving anti-narcotics objectives.Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Secretary of State to order the surrender to a foreign country of a U.S. citizen whose extradition has been requested by such country even if the terms of the applicable treaty or convention do not obligate the United States to extradite its citizens.Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to extend the Export-Import Bank's authority to finance sales of defense articles and services for anti-narcotics purposes to September 30, 1992 (currently, expires September 30, 1990).Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) practices of foreign governments that condone or permit illicit narcotics production and export are considered damaging to future trade relations with the United States; and (2) the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative should bring the matter of illicit narcotics production and export to the attention of appropriate countries, require foreign countries that tolerate such activities to address their elimination in a serious and effective manner, and consider rewarding foreign countries that make significant strides against drug trafficking with good trade relations with the United States.Title V: Firearms and Related Amendments - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of firearms to non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides.Provides for the disposition of forfeited firearms.Classifies as serious drug offenses for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 serious drug offenses committed by juveniles.Specifies that if a conviction was for a violent felony involving the threatened or actual use of a firearm or explosives, or was for a serious drug offense, such person shall be considered convicted for purposes of this Act irrespective of any pardon, setting aside, expunction, or restoration of civil rights.Permits the judicial officer to consider pretrial detention with respect to certain firearms and explosives offenses.Provides for enhanced penalties for: (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses. Makes enhanced penalties inapplicable in the presence of specified mitigating circumstances, unless the defendant engaged or participated in criminal conduct that gave rise to the occasion for the defendant's use of the firearm.Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives.Bars the sale or possession of firearms and explosives to or by persons convicted of violent or serious misdemeanor drug or narcotic offenses.Provides for the mandatory revocation of the supervised release of an individual for possession of a firearm.Increases penalties for: (1) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (2) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a Federal felony.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) change from six to five years the statute of limitations for certain firearms offenses; and (2) provide for the summary forfeiture of unregistered National Firearms Act weapons, with provision for reimbursement for innocent owners.Makes it unlawful for felons and others to possess explosives.Authorizes the summary destruction of explosives subject to forfeiture under specified circumstances. Sets forth requirements for reimbursement of the value of destroyed property.Title VI: Death Penalty - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes.Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely.Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death.Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.Sets forth special aggravating factors for: (1) espionage, treason, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances.) Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding of at least one aggravating and no mitigating factor, or one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors.States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death.Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence.Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination.Sets forth procedures for the implementation of the sentence of death.Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death.Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) \"murder for hire;\" (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; (9) specified violations of the CSA, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act; and (10) genocide.Increases the minimum sentence to life imprisonment for the crime of bank robbery which results in death.Provides for appointment of counsel in Federal cases where a defendant is charged with a crime with respect to which a sentence of death is sought and is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Sets forth additional provisions with respect to: (1) representation before and after review of judgment; (2) standards for competence of counsel; and (3) claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. Authorizes, in the discretion of the court, appointment of counsel for a petitioner who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel in Federal habeas corpus proceedings involving State prisoners in capital cases.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgments imposing a sentence of death; and (2) stays of execution.Title VII: Criminal Justice System Reform - Subtitle A: Habeas Corpus Proceedings Relating to Death Penalty Cases - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence. Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes.
