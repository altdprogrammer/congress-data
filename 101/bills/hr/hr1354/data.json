Requires the FTC to include provisions in such rules for refunds for untimely delivery of goods or services, order cancellations, time restrictions in connection with unsolicited sales calls, and recordkeeping requirements. Declares that rule violators shall be considered to have engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Prohibits telemarketing conduct whose natural consequence is to harass, oppress, or abuse and considers violators to have engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Authorizes both citizen suits (amount in controversy must exceed $50,000) and civil actions on behalf of a State for relief against entities engaging in telemarketing fraud or dishonest acts or practices. Prescribes the general framework to govern such suits. Directs the FTC to establish a clearinghouse for inquiries made to Federal agencies concerning telemarketing."
