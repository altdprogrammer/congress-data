Sets forth a formula for determining authorized appropriations for subsequent fiscal years. Title II: Congressional Authority - Waives the period of congressional review required before District of Columbia Acts take effect. Revises the authority of the Congress to enact legislation that amends or repeals such Acts. Repeals certain rules governing congressional consideration of District of Columbia Council actions. Title III: Budget Autonomy - District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act - Makes budget provisions that are disapproved by the Mayor, but reenacted by two-thirds of the Council or not resubmitted to the Council in a timely manner, part of the budget Act without their transmittal to the President. Eliminates the requirements that an Act of Congress: (1) approve the District of Columbia budget and supplements thereto before amounts are obligated or expended under such budget or its supplements; and (2) authorize District of Columbia employment positions before such positions are filled."
