    "text": "Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1990 - Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for FY 1991 through 1993 for specified environmental research, development, and demonstration activities and for program management and support of the Office of Research and Development. Authorizes the transfer of funds among categories, but requires prior notice to the Congress of transfers exceeding ten percent from or to any category. Prohibits the Administrator from using any funds appropriated in this Act for office closings or reductions in force unless a congressional notice and wait procedure has been complied with by the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to establish a separately identified core research program consisting of fundamental ecological, health, and risk reduction research to support efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate serious environmental risks. Directs the Administrator to establish a Research Strategy Council to oversee, review, and ensure adequate funding of the core research program. Requires the Science Advisory Board to review and make recommendations on core research program activities. Directs the Administrator to establish an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program to conduct comprehensive, long-term environmental monitoring, data collection, and data analysis to assess and respond to the current and long-term status and trends of the ecological resources of the United States. Requires the Administrator to coordinate Program activities with other Federal agencies and to make available to the public and the Congress statistical data summaries and interpretive reports on ecological status and trends developed as a result of the Program. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a modernization program to identify, acquire, and maintain modern buildings, facilities, supplies, and equipment needed to conduct high quality research; and (2) conduct studies and make assessments of the adequacy of the equipment and facilities to meet the needs of EPA and to attract well-qualified scientists, engineers, and other appropriate personnel. Repeals a required annual report from the Administrator of a five-year plan for environmental research, development, and demonstration. Requires the Science Advisory Board to submit annual reports to the Congress and the Administrator on the proposed research program described in the President's budget request for research, development, and demonstration activities of the EPA. Requires the Board to conduct periodic evaluations of selected areas of the current and planned activities. Requires concurrent submission to the Congress of any report required from the Board to the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to carry out a program of research and monitoring on regional, national, and global impacts of environmental pollution and perturbation on biological diversity. Requires the Administrator to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to develop recommendations on establishing a National Environmental Research Institute which would support long-range fundamental and environmental research, including competitive grants to interdisciplinary research teams and individual investigators. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) lease facilities, buildings, and other property to promote the activities authorized under this Act; and (2) enter into cooperative agreements to conduct application reviews and use research funds for such cooperative agreements. Directs the Administrator to: (1) report annually to the Congress on the accomplishments of programs authorized under this Act as they related to EPA's mission to reduce or prevent environmental risk; (2) conduct a study of, and submit a report concerning, the environmental implications and potential consequences of growth and development of communities; (3) produce a decision aid to assist State and local authorities in planning and managing such growth; (4) develop and implement a research program to increase understanding of the adverse human health effects of exposure to electric and magnetic fields; and (5) established in conjunction with such program a public information dissemination and technical assistance program related to such health effects."
