Prohibits interstate telecommunications carriers from carrying audiotext services that fail to include: (1) specified disclosure messages describing the service, cost, and option to hang up; (2) a requirement that any bypass mechanism allowing frequent callers to avoid listening to the disclosure message be disabled after any significant price change; (3) equipment that stops the assessment of charges upon disconnection, automatically disconnects after one cycle of the program, and automatically disconnects interactive programs if no activity occurs within a specified time period; and (4) arrangements with local exchange carriers to prohibit disconnection of telephone service because of nonpayment of audiotext charges. Requires such carriers to: (1) grant callers the option to avoid audiotext charges caused by unauthorized use or misunderstanding of the charges applied; (2) offer callers the option of blocking access to audiotext services; (3) include a signal alerting callers to the passage of time; (4) establish a toll-free telephone number to answer questions and provide information on callers' rights and obligations with respect to such services; (5) include a specified disclosure statement to telephone subscribers; and (6) notify the appropriate State regulatory commission of the intent to provide audiotext services in the State and make available all audiotext access numbers. Sets forth requirements concerning advertising for audiotext services."
