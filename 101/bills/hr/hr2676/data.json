    "text": "Solid Waste Prevention Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish within the Office of Research and Development a program to support the development of technologies and other means of assisting State and local governments in preventing solid wastes. Requires the Administrator, through grants, contracts, or other means, to emphasize research into: (1) developing improved solid waste prevention and recycling technologies and methods; (2) determining types of materials and packaging that could be recycled more easily; and (3) identifying markets for recycled materials. Directs: (1) the Administrator to establish a program of research grants to State and local governments that have solid waste prevention and recycling programs to enable such governments to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and determine ways in which they could be improved; and (2) each State or local government receiving such a grant to report to the Administrator on the results of such research. Specifies that such grants, in combination with any other Federal funds, shall not exceed 50 percent of the costs of any project assisted under this Act. Requires the Administrator to: (1) disseminate to the public and private sectors information obtained from solid waste prevention research or State evaluation research grants; (2) provide technical assistance to State and local governments; and (3) submit to the Congress, by January 1, 1991, and annually thereafter, a report describing program accomplishments, identifying and ranking technical or other management actions that could be taken by State and local governments according to their cost and effectiveness in preventing solid wastes, and outlining future research needs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994."
