Requires the Secretary of the Interior to guarantee for purchase by the Federal Financing Bank bonds or other obligations of the Government Development Bank of the Virgin Islands issued to provide for economic or social development or recovery from damage caused by Hugo. Authorizes the Federal Financing Bank to purchase, receive, or otherwise acquire such bonds and obligations. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior for technical assistance to the Virgin Islands, including funds for the development and maintenance of infrastructure and for economic development."
