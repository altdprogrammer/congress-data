    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-09-13", 
    "text": "Workforce 2000 Job Training Partnership Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (the Act) to include the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs as an example of the community-based organizations which may provide services under the Act. Provides that, for those participants who not acquire employment until three months after their termination from the program, the service providers shall not receive credit for a positive termination unless such employment is related to the training provided or is the result of direct placement assistance made available by the service provider. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) and State Governors, in prescribing variations in performance standards for youth, to provide incentives for programs that refer youth from the Training Services for the Disadvantaged (TSD) program to Job Corps programs, and vice versa, or that coordinate these two programs. Directs the State Job Training Coordinating Council (State council) and service delivery areas (SDAs) to coordinate delivery of disadvantaged training services to youth with delivery of Job Corps services. Provides that, for all governmental and nonprofit recipients, all revenue in excess of costs shall be: (1) treated as program income; (2) retained by the SDA; and (3) expended on the function or activity which originally produced such excess revenue, if such expenditures are allowable and appropriate and in accordance with cost limitations. Makes such requirement inapplicable unless States are allowed to expend at least 20 percent of their annual allocation on administrative costs. Establishes additional fiscal controls and procurement accountability requirements under the Act. Defines \"profit\" to mean any revenue in excess of expenditures. Increases the maximum portions of specified program funds for a service delivery area which may be used for administrative costs, or for a combination of administrative costs and work experience program costs. Requires the Secretary of Labor to define all cost categories comprehensively. Establishes procurement standards with which all recipients, subrecipients, or service providers receiving funds under the Act must adequately demonstrate that they have complied. Directs the Secretary to issue various regulations relating to such standards, prohibiting conflicts of interest or restrictions of competition, and requiring recipients to perform a cost analysis and price analysis in connection with each procurement action, including contract modifications. Requires each recipient, subrecipient, and service provider to maintain records of revenues and expenditures, for the duration of the grant, subgrant, contract, or other agreement. Requires all expenditures of funds received under the Act to be recorded and reported in the proper cost categories. Requires the Secretary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking within three months, allow at least 60 days for public comment, and issue final regulations within six months. Requires that within-State allocations for training programs for older individuals be in an amount at least equal to that available to carry out such programs for preceding program year. (Current law reserves three percent of the State allotment for such programs.) Requires that at least one member of the State council be the chief administrative officer (or a representative or designee) from the State agencies primarily responsible for administration of programs for older Americans. Directs the Secretary and State Governors to waive, for older workers, performance standards requiring full-time (rather than part-time) employment or relating to wage upon entering at employment. Provides that an individual's participation in specified programs under the Older Americans Act shall not preclude eligibility for programs under the Act. Reserves one percent of the State allotment for SDAs that offer child care services to the children of participants in the TSD program. Requires each State council and SDA to encourage job training providers to provide child care services to the children of participants in such training programs. Requires such providers to make particular efforts to hire older workers and other participants under the Act who desire on-the-job training in early childhood development education. Requires SDAs to make such training available to older workers and other participants. Requires such child care services to comply with all applicable State and local requirements. Requires SDAs, in selecting service providers, to consider the extent to which such a provider makes child care services available to participants. Requires that at least 50 percent of participants in programs in an SDA receiving assistance in the TSD program have two or more of these barriers to employment: (1) reading or mathematics below the eighth grade level; (2) a history of long-term dependency on public assistance programs; and (3) a substantially limited or unsuccessful work history. Establishes a Division of Indian and Native American Programs (the Division) in the Department of Labor which shall be responsible for administering Native American employment and training programs. Sets forth qualifications and duties of the Director and professional staff of the Division. Grants a preference in all personnel actions within the Division to Indians, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians. Establishes a Native American Human Investment Council to solicit the views of the a wide variety of tribes and Native American groups and to advise the Secretary on employment and training program implementation, performance standards, service contracts, program evaluation, and nominees for Director of the Division. Requires such Council to: (1) provide notice of rule making on performance standards at least 30 days before the formal comment period; and (2) report annually to the Congress on the progress of Native American job training programs, with recommendations. Authorizes the Secretary allow the Job Corps centers in any region to exceed the ten percent limitation on non-residential participants by an additional ten percent if: (1) any such increase in the number of nonresidential participants shall be filled by women; (2) such Centers makes child care available to participants at minimal cost; (3) such Centers, in providing such child care, make particular efforts to hire older workers and other participants under the Act who desire on-the-job training in early childhood development education; (4) such Centers make particular efforts to ensure that child care is provided for the children of the nonresidents allowed in such increase; and (5) such child care services comply with all applicable State and local requirements. Establishes a grants program for juvenile offender demonstration projects. Directs the Secretary to award, from specified funds, not more than ten such grants to SDAs, giving priority to those serving demonstration target areas with high proportions of juvenile offenders. Requires such projects to include alcohol and drug abuse counseling and close supervision, counseling, and followup, and to provide at least six months of service to participants. Requires, in addition to general eligibility requirements for the TSD program, that project enrollment be made available to youth referred to service providers by schools, youth commissions, the courts (preadjudication), and after-care programs (post-detention). Requires State labor market information programs to provide training and technical assistance to support comprehensive career guidance and student/client outcome activities for local programs assisted under the Act. Directs the Secretary to engage in research, demonstration, or other activities to determine the feasibility and applications of various methods of organizing, and making accessible nationwide, information on the quarterly earnings, establishment and industry affiliation, and geographic location of employment for use in design and evaluation of education and training programs. Directs the Secretary to then implement such a system across the States to assist employment and training and economic development activities, including safeguards for confidentiality and privacy. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within 24 months on implementation of such system. Directs the Secretary, through the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee, to report to the Congress within 24 months, and biennially thereafter, on recommendations, implications, and schedules for developing a common core of labor market information. Increases the amount of funding for the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee (by changing the current specified maximum limit on such reserved funds to a higher minimum amount availability requirement). Requires such Committee to: (1) give special attention to the career development needs of youth and adults; and (2) conduct research and demonstration projects to improve coordination and compatibility of Federal and State human resources data systems, including economic development assistance systems and implementation support for States. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a methodology to use available data bases to annually identify national labor shortages; (2) as part of such identification, develop information on specified topics; (3) within 18 months and annually thereafter, publish a list of national labor shortages; (4) distribute such list and related information to specified parties and agencies, through various means such as the Interstate Job Bank; (5) conduct research and develop data bases to improve the accuracy of the methodology and make recommendations to identify regional, State, and local labor shortages; (6) report annually to the Congress on such research and development; and (7) submit an annual plan to the Congress, specifying actions to be taken by the Secretary and recommending action for other parties. Authorizes appropriations."
