    "text": "Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 - Requires the United States to implement, beginning in FY 1990, a program to support East European democracy by providing assistance to Eastern European countries which have taken substantive steps toward institutionalizing political democracy and economic pluralism. Designates support for East European democracy activities as SEED. Title I: Structural Adjustment - Directs the U.S. Government, to the extent that Poland and Hungary continue to evolve toward pluralism and democracy and to develop and implement economic reforms, to: (1) mobilize international financial institutions to provide resources to help Poland and Hungary; (2) support the Government of Poland in attacking hyperinflation and other economic problems and relieve urgent balance of payments requirements in Poland; (3) urge all creditor governments to adopt a generous and early debt rescheduling program for Poland and expedite consultations between Poland and such governments to facilitate such rescheduling; and (4) provide agricultural assistance to Poland. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to direct the U.S. executive director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) to urge expeditious approval and disbursement by the Bank of a structural adjustment loan to Poland to facilitate major economic reforms scheduled for early 1990. Declares that the U.S. Government, to the extent that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review of the Polish economy projects a probable balance of payments shortage for the fourth quarter of 1989, should work closely with the European Community and international financial institutions to determine the extent of emergency assistance required by Poland and consider extending a bridge loan to relieve urgent balance of payments requirements. States that the President should seek to ensure that industrialized democracies undertake an immediate effort to respond to Poland's request for $1,000,000 to support economic stabilization programs. Authorizes the President to furnish assistance to Poland for such programs. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the U.S. Government to: (1) make available agricultural assistance to Poland to alleviate food shortages and to facilitate the transition to a free market economy; and (2) encourage parallel efforts by the European Community and other agricultural surplus countries. Sets a minimum level of agricultural assistance for Poland for FY 1990. Directs the President to take actions to encourage innovative approaches to debt reduction of East European countries which have taken substantive steps toward political democracy and economic pluralism. Authorizes the President to undertake the discounted sale to private purchasers of U.S. Government debt obligations of such countries. Permits such a sale only if it will facilitate a debt-for-equity or debt-for-development swap. Title II: Private Sector Development - Authorizes the President to designate two private, nonprofit organizations as the Polish-American Enterprise Fund and the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund to promote development of the Polish and Hungarian private sectors. Authorizes appropriations for the Funds. Permits grants to be made to the Funds only if the Funds are in compliance with this title.

Outlines administrative authorities and types of assistance authorized. Authorizes appropriations.

Permits AID to use the Polish-American and Hungarian-American Enterprise Funds and other appropriate Federal and private agencies and programs to carry out such training. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Prohibits funding for the Farmer-to-Farmer program to be made available under the Food Security Act of 1985 or a similar provision of law. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992 to carry out Peace Corps programs in Poland and Hungary. Permits the use of local currencies generated by the sale of agricultural commodities made available to Poland to: (1) complement certain assistance made available under this Act; and (2) support the activities of a joint commission established under the American Aid to Poland Act of 1988. States that the use of such currencies should emphasize agricultural development in Poland. Declares that it is U.S. policy that: (1) U.S. persons, financial institutions, and other persons may provide financial and technical assistance to credit unions in Poland and Hungary; and (2) federally insured depository institutions may provide technical assistance to such credit unions, to the extent that such assistance is prudent and not inconsistent with safe and sound banking practice. Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to allow Federal credit unions to provide technical assistance to credit unions in Poland and Hungary. Title III: Trade and Investment - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to remove Poland from the list of countries ineligible for designations as beneficiary developing countries. Requires the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to support projects in Poland and Hungary to enhance the nongovernmental sector and reduce state involvement in the economy. Authorizes the Export-Import Bank to extend financial services to Poland and Hungary. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide guarantees to the Bank for liabilities incurred in connection with guarantees or insurance for financing involving exports of goods and services for the private sector in Poland. Limits such guarantees to short-term guarantees and insurance to be repayable within one year of the date of arrival of such goods and services. Permits economic support fund assistance to be made available to discharge such liabilities. Provides for the crediting of subsequent payments to a reserve fund. Limits the aggregate amount of outstanding guarantees. Requires the AID Administrator and the President of the Bank to report biannually to the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the amount and extension of such guarantees and insurance. Authorizes the Bank to charge fees and premiums in connection with such guarantees or insurance. Terminates the President's authority to make such guarantees after FY 1992.

Amends the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to exempt certain Polish bonds from rules relating to below-market loans. Title IV: Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Activities - Declares that the United States should: (1) expand its participation in educational and cultural exchange activities with Poland and Hungary especially activities that assist the development of free market economies in Poland and Hungary; and (2) take action to establish binational Fulbright commissions with Poland and Hungary. States that the President should consider the establishment of reciprocal cultural centers in Poland, Hungary, and the United States to facilitate cultural exchanges. Requires the President to encourage the establishment of \"sister institution\" programs between American and Polish, and American and Hungarian, organizations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992 for such activities. Authorizes the AID Administrator to establish and administer a scholarship program to enable Polish and Hungarian students to study in the United States. Provides that such program shall emphasize scholarships for the study of business and economics. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to provide assistance in study areas related to the development needs of Poland and Hungary. Limits the annual Federal share for such grants to 50 percent of the total amount. Requires States to enlist the assistance of the private sector in meeting the non-Federal share of payments and to encourage the private sector to offer internships or other opportunities to scholarship recipients. Makes available economic support fund and development assistance to carry out such program. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992.
