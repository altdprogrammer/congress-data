    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-08-03", 
    "text": "Voluntary National Service Act of 1990 - Title I: Domestic Voluntary Service - Subtitle A: Establishment and Implementation of Program - Establishes a program of voluntary domestic service (the Program) to be administered by the Director of the ACTION Agency (the Director), acting through the Associate Director for Domestic and Anti-Poverty Operations. Makes individuals age 16 or over eligible to apply to serve as full-time or part-time community service volunteers under such program. Sets forth various types of such national community service to meet the unmet needs of States, local governments, or other communities, including educational services, human services, conservation services, public safety services, and service in existing national programs, such as the Peace Corps and VISTA. Provides for application and placement processes and stipends and educational assistance for volunteers. Subtitle B: Provision of Community Services under the Program - Requires each State Governor to designate an administrator with specified duties for the Program in his or her State. Requires a State community service plan as a condition for State receipt of Program grants. Requires each State to provide certain training for volunteers to perform their community service assignments safely and sucessfully. Requires, in addition to such States training, each volunteer to receive training from the sponsoring government agency or organization in skills relevant to the work to be conducted. Directs the Associate Director to: (1) receive and review State community service plans; and (2) make grants to eligible State to assist them in implementing approved plans and paying volunteer stipends. Sets forth requirements, including State enforcement procedures, for preventing worker displacement due to the Program placements. Title II: International Voluntary Service - Amends the Peace Corps Act to provide for one-year placement of overseas volunteers with a private voluntary organization, with an option for an additional year of such service. Authorizes the President to assign up to 200 volunteers to carry out secretarial or clerical duties on the staffs of the Peace Corps representatives abroad. Directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Education, to pay up to $6,700 of the principal and interest of educational loans incurred by a volunteer, for each complete year of service performed under this Act (with a limitation of $13,400 on the total of such loan repayment for any individual). Provides that such payments shall be in lieu of the cancellation of Perkins direct student loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965 for service in the Peace Corps. Title III: Police Corps Program - Police Corps Act - Establishes an Office of the Police Corps within the Department of Justice, to be headed by a Director appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. Authorizes the Director of the Office of the Police Corps to agree to repay the educational loans of State Police Corps program participants and reimburse them for educational expenses of up to a specified amount following completion of: (1) an educational course of study; (2) Federal training; and (3) four years of State or local police force service. Limits participants in such programs to 15,000 people per year. Declares that the Director's obligation to pay a participant's educational expenses shall be void and the Director shall be entitled to recover from the participant the amount of any interest on an educational loan that the Director has paid if the participant fails to complete the educational study, Federal training, and required service, unless the failure is the result of death or permanent disability. Provides that a dependent child of a law enforcement officer who is not a program participant and who is killed in the line of duty shall be entitled to the educational assistance authorized in this Act without incurring any service obligation. Sets forth selection criteria of and qualifications for participants for State Police Corps programs. Requires each State participating in the Police Corps to make special efforts to seek and recruit minorities without relaxing admission standards. Requires the Director to establish up to three training centers to provide basic law enforcement training to State Police Corps program participants. Requires participants to attend two eight-week training sessions at such training centers and to meet certain performance standards in order to remain in the Police Corps program. Requires the Director to pay participants a weekly stipend during training. Requires a State, in order to participate in the Police Corps program, to submit a plan for implementing such program to the Director for approval. Requires such plan to: (1) include assurances that participants will receive additional State or local training after completing Federal training which shall count toward the four-year service obligation; and (2) provide that program participants shall be assigned to community and preventive patrol in geographic areas with the greatest need for additional law enforcement personnel. Provides for the swearing in of participants as members of the police force to which they are assigned after completing Federal training and meeting the requirements of that police force. Requires the Director to report annually to the President and the Congress. Title IV: Nonmilitary Educational Assistance Programs - Requires that individuals who are serving in any of the voluntary programs established or amended under this Act be eligible during their volunteer service (in the same manner as are volunteers under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973) for deferment of repayment of certain student loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Title V: All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program - Increases basic benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill program for both the active duty program and the selected reserve program. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes appropriations to the ACTION Agency, the Department of Education, the Peace Corps, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs."
