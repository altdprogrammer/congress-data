Requires the Commission to report annually to the President and the Congress on its activities in carrying out this Act. Establishes the National Medicare, Education, and Child Care Lottery Trust Fund. Appropriates to such Trust Fund certain criminal fines (relating to lotteries) and the excess amounts of interest rates of series EE bonds over series LL bonds for a fiscal year. Establishes series LL savings bonds. Provides that purchasers shall be entered into the national lottery one time for each $25 spent. Declares that the conduct of the national lottery shall be a Federal function. Exempts amounts of lottery prizes from Federal taxation. Title II: Disposition of Lottery Revenues - Requires that 50 percent of the amounts in the Trust Fund be divided equally among: (1) the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; (2) the Secretary of Education to carry out programs; and (3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services for child care services under the block grant program to States for social services of the Social Security Act. Requires the use of 40 percent to pay prizes and the remaining ten percent for the administration of the national lottery."
