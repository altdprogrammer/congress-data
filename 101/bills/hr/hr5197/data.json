    "text": "Recycling Promotion Tax Incentive Act of 1990 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a solid waste recycling credit as a general business credit equal to 15 percent of the taxpayer's expense in purchasing qualified recovered material for use in the manufacture or production of a recycled product (other than recycled newsprint), plus $20 for each ton of qualified recovered material for use in the production of recycled newsprint. Provides for the recapture of such credit if the taxpayer uses such material other than in the manufacture or production of a recycled product. Changes the determination of the environmental tax for corporations. Bases such determination on the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate and the Recycling Promotion Trust Fund financing rate. Establishes the Recycling Promotion Trust Fund to consist of appropriated amounts and a percentage of the environmental taxes received in the Treasury. Provides for allocating amounts in such Fund to the States for local and State recycling programs."
