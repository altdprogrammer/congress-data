    "text": "Caribbean Regional Development Act of 1989 - Declares it to be the policy of the United States in providing development and other economic assistance to the Caribbean to: (1) help the poor to participate in the development of their societies; (2) support development that is environmentally sustainable; (3) promote Caribbean self-reliance; (4) increase food security; (5) promote the diversification of industrial and agricultural production; (6) advance the process of regional economic integration; (7) support national programs of economic adjustment that promote the policies of this Act; (8) support employment generation while avoiding the displacement of traditional lines of small-scale production; (9) preserve and reinforce traditional Caribbean culture and social values; (10) consult with the intended beneficiaries of U.S. economic assistance; and (11) sustain the policies set forth in this Act, with adequate funding, for a minimum of ten years. Requires that priority in providing development assistance to the Caribbean shall be given to supporting indigenous Caribbean institutions (including farmers' unions, cooperatives, trade unions and other labor organizations, women's groups, and community organizations) that represent, work with, and benefit the poor. States that for purposes of determining the eligibility of any Caribbean country for development assistance, the per capita income of that country shall be deemed to be no greater than the per capita income for the Caribbean as a whole. Specifies that Economic Support Fund assistance (ESF) shall be used for assistance for those nations in the Caribbean that are experiencing a scarcity of foreign exchange. Provides that to the extent that such assistance is used to finance commodity imports, priority in the use of such assistance shall be given to the purchase of: (1) critical commodity imports by small- and medium-sized industries, farms, and cooperatives that have limited access to foreign exchange; and (2) key consumer goods in critically short supply. Provides that preference in the purchase of commodity imports purchased with ESF funds or with local currencies shall be given to commodities within the Caribbean region. Specifies that in providing assistance to the Caribbean area priority in the allocation of funds provided for development assistance and through the ESF and in the allocation of local currencies shall be given to: (1) food self-sufficiency; (2) integrated rural development; (3) community-based agro-industries; (4) financial resources for small- and medium-sized farm and manufacturing enterprises; (5) expansion of tourism; (6) regional integration; (7) upgrading technical and managerial skills; (8) enhancing the natural resource base; and (9) private sector development.
