Revises provisions regarding biweekly pay periods and the computation of pay to require the hourly rate for Federal firefighters to be determined in the same manner as is currently determined for other Federal employees. Provides that hours of work officially ordered or approved in excess of 108 in a biweekly work period performed by a Federal firefighter are overtime work and shall be compensated in the manner provided for other Federal employees. Requires firefighters in positions requiring them regularly to remain at their stations longer than ordinary periods of duty, a substantial part of which consists of remaining in a standby status rather than performing work, to receive premium pay that does not exceed 25 percent of such part of their basic pay rate. Entitles Federal firefighters to hazardous duty pay when subjected to unusual hazards including exposure to toxic chemicals and firefighting at air crash sites. Sets forth procedures for calculating average pay and actual services for computing annuities for retiring firefighters."
