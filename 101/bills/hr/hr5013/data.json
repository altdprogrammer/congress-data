Prohibits pesticides with cancelled or suspended registrations from being exported to a foreign country unless the exporter, prior to such exportation, has submitted an export notice to the person importing the pesticide, the regulatory office of the importing country, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Sets forth required contents of the export notice. Requires the Administrator, upon receiving a notice from another country or an international agency that prohibits importation of a pesticide with a cancelled or suspended registration and certifies that the pesticide shall not be used or produced in the country, to: (1) notify the public of such notice; and (2) ensure that U.S. exports comply with such notice. Directs the Administrator, upon petition of any person, to allow exports of a pesticide to a country if the country is not complying with its notice or certification. Requires the Administrator to provide technical assistance to foreign countries for developing pesticide regulatory programs. Directs the Administrator to conduct and publish a triennial survey of all countries that import U.S. pesticides or from which the United States imports agricultural commodities to ascertain what procedures are in place in each country for: (1) registration, labeling, and training to ensure safe handling, transportation, application, and disposal of pesticides; and (2) controlling residues on foods to meet tolerances under U.S. law."
