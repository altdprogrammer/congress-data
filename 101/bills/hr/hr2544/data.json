    "text": "Public Service Education Assistance Act of 1990 - Requires that regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management include provisions authorizing Federal agencies to provide training or training costs to enable employees to earn academic degrees in order to recruit or retain employees in shortage or critical skills occupations. Requires Federal agencies to consider the need to maintain a balanced workforce in which women and minorities are appropriately represented in Government service when authorizing such training and selecting employees for student loan repayment benefits. Makes employees ineligible for: (1) such training or benefits if they occupy a position which is excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character; or (2) such benefits if they occupy a position which is not subject to General Schedule pay rates. Directs Federal agency heads to establish a program under which the agency may agree to repay student loans taken out by highly qualified professional, technical, or administrative personnel in order to recruit or retain such personnel. Limits such student loan repayments to: (1) $6,000 per employee in any calendar year; and (2) a total of $40,000 per employee. Requires an employee selected to receive such benefits to agree in writing to: (1) remain in the service of the agency for a specified period unless involuntarily separated; and (2) repay the amount of such benefits to the Government if separated involuntarily on account of misconduct, or voluntarily, before the end of such period. Provides for recovery by the Government of outstanding student loan payments of employees who were separated from Government service before repaying the total amount of benefits received by such employees from their employing agency under this Act. Makes employees receiving such benefits ineligible for continued benefits if they: (1) separate from such agency; or (2) do not maintain an acceptable level of performance."
