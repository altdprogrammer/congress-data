    "text": "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1990 - Title I: Compensation Rate Increases - Increases the rates of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, and the clothing allowance payable to veterans with service-connected disabilities and their survivors. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adjust administratively the rates of disability compensation payable to persons who are not in receipt of compensation for service-connected disability or death. Title II: Technical Corrections and Extensions of Veterans Housing Loan Authorities - Revises the amount of veterans home loans for certain purposes exceeding $144,000 that is automatically guaranteed by the Government. Applies such revisions to loans guaranteed beginning December 18, 1989. Repeals the expiration date of the Secretary's property management authority with respect to property acquired by the Secretary as a result of defaults on veterans' housing loans. Title III: Extension of Certain Health-Care Authorities - Extends: (1) veterans' health-care eligibility based on Agent Orange or ionizing radiation exposure: (2) the authority to make contracts and grants to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in the Philippines; and (3) the authorization for a pilot program of mobile health-care clinics under the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Extends the date until which a veteran may be considered to be a veteran of the Vietnam Era for purposes of disabled veterans' employment and training benefits. Increases the limitation on pension payments from $60 to $90 a month to or for a veteran having neither spouse nor child for any period after the month in which such veteran is readmitted for hospital or institutionalized care by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out administrative reorganizations with respect to the realignment of management responsibility for: (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs Data Processing Centers; and (2) Information Resources Management operational functions and components within the Department's Central Office. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the expenses of leases for regional and field offices for any fiscal year using funds available to the Secretary for such fiscal year for general operating expenses of the Department."
