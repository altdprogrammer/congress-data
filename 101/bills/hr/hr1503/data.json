    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to provide individuals who are subjects of grand jury investigations the opportunity to testify. Allows any individual with respect to whom a felon or party to a plea bargain testifies the right to require that the truthfulness of the witness be tested by polygraph. Requires the United States to furnish any subsequent grand jury (where an indictment was not returned by an earlier grand jury) with: (1) a full description of the action of the earlier grand jury; and (2) all exculpatory evidence presented to the earlier grand jury. Specifies that the Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply to grand jury proceedings. Grants: (1) any person who is a witness before a grand jury the right to be represented by an attorney during grand jury sessions; and (2) such attorney the right to accompany the witness in the room in which the grand jury session is conducted, to provide advice to the witness at any time during a grand jury session, and to cross examine witnesses presented to the grand jury. Provides for the investigation of grand jury leaks by the Attorney General in cases of unauthorized and malicious disclosure."
