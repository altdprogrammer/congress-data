    "date": "1989-07-19", 
    "text": "Fiscal and Institutional Reform Budget Act of 1989 - Title I: Use of Nonadjusted Baseline in President's Budget and Congressional Budget - Amends Federal law to require both the President and the Congress to draft a budget based on estimates of current fiscal year spending, proposing increases or decreases based on this level (rather than on an estimated baseline). Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Congressional Budget Office to use such a current fiscal year baseline in its report to the congressional budget committees, projecting growth for entitlement and discretionary spending based on current fiscal year spending. Title II: Membership of Budget Committees - Amends rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives and rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate to include certain House and Senate leaders and certain other committee chairmen as members of the budget committees. Title III: Joint Budget Resolutions - Replaces the concurrent resolution on the budget with a joint resolution on the budget. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the enactment of an automatic budget resolution if the Congress has not adopted a joint resolution on the budget by May 15 of each year. Sets forth the characteristics of such resolution. Title IV: Appropriations Reforms - Appropriates funds to continue any project or activity provided for in a regular appropriation Act, if such regular appropriation bill does not become law before the beginning of the appropriate fiscal year (automatic continuing appropriations). Requires the separate enrollment of provisions in a continuing appropriations bill. Amends rule XV of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require a rollcall vote on any bill or joint resolution making appropriations or providing revenue. Title V: Enhanced Rescission Authority - Amends the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to allow the President to transmit to the Congress an enhanced rescission message limited to a single item of rescission of budget authority if the public debt is of a specified amount. Authorizes the Congress to revoke any rescission of budget authority by approving and transmitting to the President a resolution of disapproval. Title VI: Treatment of Receipts and Disbursements of Social Security Trust Funds - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to exclude Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund receipts and outlays in Federal deficit determinations. Increases the permissible maximum deficit amounts for FY 1990 through 1993. Establishes allowable maximum deficits for FY 1994 and 1995, to reach zero with respect to FY 1996. Title VII: Effective Dates - States that the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment, with specified exceptions."
