Requires at least 50 percent of the funds appropriated for such activities to be used for grants to universities or research institutions. Directs the Administrator to earmark a portion of such funds for participation in the Small Business Innovation Research Program. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on the impact of products on pollution prevention capabilities, including a list of 50 constituents that have adverse environmental or public health effects when recycled, discarded, incinerated, or treated before disposal and an identification of as many of the products containing such constituents as is practicable. Directs the Administrator to provide funding for projects demonstrating new pollution prevention practices and technologies to: (1) entities responsible for municipal solid waste disposal; and (2) public and private entities. Limits such grants to specified percentages of the total cost of a project. Sets forth criteria to be considered in the awarding of such grants. Requires the Administrator to evaluate such projects to determine the effectiveness and life-cycle costs of such technologies or practices and related social impacts. Directs the Administrator to establish a program of research grants to State and local governments that have solid waste prevention and recycling programs to enable such governments to evaluate the effectiveness of such programs. Requires such governments to report the results of such research to the Administrator. Limits the Federal share of the cost of such research to 50 percent of the total amount. Requires the Administrator to promote the use of, and provide technical assistance for, pollution prevention practices and technologies. Directs the Administrator to establish a Pollution Prevention Information Clearinghouse. Establishes priorities for the Administrator in undertaking pollution prevention research and development and demonstration activities with respect to hazardous and other wastes. Requires the Administrator to report annually to the Congress on the activities carried out under this Act. Authorizes and allocates appropriations."
