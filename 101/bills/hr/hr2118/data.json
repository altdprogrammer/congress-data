Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations by October 1, 1990, for the enforcement of such fee collection. Outlines the services for which the Secretary is authorized to collect such fees, including vessel inspection, vessel documentation, and licensing of personnel. Places a per-fiscal year ceiling on the amount of fees that can be collected. Establishes for each recreational vessel a fee of $25 per year to be collected by the Secretary. Defines \"recreational vessel.\" Outlines administrative provisions concerning the establishment and collection of all fees authorized under this Act, together with penalties for those required to pay such fees who fail to do so. Provides for the deposit of fees collected under this Act to the operating expenses account of the Coast Guard. Authorizes expenditure of the recreational vessel fee funds only for navigational aids and search and rescue operations."
