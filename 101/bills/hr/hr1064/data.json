Makes it unlawful to sell or deliver to, or purchase or receive from, another person for purposes of transportation in such commerce any greyhound for purposes of having such greyhound: (1) race at a facility in which a visual lure that is not artificial or mechanical is used; or (2) trained for racing by means other than an artificial or mechanical lure. Prohibits the use of the of the U.S. mail service or any interstate instrumentality to promote such a facility, unless such facility is outside of the United States. Prescribes penalties for violations of this Act.
