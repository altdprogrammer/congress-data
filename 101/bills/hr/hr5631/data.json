Authorizes the NDS Manager, during FY 1991 and 1992, to obligate specified funds from the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund to acquire materials as authorized under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (the Act). Amends the Act to remove a prohibition on disposals from the stockpile if such disposals would result in an unobligated balance in the Fund in excess of $100,000,000. Authorizes the President to rotate materials in the stockpile in order to prevent technological obsolescence."
