Modifies the project for flood control, Wyoming Valley, Pennsylvania, to direct the Secretary of the Army to complete the design of the project so as to provide flood protection to the area protected by the existing projects from flood conditions which would occur as a result of the recurrence of tropical storms such as Agnes of 1972. Modifies the Sacramento River Flood Control Project to direct the Secretary to proceed in FY 1990 and in subsequent years as necessary with construction of riverbed gradient restoration structures in the vicinity of River Mile 206, Sacramento River, California. Amends the authorization for the Sims Bayou, Texas, project to reflect increased estimates of the project cost. Modifies the project for shoreline protection for the Atlantic Coast of Maryland (Ocean City) to authorize the Secretary to construct hurricane and storm protection measures based on the District Engineer's Post Authorization Change Notification Report dated May 1989. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer and reassign property accountability for the headquarters aircraft of the Corps of Engineers, Serial Number 045, from the assets of the civil works revolving fund to the military activity of the Army that the Secretary determines is appropriate. Requires that the aircraft be made available on a priority basis as necessary for activities in support of the Army's civil works mission. Directs the Secretary to assume operation of the Sledge Bayou Drainage District's structure located in Quitman County, Mississippi. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to requires the Secretary to credit the Federal share of the cost of work by non-Federal interests on the Cherry Street Bridge in Massillon, Ohio, toward the non-Federal share of the cost of construction of the Walnut Street Bridge in Massillon. Directs the Secretary to perform maintenance dredging to maintain Pump Slough from its confluence with the West Pearl River to the boat ramps in the vicinity of Interstate 59 and Crawford and Davis landings. Modifies the project for mitigation of fish and wildlife losses at the Canaveral Harbor West Basin and Approach Channel project, Florida, to authorize the Secretary to construct that part of the project consisting of: (1) reshaping of four spoil islands located in the Banana River; (2) installation of culverts along the existing levee of the south mosquito control impoundment of Merritt Island; and (3) rehabilitation of the existing pump station located at the southern tip of the south mosquito control impoundment. Amends the authorization for the Roanoke River Upper Basin, Virginia, project to reflect increased estimates of project cost. Modifies the project for navigation, Bonneville Lock and Dam, Oregon and Washington, to authorize the Secretary to make available and deliver to specified Oregon and Washington ports excavated material surplus to the needs of such project. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1988 to forgive Aberdeen, Washington's operation, maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation payment obligations in excess of $200,000 for FY 1989 associated with the transfer of responsibility for the Wynochee Dam project from the Corps of Engineers. Designates the lake and recreation area at Dam Site 18 of the Papillion Creek Basin Project in Nebraska as the Ed Zorinsky Lake and Recreation Area. Authorizes construction of the project for flood damage prevention along the Rillito River, Pima County, Arizona. Title II: Department of the Interior - Makes appropriations for FY 1990 to the Department of the Interior for the Bureau of Reclamation for: (1) engineering and economic investigations of Federal reclamation and water conservation projects; (2) construction and rehabilitation projects; (3) operation and maintenance of reclamation projects; (4) loans to irrigation districts for construction of distribution systems on authorized Federal reclamation projects; (5) general administrative expenses in certain Bureau of Reclamation offices; (6) the \"Emergency Fund\" as authorized by an Act of June 26, 1948; (7) acquisition of computer capacity for the Business System Acquisition project and other capital equipment; (8) replacement passenger motor vehicles and aircraft; and (9) recovery of archaeological and paleontological remains in specified areas. Authorizes an appropriation as compensation to the Strawberry Water Users Association which shall be available only for such compensation and must be used for Strawberry Valley Reclamation Project purposes. Requires the Association, upon receipt of such compensation, to relinquish all of its contractual surface rights and interests in the 56,775 acres of Project lands. States that no part of any appropriation for the Bureau, contained in this Act or in any prior Act, which represents amounts earned under the terms of a contract but remaining unpaid, shall be obligated for any other purpose, regardless of when such amounts are to be paid. States that no funds appropriated to the Bureau for operation and maintenance, except those derived from advances by water users, shall be used for the particular benefits of lands: (1) within the boundaries of an irrigation district; (2) of any member of a water users' organization; or (3) of any individual when such district, organization, or individual is in arrears for more than 12 months in the payment of charges due under a contract entered into with the United States pursuant to laws administered by the Bureau. Authorizes the Bureau to accept the services of volunteers.

Requires the Secretary to ensure: (1) that at least ten percent of the Federal funding for the development, construction, and operation of the Superconducting Super Collider be made available to business concerns or other organizations owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; and (2) significant participation with regard to the Collider by such individuals and economically disadvantaged women. Title IV: Independent Agencies - Makes appropriations for FY 1990 for: (1) programs authorized by the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965; (2) salaries and expenses of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board; (3) salaries and expenses of, and the Federal contribution to, the Delaware River Basin Commission; (4) expenses of the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin; (5) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's expenses; (6) expenses of the Office of Inspector General of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; (7) expenses of the U.S. member of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission; (8) expenses of the Tennessee Valley Authority; and (9) expenses of the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board.

States that none of the funds made available under this Act or any other law shall be used for conducting any studies relating to changing from the currently required \"at cost\" to a \"market rate\" or any other noncost-based method for the pricing of hydroelectric power by the six Federal public power authorities or other Federal agencies or authorities. Prohibits appropriations for the Power Marketing Administration or the Tennessee Valley Authority (including funds authorized to be expended from the Bonneville Power Administration Fund and the Tennessee Valley Authority Fund) from being used for procuring extra high voltage (EHV) power equipment unless such agencies award contracts for equipment manufactured in the United States when they determine that there are one or more manufacturers of domestic end products offering a product that meets the technical requirements at a price not exceeding 130 percent of the bid or offering price of the most competitive foreign bidder. Requires that such sums as may be necessary for FY 1990 pay raises for programs funded by this Act be absorbed within the levels appropriated in this Act."
