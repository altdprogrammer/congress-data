Makes the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) responsible for administration and oversight of the Corps. Requires that Corps work projects be consistent with the mission or function of each participating Federal, State, local or tribal land managing agency. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture to assure that such work projects are consistent with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and other prescribed standards. Limits membership in the Corps to individuals who, at the time of enrollment, are: (1) unemployed; (2) 16 through 25 years of age; and (3) U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, or lawfully admitted refugees or parolees. Requires that applicants under 19 years of age give adequate assurances that they did not leave school for the express purpose of enrolling. Makes selection of corps members the responsibility of the chief administrator of each participating land managing agency. Gives membership selection preference to minority youths and to youths residing in rural or urban areas with substantial youth unemployment. Limits the period of Corps enrollment for any member to 24 months, which may be served continuously or in two or three shorter terms. Permits members to complete a continuous term after attaining age 26. Prohibits enrollment solely for school vacation periods. Provides for the establishment of residential and nonresidential Corps camps. Deems Corps members and crew leaders to be Federal employees for specified purposes. Amends the Military Selective Service Act to exempt persons who have completed a two-year enrollment in the corps from induction for training and service, except during the period of a war or a national emergency. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or enter into agreements for the funding and operation of Corps camps with Federal, State, or local agencies or tribal organizations which certify that specified requirements shall be met. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish wage, hour, and working condition standards; (2) provide for the collection and sale of biomass recovered by Corps camp projects; and (3) arrange, with the assistance of the Secretary of Education, for academic credit awards for Corps experience and for academic study by Corps members.
