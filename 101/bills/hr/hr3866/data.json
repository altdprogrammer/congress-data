    "text": "Mineral Exploration and Development Act of 1990 - Sets forth guidelines for mineral exploration on public domain lands. Declares that holders of mining claims executed under under this Act have the exclusive right of possession and may use such land only for mining activities. Prescribes rules for mining claim recordation and use of public land surveys. Mandates user fees to cover administrative expenses. Prohibits the issuance of patents for vein, lode, placer, and mill site mining claims unless administrative requirements are met. Prescribes surface management non-degradation guidelines to which claim holders must adhere or be subject to suspension of operations. Requires claim holders to reclaim mining-affected areas. Provides that no mineral deposit material (including sand, stone, gravel, or clay) shall have such distinct and special value as to be deemed a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of U.S. mining laws. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that all management planning decisions treat public domain lands subject to mineral claims according to environmental guidelines. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to administer Federal mining law activities on National Forest System lands."
