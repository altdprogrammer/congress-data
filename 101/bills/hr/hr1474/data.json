    "date": "1989-03-16", 
    "text": "Community Service Corps Act of 1989 - Title I: Community Service Corps - Establishes the Community Service Corps (CSC), to be administered by Federal agencies and through a State grant component. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to establish the Federal component of the CSC within their agencies to administer programs on Federal lands. Encourages Federal agencies to enter into program agreements with program agencies, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program of grants to States to administer the State component of the CSC involving work on non-Federal public lands and waters. Directs each Governor to designate a State program agency. Authorizes any local government to establish a program agency to carry out the State component within its political subdivision if the State program agency has not been designated at the commencement of a fiscal year. Requires States carrying out such programs to provide mechanisms for participation by local governments and nonprofit organizations. Authorizes the CSC to carry out conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement projects relating to: (1) wildlife habitat, rangelands, parks, recreational areas; (2) urban revitalization and historical and cultural sites; (3) fish and fisheries; (4) roads and trails; (5) erosion, floods, droughts, and storm damage assistance and control; (6) streams, lakes, waterfront harbors, and ports; (7) wetlands protection and pollution control; (8) insect, disease, rodent, and fire prevention and control; (9) improvement of abandoned railroad bed and right-of-way; (10) energy conservation, renewable resources, and biomass recovery; (11) reclamation and improvement of strip-mined land; and (12) forestry, nursery, and cultural operations. Limits such projects to those on public lands or Indian lands, except where the administering Secretary determines that a project involving other lands will provide a public benefit. Encourages any land or water conservation or related program administered in any State under authority of any Federal program to use CSC services. Sets forth formulas for allocation of authorized funds under this title. Title II: Youth Skills Enhancement - Requires the administering Secretary or the Assistant Director (as the case may be) to provide guidance and assistance to States in securing certification of training skills or academic credit for competencies developed under this Act. Directs each program agency to: (1) maintain or enhance, through programs and projects under this Act, the educational skills of program enrollees; (2) assess an entering enrollee's educational level; (3) use at least ten percent of program funds to provide in-service training and educational materials and services for enrollees and persons serving in such projects; and (4) use at least ten percent of program funds for post-service education and training assistance. Directs appropriate State and local officials to certify standards and procedures for awarding academic credit and certifying educational attainment in such programs. Requires such standards and procedures to specify that any person serving in a program or project under this Act: (1) who is not a high school graduate shall participate in an educational component progressing toward a high school diploma or its equivalent; and (2) may arrange to receive academic credit in recognition of learning and skills obtained from service satisfactorily completed. Title III: Administrative Provisions - Sets forth: (1) requirements for award of grants to eligible entities, including matching requirements and limitations on use of funds; and (2) provisions for approval of applications and supervision of programs. Limits enrollment in the CSC to individuals who, at the time of enrollment, are: (1) 16 through 25 years old (15 through 21 years old in summer programs); and (2) U.S. citizens or nationals or lawful permanent resident aliens. Requires that special efforts be made to recruit individuals who are economically, socially, physically, and educationally disadvantaged. Prohibits acceptance for service of any person without a high school diploma or equivalent, unless that person has not been enrolled as a high school student during the three months before the acceptance date. Limits individual enrollment to a total of 24 months. Prohibits individuals (except special members) from remaining enrolled after attaining age 26. Requires the State job training coordinating council to appoint an advisory board for oversight and review of projects under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and succeeding fiscal years to carry out this Act."
