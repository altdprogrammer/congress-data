Transfers jurisdiction over such lands from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) for activities connected with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Directs the Secretary to: (1) submit to the Congress a management plan for the use of such lands; and (2) develop a WIPP performance assessment test plan to ensure compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transuranic waste storage and disposal standards. Directs the EPA Administrator to issue final environmental transuranic waste disposal standards. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the State of New Mexico regarding WIPP-related business and employment opportunities. Provides for payment in lieu of taxes to the State of New Mexico and each local governmental unit for WIPP-related activities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into negotiations regarding just compensation for the holder of a specified Federal potash lease; (2) submit a WIPP decommissioning plan to the Congress within five years after enactment of this Act; and (3) publish in the Federal Register a plan for WIPP land use and management following such decommissioning."
