Directs the President to report to the Congress on the foreign policy and military implications to NATO and to the Warsaw Pact of significant reductions of conventional forces to a ceiling which is the same for both sides. Requires the report to be prepared under two different scenarios: one assuming a 25 percent reduction in NATO levels of personnel and troops and the other assuming a 50 percent reduction in such levels."
