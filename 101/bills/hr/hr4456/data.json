    "text": "Nuclear Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1990 - Requires the President to impose trade and other sanctions against countries that engage in specified nuclear proliferation activities. Requires the President to terminate the primary assistance relationship with a country and, in his discretion, one or more of the secondary assistance relationships, if he determines that such country is a: (1) nonnuclear weapon state which detonates a nuclear explosive device or receives such a device from a nuclear weapon state, enriches uranium to 20 percent or more in the isotope 235 or receives such enriched uranium from any other country, or manufactures or receives weapons-grade plutonium from any other country; or (2) nuclear weapon state which transfers to a nonnuclear weapon state such a device, enriched uranium, or weapons-grade plutonium. Requires the President to terminate one or more of the secondary assistance relationships with a country and, in his discretion, the primary assistance relationship, if he determines that such country is: (1) a nonnuclear weapon state which receives from any other country enrichment equipment, materials, or technology (unless the recipient country has an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to maintain IAEA safeguards) or reprocessing equipment, materials, or technology; or (2) a nuclear weapon state which transfers such items to a nonnuclear weapon state. Requires that, if the President does not terminate the primary assistance relationship with such a country, he shall report his reasons to the Congress. Allows the President to terminate assistance to a country pursuant to any or all of the primary and secondary assistance relationships if he determines that such country: (1) has a safeguards agreement with the IAEA and violates, abrogates, or terminates that agreement; (2) violates, abrogates, or terminates any nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States; or (3) is not a signatory (as of January 1, 1989) to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Requires that, if the President does not terminate assistance with such a country, he shall report his reasons to the Congress. Allows the President to terminate any sanctions imposed pursuant to this Act after a one-year period if: (1) the country's subsequent behavior with respect to nuclear proliferation concerns justifies the termination of the sanctions; and (2) a 30-day period elapses and the Congress does not enact a joint resolution disapproving determination. Allows the President to terminate any sanctions imposed under this Act at any time if: (1) vital national security reasons require termination of those sanctions; and (2) a 60-day period elapses and the Congress does not enact a joint resolution disapproving the President's determination. Allows the President to delay imposing mandatory sanctions under this Act for a period not to exceed 60 days after the President's initial determination, if he determines and reports to the Congress that vital national security reasons require that sanctions not be imposed immediately. Repeals or amends provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Export-Import Bank Act that conflict with this Act."
