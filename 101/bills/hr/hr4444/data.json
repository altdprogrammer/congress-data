Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to submit to the Congress a ten-year Capital Investment Plan (currently, a national airways system plan). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1995 from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund if the Administrator determines that it is necessary to augment or substantially modify elements of such Plan, including, but not limited to, a determination that it is necessary to establish more than 23 area control facilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1995 for: (1) air navigation facilities; and (2) specified research, engineering and development, and demonstration projects. Authorizes appropriations from the balance of moneys available in the Trust Fund for expenses incurrred by the FAA in operating and maintaining the aviation system in a safe and efficient manner. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995 for the costs incurred by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in providing the FAA with weather reporting services. Apportions appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992 from airport development project funds to a specified discretionary fund for preserving and enhancing capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports and airport noise compatibility planning and programs at such airports. Authorizes airport sponsors to assess a facility charge, not to exceed $3, on passengers enplaning at an airport. Makes revenues derived from such charges available for airport improvement activities. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to permit assessment of a passenger facility charge. Title II: Federal Aviation Administration Procurement Reform - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 with respect to leases for terms not in excess of 20 years. Amends Federal law with respect to the procurement authority of the FAA. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to authorize the Administrator of the FAA to procure personal property or services as well as real property on a competitive or noncompetitive basis. Title III: Extension of Aviation - Related Taxes and Airport and Airway Trust Fund Spending Authority - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend for five years: (1) aviation excise taxes regarding transportation of persons and property; (2) certain transfers into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund; and (3) an excise tax imposed upon certain non-commercial aviation fuels. Provides for an increase in such taxes after January 1, 1991. Extends from October 1, 1992, to October 1, 1996, certain spending authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Repeals specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the reduction in aviation-related taxes."
