    "text": "Federal-State Equal Rate Act - Amends the Education of the Handicapped Act (the Act) to increase the amount of the Federal grant to which each State with an approved plan is entitled for assistance for education of all handicapped children by altering the formula for determining such amount to reflect a gradually higher percentage of the national average per pupil expenditure for FY 1991 through 1994 and subsequent fiscal years. Repeals provisions for ratable reductions of such amount. Repeals a restriction on the use of such grant funds to supplant State and local funds. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, with respect to State funds made available to States as a result of the amendments made by this Act, the States should increase the quality of education for their general populations through expending such funds toward: (1) improving teacher-student ratio; (2) increasing teacher compensation; (3) increasing course variety and availability; and (4) improving equipment quality and availability."
