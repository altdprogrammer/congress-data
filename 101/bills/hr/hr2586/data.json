    "text": "Comprehensive Acid Rain Enforcement Act of 1989 - Amends the Clean Air Act to phase in, by 2004, specified nationwide reductions in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from fossil fuel fired generating units and major stationary source industrial process emitters. Requires States to: (1) submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for approval plans establishing emissions limitations, compliance schedules, and other enforceable measures necessary for achieving required sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions reductions; and (2) consider, and make available for public comment, cost and employment impact information regarding the various emission control options before adopting final plans. Provides for the coordination of State plans with respect to electric utilities which serve rate payers in more than one State. Requires a State to biannually quantify its current levels of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions and report its findings to the Administrator on a source-by-source basis. Directs the Administrator to impose a noncompliance penalty against the owner or operator of a stationary source, based on the number of pounds of excess emissions from such source, if the State in which such source is located fails to: (1) submit an implementation plan to the Administrator which is approved; or (2) enforce any requirement of its approved plan against such source. Allows State plans to provide for trading of emission reduction requirements: (1) among electric utility units within a State; (2) between electric utilities and other fossil fuel-fired generating units within a State; and (3) between electric utility units and certain other major sources within a State. Requires fossil fuel fired electric utility generating units to install and operate emissions monitoring for sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen. Requires utility and non-utility fossil fuel fired generating units and major sources of process emissions to maintain, and make available to the public, records on emissions and hours of operation. Authorizes a State to extend for up to two years the date by which a stationary source which utilizes clean coal technology must meet sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions reduction requirements. Excuses State failures to meet emissions reduction requirements when such failures are solely attributable to such extensions or to failure to achieve anticipated reductions from approved clean coal technology projects. Prohibits the increase of annual statewide emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from fossil fuel fired electric utility generating units beyond the emissions level required to be achieved by 2004. Prohibits the early termination of any fossil fuel supply contract by reason of changed circumstances wrought by this Act or State implementation plans. Directs the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator to enter into agreements with, or provide grants to, owners or operators of major sources of air emissions to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the commercial application of clean coal technologies. Requires the utilization of technology which would be appropriate for retrofit and be no more costly in reducing sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions than conventional technology. Requires the Secretary to consider whether the State regulatory authority has found the utility's application of the technology to be prudent before providing the utility with assistance. Limits Federal funding to 50 percent of project costs. Exempts projects which receive assistance for the implementation of clean coal technologies from the Clean Air Act's new source performance standards. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1993. Directs the Administrator to revise the performance standards for sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from fossil fuel fired electric utility steam generating units which commence construction or modification after 1996 so that such standards reflect emissions reduction improvements."
