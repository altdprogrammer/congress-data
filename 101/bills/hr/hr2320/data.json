Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nevada shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nevada which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above apply to national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas, subject to mandatory review by the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires the Secretary to report periodically to the Congress on livestock grazing in these wilderness areas. Declares that the Mount Rose Wilderness shall be available for snowmobiles. Does not preempt State jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in the national forests. Permits the installation in wilderness areas of hydrologic, meteorologic, or climatological collection devices, subject to conditions set by the Secretary."
