    "text": "Computer Software Protection Act of 1990 - Amends Federal copyright law to prohibit the person in possession of a computer software program from renting, leasing, or lending it for direct or indirect commercial advantage unless authorized to do so by the copyright owner. Declares that such prohibition applies for a limited period in the case of a computer program embodied in electronic circuitry of a limited purpose computer designed primarily for playing home video games. Conditions the lending of such computer programs by a nonprofit library for nonprofit purposes upon attachment of a warning of copyright to the packaging. Directs the Register of Copyrights to report to the Congress whether this Act has achieved its purpose of maintaining the integrity of the copyright system while providing nonprofit libraries the capability to fulfill their function. Grants remedies for copyright infringement in cases of violations of this Act."
