    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-17", 
    "text": "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities in specified departments and agencies of the U.S. Government, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Declares that the authorized amounts and personnel ceilings for such intelligence activities are those specified in the classified schedule of authorizations. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1991. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 240 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Provides that such staff shall be administered in the same manner as the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System and Related Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1991. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to eliminate provisions requiring a 15-year career review and an election option for participants in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) Special Category and provisions requiring such participants to remain under CIARDS or in FERS Special Category status for the duration of their CIA service. Specifies that the five years of marriage spent outside the United States required to qualify for former spouse status must have been during periods of the participant's service with the CIA. Permits a retiree under CIARDS who was unmarried at the time of retirement to: (1) elect a survivor benefit upon marriage after retirement (currently, an election for a current spouse can only be made to the extent that a previous election was made for a spouse to whom the participant was married at the time of retirement); and (2) irrevocably elect within one year of marriage after retirement, where his or her annuity was not reduced or fully reduced to provide a survivor annuity at the time of retirement, to provide an annuity for the new spouse in the event such spouse survives the retired participant (in such case, to the greatest extent practicable, the retire participant would be required to deposit an amount by which his or her annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement or, if the annuity was subsequently reduced, the amount by which the annuity would have been reduced had the election been in effect since the date the previous reduction was terminated). Lowers the remarriage age for purposes of entitlement to survivor and retirement benefits under CIARDS. Requires a surviving spouse who remarries a retiree and becomes entitled to a CIARDS survivor annuity fund to choose between such annuity and any other survivor annuity to which he or she may be entitled. Provides for the restoration of benefits of certain former CIA spouses whose benefits were terminated because a of remarriage before age 55 that is later dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to restore health benefits of former spouses whose benefits were terminated because of a remarriage before the age of 55 that is later dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce. Title IV: General Provisions - Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for benefits for Federal employees to be increased as may be necessary for increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law. Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from constituting authority for the conduct of any illegal intelligence activity. Authorizes the DCI to award to a domestic firm a contract that, under the use of competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm if: (1) the DCI determines that it is in the public interest (taking into account U.S. international obligations and trade relations); (2) the final product of the domestic firm will be completely assembled in the United States; (3) when assembled, not less than 51 percent of the final product of the domestic firm will be domestically produced; and (4) the difference between the bids submitted by the foreign and domestic firms is not more than six percent. Places limitations on the application of this provision. Sets forth reporting requirements. Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to grant the use of the DOD reimbursement rate for military airlift services provided by DOD to the CIA if such services are provided in support of authorized intelligence activities. Directs the Defense Mapping Agency to offer certain maps and charts for sale. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold from public disclosure any geodetic product under DOD control that: (1) is restricted pursuant to an international agreement; or (2) contains information that would, if disclosed, reveal sources and methods used to obtain material for geodetic products or review military operational or contingency plans. Permits the Secretary to authorize elements of DOD to engage in commercial activities to provide for security for the conduct of authorized intelligence collection activities abroad. Prohibits such activities from being conducted after September 30, 1995. Sets forth provisions concerning the use, disposition, and auditing of funds generated by such activities. Authorizes the Secretary, if any Federal laws and regulations would create an unacceptable risk of compromise of an authorized intelligence collection activity, to permit the operation of the activity notwithstanding such laws and regulations. Permits personnel to conduct such activities in the United States only to the extent necessary to support intelligence activities abroad. Prohibits entities engaged in such activities from employing, assigning, or detailing U.S. persons to perform duties for such entitles unless such persons are informed in advance of the intelligence security purposes of such activities. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are kept currently and fully informed of such activities. Directs the Secretary to provide to any Member of Congress, upon request, complete access to the Tighe Report (the classified report of the Defense Intelligence Agency relating to efforts to fully account for U.S. military personnel listed as prisoners, missing, or unaccounted for in military actions.) Authorizes the Secretary to withhold from disclosure any material that would compromise sources and methods of intelligence. Title VI: Cambodian Noncommunist Resistance - Restricts assistance for the Cambodian noncommunist resistance forces by limiting any such assistance to nonlethal assistance, requiring that any such assistance be consistent with provisions of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 (relating to the prohibition on assistance to the Khmer Rouge), and making other restrictions. Exempts intelligence collection and sharing funds from such restrictions. Title VII: Incentives for Peace in Angola - Directs the President to promptly certify to the appropriate congressional committees if the Government of Angola expresses its willingness to accept a ceasefire and a political settlement to the conflict in Angola, proposes a reasonable timetable for free and fair multiparty national elections in which the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) would be free to participate, and is no longer receiving aid from the Soviet Union. Specifies that, if the President makes such certification or if the Congress enacts a joint resolution declaring that the Congress has made such a determination: (1) intelligence community funds may not be obligated or expended during FY 1991 for the acquisition of lethal military equipment for UNITA; and (2) the United States shall suspend the delivery to UNITA of any such equipment with previously expended intelligence community funds. Removes such prohibition if the Angolan Government is no longer pursuing a political solution or if there is a military offensive against UNITA. Establishes a certification process, with respect to determinations concerning the Government of Angola's and UNITA's good faith in seeking a ceasefire, the removal of Cuban troops, and a political settlement. Places limitations on the amount of U.S. assistance available for lethal military equipment for UNITA. Sets forth reporting requirements."
