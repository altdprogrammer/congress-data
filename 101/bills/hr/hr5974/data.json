Allows service delivery areas, local governments, employers, employer associations, employee representatives, and private nonprofit organizations to apply to the States for grants to provide such training and education. Directs the Secretary to report biennially on such grants to States and the types of programs assisted. Repeals title VIII (Education and Training) of the Immigration Act of 1990, which provides for education and training assistance similar to that provided under this Act."
