Directs the President to determine whether the property and interest in the property of the Kuwaiti Government and Kuwaiti nationals that was confiscated by the Iraqi Government has been relinquished and returned to the legitimate owners or full restitution has been made. Authorizes the President, if determined that the Iraqi Government has failed to return or make full restitution for such property, to confiscate all property and interest in the blocked property of the Iraqi Government. Makes such confiscated property U.S. property. Authorizes appropriations. Permits the President to waive any of this Act's requirements if it is essential to the U.S. national interests."
