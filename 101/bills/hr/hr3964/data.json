Prohibits an organization which is exempt from Federal taxation under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (a charity) from having officers or directors who are also officers, directors, or agents of a professional fund raising organization employed by the charity. Requires a charity which uses a professional fund raiser to disclose to those solicited the involvement and identity of the fund raiser. Requires a charity to follow uniform accounting principles governing the reporting of fund raising costs, including the percent of expenses used for professional fund raising. Requires the FTC to promulgate such principles. Requires each professional fund raiser to report annually to appropriate State agencies the amounts charged, and raised for, each charity. Preempts inconsistent State or local requirements, subject to waiver, if a State or local requirement affords the public at least as great a level of protection as provided by this Act."
