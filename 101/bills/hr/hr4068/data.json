    "text": "Advanced Rural Telecommunications and Economic Development Act of 1990 - States that a goal of the Federal Government is to make affordable advanced telecommunications services available to all rural residents by the year 2000. Subtitle A: Rural Education, Health Care, and Business Development - Rural Education, Health Care, and Business Partnership Act of 1990 - Chapter 1: Rural Economic Development and Education Partnership - Directs the Administrator of the Rural Development Administration to make grants to enable rural economic development and education partnerships among rural school districts, institutions of higher education, and regional educational laboratories to carry out rural economic and education projects such as adult literacy programs, training programs for displaced families, day care programs, entrepreneurial activities, and rural distance learning curricula using interactive computer technology. Requires State review panels to rank grant applications based on project feasibility, support of area plans, and duplication of existing services for submission by the State coordinator to the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to review such list and make grants to eligible projects and partnerships. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees if the Administrator intends to fund projects other than as recommended by the review panel. Requires the Administrator to monitor the use of such grants and to inform providers of educational services in rural areas about the grant program. Requires the Administrator to allot grant funds to States based on the nonurban population, school age population, and total area of each State relative to the United States. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 2: Health Care and Business Development - Requires any entity desiring aid under this chapter to submit an application to its State review panel. Outlines application requirements, including a detailed explanation of the proposed rural telecommunications system and a list of equipment that the applicant proposes to purchase or lease to implement the system. Requires State review panels to rank grant applications based on project feasibility, support for the area plan, and duplication of existing services for submission by the State coordinator to the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to target the benefits of aid under this chapter to the rural areas and applicants that demonstrate the greatest need. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees if the Administrator intends to fund projects other than as recommended by the review panel. Requires the Administrator to monitor the use of benefit grants. States that the purpose of this section is to provide loan guarantees with respect to loans made to rural providers of medical services in order to improve and increase the use of advanced telecommunications technologies among rural hospitals, rural health care professionals, and rural providers of medical services. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee the timely repayment of loans made to any provider of medical services which: (1) provides such service in a rural area; and (2) is a hospital or health professional authorized to provide such services in that State. Outlines: (1) maximum loan guarantee amounts; (2) special rules; and (3) prohibitions with respect to the provision of such loan guarantees. Requires the Administrator to inform providers of medical services in rural areas of the availability of the program authorized by this chapter. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Administrator to make loans to one or more businesses and entrepreneurs in rural areas to fund facilities in which the recipients of such loans share telecommunications terminal equipment, computers, software, and computer hardware. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 3: General Provisions - Provides that this Subtitle shall not exempt grant or aid applicants from State or local telecommunications laws except to the extent of any inconsistencies. Subtitle B: Miscellaneous Rural Telecommunications Provisions - Rural Telecommunications Act of 1990 - Directs the Administrator to: (1) request the review panel of each State to submit to the Rural Development Administration a report listing the rural areas that will have state-of-the-art telecommunications capability within two years and ranking the areas in the order in which the panel desires data processing firms to locate in such areas; and (2) provide a master list to Federal agencies considering relocating data processing operations. Requires any Federal agency which does not relocate its data processing operation to a rural area selected from such master list to report to specified congressional committees, the Administrator, and the General Services Administration on the reasons for such refusal. Requires the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Small Community and Rural Development to make grants to eligible local governments for the development and installation of emergency public safety telephone answering systems. Limits individual and aggregate grant amounts. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study of and evaluate: (1) the availability and effective use of the telephone communications infrastructure by small and large businesses in rural areas; and (2) the achievements and shortcomings of existing programs to improve the rural business environment through telecommunications. Authorizes the Secretary to recommend to the Congress such legislation as will promote rural economic development through advanced telecommunications technology."
