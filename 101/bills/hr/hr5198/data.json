    "text": "Minority Farmers Rights Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Small Community and Rural Development, to implement policies and programs to assist minority farmers, including programs to increase ownership, prevent discrimination, and prevent the contraction of the minority agricultural landbase. Directs the Secretary, with regard to the minority landbase, to: (1) provide for the use of Federal and State land inventories to maintain such landbase; and (2) assist in the creation of minority land banks. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to extend allocation authority for specified agricultural real estate and operating loans. Sets forth specified targeted participation rates and other minority farmer assistance provisions for the Department of Agriculture. Amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to direct the Secretary to provide outreach education and technical and legal assistance to assist minority farmers. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to establish for each agency within the Department: (1) affirmative action programs; and (2) minority contracting goals. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to encourage and assist minority youth and minority first-time farmers to participate in farming and rural development careers. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to permit, under specified conditions, a previous owner, a beginning farmer, and a socially disadvantaged farmer to buy Farmers Home Administration inventory land at the land's productive value rather than its higher market value. Sets forth a Department appeals process for discrimination complaints."
