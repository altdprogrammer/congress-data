Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with each Indian tribe, to prepare and submit plans to the Congress for the use and distribution of such funds within 180 days of this Act's enactment. Provides that such funds may not be used or distributed until a membership roll of Seminole Indians has been certified by the Secretary. Specifies that any plans for the investment, use, or distribution of such funds shall account for common tribal needs, educational requirements, and long-term economic and social interests of the affected tribe. Directs the Secretary to implement such plans 60 days after their submission unless the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving such plan. Requires that tribal investment decisions under such plans be subject to the Secretary's approval. Declares that the funds allocated to each Indian tribe under this Act are to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of such tribe."
