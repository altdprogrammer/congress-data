    "text": "Island Protection Act of 1989 - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to require, for fiscal years after 1990, each comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan to specifically address islands within the relevant State as an important outdoor recreation resource as a prerequisite for approval by the Secretary of the Interior, unless the State submits and the Secretary approves as part of an existing plan an island protection program developed in consultation with the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to update the 1970 National Park Service (NPS) Study entitled \"Islands of America.\" Directs the United States Geological Survey to provide such maps and other geographical data as necessary to complete the updating. Specifies that such study shall include: (1) an inventory of all public lands located on islands and a review of the management plans of the Federal agencies exercising administrative jurisdiction over such lands; (2) information regarding the extent to which the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources of islands covered by the 1970 study have been protected by Federal, State, local, and private programs and laws; (3) information regarding the extent to which island resources covered by the 1970 study have been, or are being, damaged or impaired by development activities, including federally permitted or subsidized activities; (4) an evaluation of the trends affecting the development of islands; (5) an assessment of the islands covered by the 1970 study that may be qualified for inclusion in the national wilderness system, NPS, or other Federal land management designation; and (6) an inventory of all islands that have been listed on the nationwide rivers inventory, have been found to qualify for designation as wild and scenic rivers, or which are part of the national trails system. Directs the Secretary to establish a program within NPS to provide technical assistance to State and local governments and private nonprofit organizations for the protection of threatened island resources and the development of island specific plans and strategies. Specifies that: (1) such technical assistance shall include assistance to enable island communities to maintain their historic and traditional identities, preserve fish and wildlife habitats, and reconcile pressures for community growth with the conservation of natural and cultural resources; and (2) the program shall include a clearinghouse for information regarding successful projects which can potentially be utilized for the protection and preservation of island resources and workshops on land acquisition techniques, financing methods, management options, and community participation alternatives to educate government and community leaders on various island protection strategies. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program of loans or grants-in-aid to private nonprofit organizations or State, local, or regional government agencies engaged in island conservation or recreation enhancement to provide or support: (1) innovation, leadership, and excellence in conserving outdoor recreational resources; (2) the dissemination of information on projects of significant merit; (3) projects which demonstrate innovative ways of protecting land resources for outdoor recreation; and (4) other relevant projects. Sets forth application requirements and eligibility guidelines for financial assistance. Requires the Secretary to maintain, publish, and make available to Federal and State agencies a Register of Federally Protected Island Resources. Sets forth additional requirements with respect to the designation of federally protected island resources."
