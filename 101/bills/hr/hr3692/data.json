    "text": "Competitive Wholesale Electric Generation Act of 1989 - Authorizes public utility holding companies that are exempt from the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 to acquire business interests in generators used exclusively for selling electric energy at wholesale (exempt wholesale generators). Declares that the ownership of exempt wholesale generators shall not result in the owner's being considered as primarily engaged in the sale or generation of electric power under the Federal Power Act. Preserves the ratemaking authority of the States. Defines circumstances under which electric energy charges by a public utility exempt wholesale generator will be considered unjust and unreasonable."
