Requires the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, to prepare and submit to the Congress a baseline report on indigenous and tribal peoples in developing countries, including a discussion of the effects of U.S. bilateral and multilateral assistance. Requires the Administrator to consult with U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations with experience in monitoring and reporting on indigenous and tribal peoples, and with other interested persons, throughout the preparation of such report. Requires AID (in consultation with the Department of State) to use such organizations to monitor and analyze the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in developing countries on a regular basis. Requires the Administrator to prepare and submit to the Congress annual reports concerning the monitoring of indigenous and tribal peoples and updating of the required baseline report. Requires that a description of proposed activities to address the problems facing indigenous and tribal peoples be included in such report. Requires the Secretary of State to include in each annual human rights report submitted to the Congress a discussion of each country's observance of and respect for the human rights of the indigenous and tribal peoples in that country."
