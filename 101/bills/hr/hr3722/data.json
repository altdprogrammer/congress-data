Directs the Director to conduct the following studies: (1) an examination of the unfinished agenda described in the final report of the Management Committee of Long Island Sound; (2) a 20-year growth assessment of the adequacy of wastewater treatment facilities serving the Sound with respect to estimated increases in population and usage of such facilities; (3) a survey of public access issues relating to the Sound and the development of a map describing such access; (4) an examination of contaminated sediments and of dredging activities in the Sound; (5) an examination of nonpoint source pollution in the Sound; (6) an examination of wetlands protection issues; (7) an assessment of effective methods of nitrogen removal to abate pollution in the Sound; (8) an examination of atmospheric acid precipitation and deposition into Sound waters; (9) an assessment of water quality issues; and (10) an assessment of recreational uses and demands in the Sound. Prohibits the Director from duplicating any study for which a comparable study exists. Requires the Director, acting through the Committee, to conduct a demonstration project for the removal of: (1) toxic materials from contaminated sediments in the Sound; and (2) nitrogen from pollutants in Norwalk Harbour in the Sound.
