Requires each State receiving such funds to designate a lead agency to conduct such scholarship program. Makes the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Justice Programs responsible for administration of such program and for issuing regulations. Provides that such a scholarship shall be for one academic year and may be used at any accredited institution of higher education. Conditions eligibility on an individual's having been employed in law enforcement for two years immediately preceding the date for which scholarship assistance is sought. Requires each individual awarded a scholarship to work in a law enforcement position in the State which made the award for a period of one month for each credit hour of financial assistance (with a six-month minimum and two-year maximum). Authorizes appropriations."
