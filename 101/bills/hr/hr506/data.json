Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local jurisdictions to develop hazardous materials transportation plans. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide training centers concerned with hazardous materials transportation incidents; and (2) make grants to States and local jurisdictions to purchase equipment to be used in handling incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose an excise tax upon the shipment of hazardous materials; and (2) establish in the Treasury the Hazardous Materials Trust Fund."
