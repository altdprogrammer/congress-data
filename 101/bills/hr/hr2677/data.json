Requires that such system identify potential adverse drug reactions that may result from: (1) the interaction of the prescribed drug with other drugs being used by the beneficiary and with a known allergy, physical condition or illness presented by the beneficiary; and (2) misuse of the prescribed drug. Requires that participating pharmacies, pharmacists and dispensing physicians having access to the System agree that: (1) no beneficiary will be required to disclose medication profile information as a condition of receiving benefits; (2) the beneficiary's medication profile will not be accessed without the beneficiary's specific and voluntary authorization; (3) data acquired will not be disclosed to anyone other than the beneficiary, except when consultations between those involved in the beneficiary's health care are medically necessary; and (4) each beneficiary shall receive written notice of such requirements. Penalizes, by fine and/or imprisonment, those guilty of the unauthorized disclosure of medication profile information. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study and report to the Congress by October 1, 1992, on the efficacy of expanding the System to include all Medicare-eligible outpatients who are inpatients and information on over-the-counter drugs and biologicals."
