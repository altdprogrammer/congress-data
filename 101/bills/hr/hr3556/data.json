Limits assessments of underpayments with respect to taxable periods beginning after the date of enactment of this Act in connection with such tax. Abates assessments and mandates refund of overpayments of any post-1987 tax. Places additional limitations on the deductibility by a C corporation of interest on corporate stock acquisition indebtedness, denying a deduction for such interest in excess of $5,000,000 incurred in connection with any acquisition of stock pursuant to the acquiring corporation's plan to acquire 50 percent or more (by vote or value) of the stock in a corporation."
