    "text": "Title I: Federal Minimum Wage - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (the Act) to increase the minimum wage per hour from $3.35 in 1989 to: (1) $3.65 in 1990; (2) $3.95 in 1991; and (3) $4.25 in 1992 and thereafter. Increases the tip credit under the Act from 40 percent to 45 percent for 1990 and to 50 percent for 1991 and thereafter. (The tip credit deems the amount paid to a tipped employee, for minimum wage purposes, to be increased by an amount determined by the employer, but not by an amount in excess of the specified percentage of the applicable minimum wage rate.) Increases the small business exemption by revising the definition of an enterprise engaged in commerce, for purposes of coverage under the Act (\"the enterprise test\"). Exempts from such coverage enterprises whose annual gross volume of sales or business is less than $500,000 (currently $362,500), effective in 1990. Requires employers who were covered in 1988, but who are exempt under the new threshold, to continue to pay the $3.35 per hour minimum wage. Title II: Earned Income Tax Credit - Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions governing the earned income tax credit to: (1) increase from $5,714 to $7,000 the amount of earned income subject to the credit; (2) increase the basic credit from 14 percent to 15 percent; and (3) add additional credits to apply to not more than four children of 5 percent for each dependent school age child between age 6 and age 16 and ten percent for each preschool age child. Reduces the amount of the credit for taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $40,000. Indexes amounts relating to the credit beginning in 1992. Disallows application of the nonrefundable dependent care income tax credit with respect to a taxpayer's dependents under age 13, unless the child is physically or mentally incapable of self-care. Permits the credit with respect to handicapped children under age 15 only if the taxpayer elects not to include the child within the framework of the earned income credit. Repeals provisions of the Family Support Act of 1988 that revise the way in which the earned income credit is treated in the context of needs analysis for purposes of State plans for aid and services to needy families with children under title IV of the Social Security Act."
