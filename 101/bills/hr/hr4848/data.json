Requires the Administrator to require the suspension or revocation of any certificate issued to such an individual, or his or her dismissal, where the individual has used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of Federal law or regulations. Prohibits such persons from using alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of Federal law or regulations and serving in their capacity as an air carrier employee. Prohibits violators from serving in such capacity unless they have completed a program of rehabilitation. Sets forth specified requirements for such rehabilitation programs. Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to require the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to issue regulations which require railroads to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, periodic recurring, and post accident testing of all railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions for illegal use of alcohol or a controlled substance. Directs the Secretary to disqualify for an established period of time, or dismiss, a railroad employee found to have used or to have been impaired by alcohol while on duty, or a controlled substance whether or not on duty. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations for rehabilitation programs which provide for treatment for railroad employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of alcohol or a controlled substance. Amends the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 to require the Secretary to issue regulations which require motor carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, periodic recurring, and post accident testing of operaters of commercial motor vehicles for illegal use of alcohol or a controlled substance. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations for rehabilitation programs which provide treatment for operators of motor vehicles who have been found to have used alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of Federal law or regulations. Requires the Secretary to determine appropriate sanctions for violations of this Act. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to require the Secretary to issue regulations which require recipients of assistance under this Act to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, periodic recurring, and post accident testing of operators of mass transportation vehicles for use of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of Federal law or regulations. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations for rehabilitation programs for treatment of operators of mass transportation vehicles who have been found to have illegally used alcohol or a controlled substance. Requires the Secretary to determine appropriate sanctions for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to design a pilot test program for the testing of operators of commercial motor vehicles on a random basis to determine whether an operator has illegally used alcohol or a controlled substance. Requires such program to be administered as part of the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. Provides that such program shall last for one year."
