Makes the extension contingent on the beneficiary notifying the plan administrator of the determination. Terminates extended coverage in the month following a final determination that the beneficiary is no longer disabled. Requires a recipient who is determined to have been disabled at the time of termination or reduction in hours to notify the plan administrator: (1) within 60 days of that determination; and (2) within 30 days of any final determination that the beneficiary is no longer disabled."
