Gives priority to centers: (1) receiving State or political subdivision support not connected to any Federal program; or (2) in areas where a trauma center has ceased participation, or because of uncompensated costs will be unable to participate, in the trauma care system. Limits support for a center to three years, subject to extension by the Secretary for one additional year. Authorizes appropriations."
