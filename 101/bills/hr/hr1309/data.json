    "text": "Amends Federal armed forces law to repeal legislative veto provisions in various areas, including: (1) defense contracting and procurement; (2) military construction; (3) restoration or replacement of damaged or destroyed facilities; (4) naval vessels; (5) administration of naval petroleum reserves; (6) disposal of obsolete or surplus material; (7) the acquisition of land for use as military test sites; and (8) the reduction of active-duty service periods for members of the armed forces. Amends the War Powers Resolution to specifically empower the Congress to declare war. Repeals certain limitations placed upon the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce U.S. armed forces into hostilities. Amends the Resolution to require that, where consultation is required under it, the President shall consult with: (1) the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives; and (2) the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate. Requires the President and such Members to establish a schedule of regular meetings to ensure adequate consultation on national security issues. Requires that, whenever a majority of such Members so request, the President shall consult with a permanent consultative group (to be established within the Congress under this Act) unless the President determines that limiting consultation to such Members is essential to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting the most vital security interests of the United States. Requires the membership of the permanent consultative group, in addition to such Members, to include the chairmen and ranking minority members of the House and Senate committees on foreign affairs, armed services, and intelligence. Requires reports from the President to the Congress: (1) in any case in which the number of U.S. forces equipped for combat and located in a foreign country are substantially reduced; and (2) upon the termination of the involvement of U.S. armed forces in hostilities. Repeals provisions of the Resolution requiring the President to terminate any use of U.S. armed forces: (1) within 60 days after such use is required to be reported to the Congress under the Resolution, unless the Congress specifically authorizes their continued use; or (2) if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution. Provides that, whenever U.S. armed forces are engaged in hostilities or other situations described in a report submitted (or deemed to be required to be submitted) by the President under the Resolution without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, it shall be in order in the Senate or House to consider a joint resolution (approved by the permanent consultative group) which either: (1) requires the President to disengage or remove such forces; or (2) provides specific authorization for their continued engagement or use. Sets forth expedited procedures for such a resolution. Directs the permanent consultative group to hold such meetings as may be necessary to carry out its responsibilities whenever such meetings are called by the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, or a majority of its membership."
