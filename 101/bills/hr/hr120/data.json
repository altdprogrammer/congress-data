    "text": "Child and Family Development Act - Declares that the Congress affirms the right and responsibility of parents to participate in programs involving their children and that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize any public agency or private organization or its representative to intervene in any child-rearing decision of the parents. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a complete study and assessment of child care needs in the United States. Directs the Secretary to take specified factors into consideration and to complete such study and assessment, and transmit the results to the Congress, within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to prepare and promulgate a comprehensive plan and program to provide services to meet the Nation's child care needs (including day care, education, health, and nutrition). Sets forth requirements for the plan and program. Directs the Secretary to promptly transmit the plan and program, with recommendations, to the Congress. Requires that a specified minimum period of time after transmittal to the Congress pass before the plan or program or later modifications by the Secretary become effective. Sets forth priorities in the distribution of child care funds by the plan and program. Prohibits the plan and program from affecting levels or sources of funding for the Head Start program and specified programs under the Social Security Act and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Requires that such plan and program provide for strengthened developmental programming for children and parent education and required certification of teachers under such Acts. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual report, with recommendations, to the Congress on the administration and operation of this Act and of the plan and program. Authorizes appropriations."
