    "text": "National Energy Efficiency Act of 1990 - Establishes as a national goal the identification of policies that have the potential of stabilizing and reducing the generation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the United States. Title I: Energy Policy Initiatives - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to mandate that the first National Energy Policy Plan submitted by the President to the Congress (and each subsequent Plan) include a least-cost energy strategy prepared by the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary). Prescribes strategy guidelines. Amends the Energy Security Act to repeal energy target provisions. Directs the Secretary to appoint a Director of Climate Protection within the Department of Energy to participate in: (1) global climate change policy considerations; and (2) least-cost energy strategy considerations. Title II: Energy Efficiency Initiatives - Requires the Secretary to submit periodic evaluations to the Congress regarding energy efficiency policy options necessary to produce certain percentage decreases in U.S. energy use. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) to set a deadline by which each Federal agency must: (1) install energy conservation measures in its Federal buildings with specified payback periods; (2) submit a list of projects to the Secretary which meet such payback criterion and indicate total energy and cost savings involved; and (3) have substantially completed at least 25 percent of such projects, or those projects that would account for 25 percent of total energy savings. Directs the Secretary to develop guidelines with respect to the selection of energy service contractors. Requires the Secretary of Energy to study and report on the monetary value of the environmental benefits resulting from energy efficiency improvements in Federal buildings. Amends the NECPA to repeal the prohibition against the supply and installation of residential energy conservation measures by utilities. Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to support a voluntary, national window rating program to develop window energy ratings and labels. Mandates that such program be administered by the National Fenestration Rating Council which shall report periodically to the Congress and the Secretary regarding the program's status. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe labeling rules for windows and window systems. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to support a voluntary, national program to devise guidelines for industrial insulation that reflect the benefits that can be achieved by appropriate insulation levels. Mandates that such guidelines be issued by a nonprofit organization by a specified deadline. Requires the Secretary to review the status of industrial energy auditing procedures; (2) conduct an educational and technical assistance program concerning the guidelines and auditing procedures; and (3) report to the Congress regarding such program and the guidelines, including the responsiveness of the industrial sector to the guidelines. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration to report to the Congress regarding the acquisition of energy efficiency information. Requires the Secretary to submit a feasibility report to the Congress regarding the mandatory use in Federal facilities of compact fluorescent lamps instead of incandescent lamps. Amends the NECPA to direct the Secretary to: (1) promulgate procedural guidelines enabling the States to assign energy efficiency ratings to residential buildings; and (2) establish a technical assistance program for State and local governments adopting energy efficiency rating systems or building codes. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to mandate that State regulatory commissions consider a least-cost ratemaking standard under which utility investments in demand-side measures shall be as profitable as investments in new generation facilities (thus creating an economic incentive for utilities to promote residential energy conservation measures). Requires the Secretary to report to the President and the Congress an evaluation of: (1) the results of least-cost planning methodologies implemented by electric utilities; and (2) the extent to which ratemaking methodologies implementing least-cost planning take into account the impact of such measures on electric utilities' profitability. Removes the size limitations placed upon solar, wind, and geothermal electric energy facilities eligible for PURPA regulatory benefits. Amends the Federal Power Act to make conforming amendments and to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue regulations reflecting such amendments. Title III: Energy Supply Initiatives - Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress the results of an assessment of the statutory, economic, and regulatory barriers to expanded hydroelectric capacity development at existing dams. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to set forth the purposes of the interagency working group with respect to the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency resource technologies. Directs such group to develop and disseminate a comprehensive data base and information dissemination system on: (1) specific energy technology needs of lesser-developed countries; (2) the competitiveness of various renewable energy and energy efficiency resource technologies; and (3) the status of ongoing technology assistance programs. Requires the group to report biennially to the Secretary and the Congress regarding the full range of energy and environmental technologies necessary to meet the energy needs of developing countries while reducing the greenhouse gas generation. Authorizes the group to establish renewable energy industry outreach offices in the Pacific Rim and the Caribbean Basin. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress the results of a comparative fuel cycle cost analysis with respect to the United States, Europe, and Asia. Amends the NECPA to require the Secretary to: (1) conduct a fuel cell systems demonstration program in Federal buildings; and (2) report to the Congress on the program's implementation. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements or joint ventures with certain urban area transit authorities to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural gas or other alternative mass transit fuels. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to implement and finance a fleet vehicle program for the commercialization of natural gas and other alternative fuels. Authorizes appropriations."
