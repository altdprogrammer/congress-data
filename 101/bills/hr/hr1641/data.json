Provides that the compensation allowed to any covered World War II underground fighter shall be five dollars for each day he served as a guerrilla fighter or concealed himself from hostile forces. Provides that any claim allowed by the Commission shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury and paid by such Secretary. Declares that any claim must be filed with the Commission within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires the Commission to complete its determination for any such claim no later than one year after such claim is filed. Authorizes appropriations."
