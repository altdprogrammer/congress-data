    "text": "Fish Quality and Vessel Inspection Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish standards for fishing and fish processing vessels; and (2) make recommendations for the quality of fish harvesting waters. Provides for standards regarding the grading and the identity, quality, packaging, and labeling of fish and fish products. Directs the Secretary to implement a system for vessel registration under which a vessel's registration may be suspended for failure to permit inspection or if the Secretary finds a reasonable probability of serious or adverse health consequences or death. Directs the Secretary to establish an inspection program including intensive sampling for chemical and microbial contaminants, parasites, and toxins. Allows the Secretary to detain fish and fish products the Secretary has reason to believe are in violation of standards. Directs the Secretary to develop a program for the regular monitoring of waters in the Exclusive Economic Zone from which fish are harvested. Authorizes the Secretary to close waters that do not meet standards or that present a risk to human health. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into agreements with Federal and State agencies and foreign governments to conduct registrations and inspections; and (2) provide for an official mark signifying that fish or fish products meet grade and trade standards. Directs the Secretary to establish a program for the education and training of private and State employees involved in implementing this Act. Makes it unlawful to: (1) fail to meet any standard; (2) fail to register a vessel; (3) fail to provide access to documents for inspection; (4) use an unapproved or counterfeit mark or use an official mark in an unapproved manner; or (5) harvest from closed waters. Sets forth civil monetary penalties. Prohibits discrimination against any employee because the employee has participated in the implementation of this Act."
