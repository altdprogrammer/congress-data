Provides that the purpose of such assistance is to help the poor majority of sub-Saharan Africans to participate in development through economic growth that is equitable, participatory, environmentally sustainable, and self-reliant. Requires the Agency for International Development (AID) to take into account the local-level perspective of poor sub-Saharan Africans during the planning process for such assistance.
