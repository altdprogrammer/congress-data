Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) arrange with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences for a study assessing the implementation of directed health care decisions; and (2) develop and implement a demonstration project in selected States to inform the public of the option to execute advance directives and a patient's right to participate in and direct health care decisions."
