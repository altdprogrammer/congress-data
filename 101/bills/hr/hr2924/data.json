    "text": "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 - (Titles I-III: Reserved) - Title IV: Committee on Energy and Commerce - Subtitle A: Medicare - Part A: Provisions Relating to Part B of Medicare - Subpart 1: Payment for Physicians' Services and Related Professional Services - Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to phase-in, from 1990 to 1993, Medicare payment for physician services pursuant to a fee schedule which is based upon the relative value of the resources devoted to each physician service. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adjust fee schedule amounts to take into account geographical variations in resource values and to make the transition to such payment methodology budget neutral. Prohibits the Secretary, after 1990, from making variations in the relative value of a physician service turn on whether the physician is a specialist or such service is his or her specialty. Requires that, after 1991, classification and coding of physician services: (1) be uniform for the same physician service in all fee schedule areas; (2) include pre-operative and post-operative physician services with related surgical procedures; and (3) differentiate evaluation and management services (primary care) on the basis of the time spent in providing different primary care services. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, by July 1, 1991, on whether geographical variations in fee schedules should be based on variations in resource values among States or between urban and rural areas. Factors malpractice expenses into the relative value of a physician service. Phases-in, from 1991 to 1993, the limitation of a nonparticipating physician's actual charge for a service to 120 percent of the fee schedule amount for such service. Provides for no increase in the Medicare economic index for physician services in 1990. Makes resource-based geographical variations in Medicare payments for physician services applicable to radiology services. Prohibits the rounding of fractional time units in calculating Medicare payments for anesthesia services. Establishes separate uniform national fee schedule conversion factors for nurse anesthetist services furnished under the direction of a physician and for other nurse anesthetist services. Prohibits Medicare payments for a suregon's direction of a nurse anesthetist. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to expand and extend a program reimbursing certain rural hospitals for the costs of nurse anesthetists, rather than reimbursing nurse anesthetists directly. Amends part B of the Medicare program to make payments for physician pathology services pursuant to a fee schedule and geographical area adjustments comparable to such adjustments made for other physician services. Prohibits Medicare carriers from recovering certain part B overpayments made between July 1, 1985, and March 31, 1986. Subpart 2: Payments for Other Services - Accelerates the use of regional rates in calculating Medicare payments for durable medical equipment. Narrows the range of acceptable purchase prices for such equipment. Covers parenteral and enteral nutrition equipment as durable medical equipment. Reduces Medicare payments for seat-lift chairs, power-operated vehicles, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators. Treats: (1) power-driven wheelchairs as routinely purchased durable medical equipment; and (2) ostomy supplies as home health services which home health agencies must provide to beneficiaries who need them. Lowers the payment ceiling for a clinical laboratory test to 95 percent of the median of all fee schedules established for that test for that setting. Allows Medicare payments for such tests to be made to the referring laboratory only if it is located in, or is part of, a rural hospital or submits payment requests for tests of which no more than 30 percent in any year are performed by another laboratory. Eliminates the requirement that a fee schedule for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests be established on a nationwide basis. Repeals the requirement that physician office laboratories performing over 5,000 tests a year be treated as independent laboratories that must meet State and local license requirements. Reduces capital payments for outpatient hospital services provided during FY 1990. Provides Medicare cost-based reimbursement to health centers which: (1) provide the services rural health clinics are authorized to provide; and (2) meet the requirements for receiving a grant under the Public Health Service Act or were treated, under part B, as comprehensive federally funded health centers as of January 1, 1989. Raises the ceiling on payments for physical and occupational therapy services. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to specified congressional committees on the provision of such services under the Medicare program. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the adequacy and appropriateness of Medicare payments for ambulance services. Requires the Physician Payment Review Commission to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the adequacy and appropriateness of Medicare payments for assistants at surgery. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and report to specified congressional committees on the effect the part B methodology for reimbursing for blood clotting factor for hemophilia patients has on the accessibility and affordability of such factor to beneficiaries. Subpart 3: Changes in Coverage and Miscellaneous - Eliminates the limitation of covered psychologist services to services furnished at community mental health centers. Covers services performed by a clinical social worker for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses. Requires such psychologist or clinical social worker to document in the patient record that: (1) the patient has been informed of the desirability of conferring with his or her physician; and (2) the patient's physician has been notified that services are being provided to the patient or has been directly consulted concerning medical conditions that may be contributing to the patients' condition. Eliminates the dollar limitation on covered mental health services. Covers the services of a nurse practitioner working in collaboration with a physician. Makes Medicare payments for such services to the nurse practitioner's employer. Requires Medicare carriers to permit routine part B payments for up to 1.5 monthly visits per resident of a nursing facility by a member of a team which includes a physician and physician assistant and/or nurse practitioner. Directs the Secretary to establish at least one demonstration project applying such limitation on visits on an average basis over the aggregate total of nursing facility residents served by team members. Covers a screening pap smear for women who have not undergone such a test during the preceding three years or for a shorter period set by the Secretary for Women at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Requires rural health clinics to have a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or certified nurse-midwife available to furnish patient care services at least 50 percent of the time the clinic operates. Covers social worker services furnished to outpatients of rural health clinics. Expands the area within which rural health clinics may be located. Directs the Secretary to provide health care facilities and the chief executive officer, chief health officer, and chief human services officer of each State with applications and information enabling such facilities to apply for rural health clinic designation under the Medicare or Medicaid (title XIX of the Act) program. Prohibits the Secretary from denying the certification of a facility as a rural health clinic if such facility is located on an island and would meet certification requirements but for the requirement that physician assistant or nurse practitioner services be provided in the facility. Requires that Medicare payments for physician services furnished to Medicaid beneficiaries be made only on an assignment-related basis. Directs the Physician Payment Review Commission to review the adequacy and appropriateness of Medicaid payments for physician services. Part B: Provisions Relating to Parts A and B of Medicare - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to extend, through 1993, the application of a waiver of the Medicare requirement that health maintenance organizations (HMOs) must have an enrolled population of which not more than 50 percent are Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to HMOs which had a pre-existing waiver of such requirement and received specified grants in FY 1987. Amends the Medicare program to limit physician charges for emergency services or out-of-area coverage provided to an HMO enrollee by a person who is not under contract with such HMO. Requires the Secretary to give HMOs annual notice of proposed changes in the methodology used or assumptions made in calculating payment rates for each class of HMO enrollee. Eliminates HMOs from the prohibition against making payments to physicians as an inducement to reduce or limit services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Makes the per capita rate of payment for each class of HMO enrollee equal to the adjusted average per capita cost for that class, rather than 95 percent of such cost. Amends part B (Peer Review) of title XI of the Act to require peer review organizations (PROs) to give providers whose services are denied Medicare coverage an opportunity for reconsideration of the determination before patients and organizations responsible for paying claims are notified of such determination. Gives Medicare providers an opportunity, if appropriate, to pursue a recommended course of remedial education before PROs recommend their exclusion from such program by reason of their failure to comply with program requirements. Raises the threshold below which a county's population must fall for a provider located in such county to be entitled to a pre-exclusion hearing before an administrative law judge. Sets the civil monetary penalty for a provider's failure to comply with Medicare requirements at $2,500, rather than the cost of improperly provided services. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to maintain the current base Medicare payment rate for kidney dialysis treatment through September 1989. Requires that subsequent changes in such rate be subject to Medicare notice and comment requirements. Amends the Medicare program to prohibit payments for dialysis services from exceeding payments for such services determined pursuant to a method based on a single composite weighted formula. Increases the weighting factors, used in determining Medicare payments to hospitals for graduate medical education costs, for initial residencies in family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics. Offsets such increase by establishing a national payment limit for graduate medical education costs. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and distribute to Medicare beneficiaries a summary of recommended preventive health care practices and a form for use in recording information which might assist physicians in providing appropriate care. Part C: Other Provisions Relating to Medicare and Health-Related Programs - Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to provide that when a matter under part B (Peer Review) of such title or under the Medicare or Medicaid program is to be heard by an administrative law judge such judge must have been appointed by the Secretary exclusively for hearings on such matters. Amends the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 to make miscellaneous amendments affecting the United States Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, including the requirement that the Commission also be known as the Claude Pepper Commission and that it submit its two reports to the Congress concurrently by November 9, 1989. Amends title VII (Administration) of the Act to place the Office of Rural Health Policy under the direction of a Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Health responsible for reporting directly to the Secretary and Deputy Under Secretary of Health and Human Services. Makes such Office independent of other offices, services, and components of the Department of Health and Human Services. Elaborates upon the duties of the Office of Rural Health Policy. Expresses the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted in 1989 making receipt of the additional Medicare coverage provided by the Medicare Catastrophic Act of 1988 voluntary and imposing the additional premiums financing such coverage only on those who elect to receive such coverage. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Ways and Means review and hold hearings on the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. Subtitle B: Health Care Research and Policy - Part A: Agency for Health Care Research and Policy - Amends the Public Health Service Act to create a new title to establish, within the Public Health Service, the Agency for Health Care Research and Policy (Agency) to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services, through the establishment of a broad base of scientific research, and improvements in clinical practice and in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services.

Deducts child and medical care costs from the income eligibility test. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by July 1, 1990, on State error rates in determining the Medicaid eligibility of pregnant women and infants. Suspends error rate penalties attributable to such eligibility determinations made from July 1, 1989, until one year after the Secretary's report. Requires that States make ambulatory prenatal care available to a pregnant woman during a presumptive eligibility period which ends when she is determined to be ineligible for Medicaid benefits or after the month following the month during which she is determined to be eligible, if she fails to apply. Allows States to cover prenatal home visitation services for high-risk pregnant women and postpartum home visitation services for high-risk infants. Requires that States submit to the Secretary, by April 1 of each year, proposed Medicaid payment rates for obstetrical and pediatric services and such other data as will assist the Secretary in determining whether such rates are sufficient to ensure that obstetrical and pediatric services will be at least as available to Medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population. Requires States to immediately revise rates determined to be insufficient. Requires States to cover ambulatory services offered to pregnant women or children by certain federally-funded health centers. Excepts Medicaid-eligible pregnant women from required cooperation with States in establishing the paternity of children born out of wedlock. Requires States to: (1) coordinate Medicaid services with the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC) under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and (2) notify Medicaid-eligible pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum women and children under age five of WIC program benefits. Part B: Child Health Amendments - Requires States to: (1) provide Medicaid coverage to children born after September 30, 1983, whose family income is below the Federal poverty level; and (2) receive the Medicaid applications of pregnant women, infants, and children at locations which include locations other than those used under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Act. Allows States to offer an additional nine-, 12-, 15-, or 18-month period of Medicaid eligibility, rather than the additional six-month period, to families who lose AFDC eligibility because of increased earnings or employment hours, or a loss of earning exclusions and receive the initial six months of extended Medicaid coverage.

Part C: Community and Facility Habilitation Services Amendments - Medicaid Community and Facility Habilitation Services Amendments of 1989 - Subpart 1: Community Habilitation and Supportive Services - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to authorize States to cover community habilitation and supportive services for individuals with mental retardation or related conditions without regard to whether or not such individuals have been discharged from a nursing or habilitation facility. Defines community habilitation and supportive services as services which assist individuals in developing and maintaining the skills necessary to function successfully in a home or community-based setting. Requires that community habilitation and supportive services be provided to each client in accordance with an individual habilitation plan prepared and periodically reviewed and revised by an interdisciplinary team on the basis of a comprehensive functional assessment of a client's needs conducted before his or her receipt of services and at least annually thereafter. Requires that such services meet minimum requirements, to be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, regarding client rights and service quality. Makes the requirements imposed on habilitation facilities (under this Act) regarding patient's rights and facility safety and sanitation applicable to residential settings in which community habilitation and supportive services are provided. Requires that residential settings: (1) disclose persons having an ownership or control interest in the setting; and (2) exclude a person from such interest if he or she has been excluded from the Medicaid program or had an interest in a residential setting repeatedly found to have provided substandard care. Requires a habilitation facility which converts to a residential setting to continue to provide continuous active treatment to residents who required such treatment at the time of conversion. Requires a residential setting to document a client's receipt of medical services. Excludes settings in which fewer than three unrelated adults reside from the definition of a \"residential setting.\" Makes the: (1) Secretary responsible for certifying that State providers of community habilitation and supportive services and residential settings in which such services are provided comply with Medicaid requirements; and (2) States responsible for certifying that other providers of and residential settings for such services comply with Medicaid requirements. Requires each State to: (1) conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and clients in residential settings for community habilitation and supportive services regarding requirements imposed on such setting; and (2) provide, through the State agency responsible for the certification of such providers and residential settings, for the receipt, review, and investigation of allegations of client neglect and abuse and of misappropriation of client property by providers. Requires that such providers and settings be certified annually. Provides States with no Federal Medicaid coverage for the costs of carrying out such quality assurance activities. Authorizes States to reward providers of community habilitation and supportive services who provide the highest quality of care. Bases residential setting certification on an annual, unannounced survey. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a protocol for conducting surveys; and (2) conduct sample surveys of residential settings, within two months of State surveys, to test the adequacy of State surveys. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a special survey of a setting or a review of the provider when there is reason to question its compliance with this Act. Prohibits the use of surveyors who have an interest in the provider or setting being surveyed or have not completed a training and testing program approved by the Secretary. Requires States and the Secretary to investigate complaints against providers or settings concerning violations of this Act's requirements. Requires that: (1) certain information regarding providers and settings and their compliance with this Act's requirements be made available to the public; and (2) the State agency responsible for the protection and advocacy system for the developmentally disabled and the guardians of clients be notified of a provider's or setting's noncompliance with this Act's requirements. Gives State Medicaid fraud and abuse control units access to provider or setting survey and certification information. Requires that when the Secretary or State determines that a provider's or setting's deficiencies immediately jeopardize the client's health and safety, immediate action be taken to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies or the provider's or setting's participation in Medicaid be terminated. Directs the Secretary and States to apply certain other remedies where the health and safety of clients are not immediately jeopardized. Requires the imposition of civil money penalties against providers and settings which are, or are found to have been, out of compliance with any of this Act's requirements.
