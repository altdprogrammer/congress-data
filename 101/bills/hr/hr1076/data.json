    "text": "Permits the city of Chester, Illinois, to improve, repair, operate, and maintain an existing toll bridge across the Mississippi River near Chester (including the existing approaches to such bridge) in accordance with certain conditions. Permits the city to refund certain outstanding revenue bonds which had been originally issued to pay for the bridge construction costs. Confers rights upon the city of Chester to acquire land from certain sources for such bridge reconstruction and maintenance purposes. Permits the city to establish bridge tolls sufficient to cover certain bridge-related expenses, including a sinking fund to amortize bridge-related costs over a specified period. Requires the city to adjust the rates (or operate the toll bridge free) of tolls to be charged to provide a fund not to exceed the amount necessary to operate the bridge once the sinking fund is fully funded. Mandates that a public record of bridge-related costs be available for all interested persons."
