Establishes within the Department of Energy an Electric and Magnetic Fields Information Center to serve as a clearinghouse and center for dissemination of public information on the impact of electric and magnetic fields upon the public health. Establishes an Electric and Magnetic Fields Research Advisory Committee to: (1) suggest issues, research priorities and Federal funding levels for the work required by this Act; and (2) report annually to the Secretary and the Congress regarding the research program's status. Authorizes appropriations."
