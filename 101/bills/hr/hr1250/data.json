    "text": "Protect Our Children from Cigarettes Act of 1989 - Prohibits consumer sales promotion of any tobacco product if it is or may be seen or heard by any person under age 18. Excepts from this prohibition certain text-only advertisements which: (1) are placed in newspapers, magazines, and other publications and on signs or billboards not located in a sports stadium or other sports facility; and (2) are limited to specified information, including levels of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide. Sets forth the relationship of this Act to: (1) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority; and (2) State and local regulations. Prohibits vending machine sales of tobacco products in any place in which a person under 18 may lawfully enter. Requires conspicuous signs stating that cigarette sales to minors are strictly prohibited in any such places which have over-the-counter sales. Deems violations of the advertising and vending machine prohibitions violations of specified provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Allows civil actions for damages and other legal and equitable relief from such violations in appropriate State courts and Federal district courts. Requires awarding of legal fees to prevailing plaintiffs. Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to require the FTC to arrange for a continuous independent study of the constituents of tobacco smoke, and to report annually to the Congress on its results."
