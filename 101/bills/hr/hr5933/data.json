States that if the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (S. 566) is enacted before this Act, the above provisions shall be deemed to have taken effect immediately before its enactment. (This Act was signed into law October 31, 1990; the Cranston-Gonzalez Act was signed into law November 28, 1990.) Amends the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 to extend such Act through the earlier of November 30, 1990, or the enactment of S. 566. Extends through November 30, 1990, under specified conditions: (1) the Interagency Council on the Homeless; and (2) the Federal Housing Administration mortgage loan limit. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to allocate section 8 and public housing assistance so that each State shall receive annually at least one-half of one percent of the available funds for such programs."
