    "text": "Housing for the Frail Elderly Act of 1989 - Amends the Housing Act of 1959 to authorize FY 1990 appropriations (up to a certain number of units) for elderly or handicapped families' housing and related facilities assistance. States that such assistance shall be in the form of capital advances which shall not bear interest and not be required to be repaid as long as the housing remains available for elderly or handicapped families. (Current law provides assistance as interest-bearing loans.) Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into 20-year contracts to repay landlords for monthly operating costs in excess of project income for very low and lower income units. Includes among operating costs: (1) rent and utilities; (2) renovations and improvements to make units more accessible to elderly or handicapped persons; and (3) services such as meals, health and personal care, and management expenses to coordinate such activities. Terminates section 8 assistance (United States Housing Act of 1937) for projects receiving elderly and handicapped assistance as provided by this Act. Limits efficiency apartment rent in a project receiving such assistance to not more than 25 percent of a resident's monthly adjusted income. Encourages sponsors to adopt apartment design flexibility. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to provide technical assistance to train sponsors about the availability and acquisition of such assistance. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to permit funds to be used to provide services and service coordinators for elderly or handicapped residents in housing assisted under such Act. Limits such assistance to not more than 15 percent of service costs. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to provide similar assistance under: (1) the Housing Act of 1949 for rural rental housing; (2) the National Housing Act for low- and moderate-income housing; and (3) the United States Housing Act of 1937 for section 8 new construction. Directs the Secretary to maintain centralized waiting lists for elderly and handicapped housing."
