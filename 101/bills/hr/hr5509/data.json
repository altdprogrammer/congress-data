Establishes the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission to prepare a study of historically significant sites and structures associated with military action during the Civil War, other than Shenandoah Valley Civil War sites. Requires the Commission to transmit such study to the President and the same congressional committees. Terminates such Commission 180 days after transmittal of such report to the Congress.
