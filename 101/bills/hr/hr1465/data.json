    "text": "Oil Pollution Act of 1990 - Title I: Oil Pollution Liability and Compensation - Establishes the Oil Spill Compensation Fund. Makes the responsible party for a vessel or facility from which oil is discharged (or which poses a substantial threat of discharge) liable for removal costs and for economic or natural resource damages, including: (1) injury or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; (2) loss of use (including subsistence use) of natural resources; (3) loss or impairment of income, profits, or earning capacity; (4) loss of Federal and State tax, royalty, rental, or net profits share revenue; and (5) net costs of increased public services as a result of the discharge. Sets forth defenses to liability. Establishes liability limits for: (1) tankers; (2) other vessels; (3) onshore and offshore facilities; and (4) deepwater port facilities. Divides liability for an offshore mobile drilling unit into two parts: first as a tank vessel with respect to an oil discharge; and second as an offshore facility to the extent that damages and removal costs exceed the responsible party's statutory liability limits. Authorizes the President to establish lower liability limits for onshore facilities. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to study and report to the Congress on the relative operational and environmental risks of oil transportation by vessel to deepwater ports versus other ports. Requires the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to lower liability limits for deepwater ports if the study finds the risks are lower. Directs the President to report periodically to the Congress on the desirability of adjusting liability limits. Requires the periodic adjustment of liability limits to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index. Makes the responsible party liable for interest on the amount paid to settle a claim, with certain exceptions. Makes the President (or authorized representative of any State, Indian tribe, or foreign government) the trustee to act on behalf of the public to recover damages for injury to Federal, State, or foreign government natural resources. Requires the President, acting through specified Federal agencies, to promulgate regulations within two years of enactment of this Act for the assessment of damages for injury to natural resources resulting from an oil discharge. Sets forth guidelines for recovery by foreign claimants of removal costs and damages. Outlines circumstances under which the responsible party for a vessel or facility from which oil is discharged (or which threatens discharge) may recover removal costs and damages. Authorizes a civil action for contribution. Sets forth guidelines for indemnification agreements affecting responsible parties. Requires the President to consult with designated trustees regarding removal actions. Sets forth the uses for which the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (the Fund) may be obligated by Federal and State officials consistent with the National Contingency Plan. Authorizes the President to obligate the Fund for a maximum of $250,000 per discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil per incident per State. Directs the President to enter into agreements with a State to establish procedures under which a designated State official may receive payments from the Fund for removal costs consistent with the National Contingency Plan. Requires the President to promulgate regulations detailing the manner in which the Fund may be obligated. Sets forth a claims procedure. Provides for designation of a discharge source and advertisement of that fact and the pertinent claims procedure by the responsible party. Grants any person, including the Fund, subrogation rights for payments made for removal costs and damages. Provides that the Attorney General (upon request of the Secretary) shall commence an action against the responsible party to recover any costs paid from the Fund as a result of oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, including one from a foreign offshore unit. Requires the responsible party for certain-size vessels and offshore facilities to establish financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which such persons could be subjected under this Act. Provides for judicial review of regulations and actions under this Act. Grants State courts jurisdiction to hear cases under this Act, as well as under State law. Permits the States to impose additional liability or requirements regarding oil discharges within their borders. Retains the rights of the States to maintain a fund for oil pollution compensation. Authorizes States to enforce the financial responsibility requirements of this Act.
