Mandates that the obverse side of the one dollar coin have a design symbolizing the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus (thus replacing the Susan B. Anthony design). Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to cease regular production of one-dollar Federal Reserve notes by a specified date (except for such quantities as are required to meet collectors' needs). Mandates that the seigniorage of the new one-dollar coins be used to offset the reverse seigniorage resulting from the destruction of Susan B. Anthony dollar coins in Government storage."
