    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-05-23", 
    "text": "Public-Private Toll Road Act of 1990 - Revises Federal law regarding toll facilities to authorize States to impose tolls on any highway (not part of the Interstate system), bridge, or tunnel constructed or rehabilitated with Federal-aid highway funds without having to repay such funds to the Federal Government if the tolls are used for major reconstruction or reconstruction to expand capacity. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to permit Federal participation in: (1) construction of any new toll highway; and (2) major reconstruction to accommodate capacity problems of, and relieve congestion on, any existing highway which is tolled or which will be tolled upon the completion of such reconstruction. Limits the Federal share payable for the construction or reconstruction of any toll highway, bridge or tunnel to 35 percent. Specifies conditions under which a highway, bridge, or tunnel toll facility may be privately constructed or reconstructed and owned and operated. Requires States to agree (and provide in their regulation of the private operators of such tolled facilities) that the revenues derived from the operation of such a facility beyond those necessary for certain expenses incurred with respect to the facility will be used for highway purposes before the Secretary may authorize participation by the Federal Government. Authorizes State highway departments to continue to charge tolls on such a facility after the date of final payment of debt service of such facility if the tolls do not exceed the costs necessary for proper operation and maintenance of the facility."
