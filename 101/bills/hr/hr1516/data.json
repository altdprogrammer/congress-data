Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish notice that the National Institute is prepared to accept applications for assistance; and (2) negotiate a Memorandum stating the activities and responsibilities of each member of any joint venture selected for assistance. Requires each joint venture to submit an annual report and operating plan to the Secretary, the appropriate congressional committees, and the Comptroller General of the United States defining the goals, financial reporting requirements, and technology transfer agreements to be established in such joint venture. Treats all intellectual properties, trade secrets, and technical data developed by a joint venture receiving such assistance as if they are inventions made with Federal assistance for purposes of patent rights to such information. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994."
