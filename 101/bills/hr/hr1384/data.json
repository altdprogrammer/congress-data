    "text": "Declares that the Matagorda Island National Wildlife Refuge will consist of those areas and interests on Matagorda Island in Texas that were: (1) purchased by the Department of the Interior; and (2) returned to direct Federal management by the State of Texas. Sets forth the purposes of such Refuge, which include: (1) to protect and conserve threatened habitats and endangered species such as the whooping crane; (2) to conserve and enhance the fish and wildlife populations, including those of migratory waterfowl; and (3) to fulfill international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats. Requires that all such areas and interests be managed exclusively by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as an integrated unit of Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. Requires the Service Director to submit to the Congress a comprehensive management plan for the Matagorda Island National Wildlife Refuge. Requires that the Director conduct a comprehensive review of the management arrangement with the State of Texas concerning National Wildlife Refuge System lands and State lands on Matagorda Island State Park and study the desirability of direct Federal management of lands specified in the Memorandum of Agreement with Texas. Requires the Director to submit a report on such review and study to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of the Interior for management and facilities of the Refuge."
