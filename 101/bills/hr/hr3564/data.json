Prohibits the Administrator and the Governor from: (1) rescinding certain telephone loans without the borrower's consent; (2) regulating the order or sequence of advances of funds to any borrower under any combination of approved telephone loans from specified entities; or (3) denying a loan or advance to, or taking adverse action against, a telephone loan borrower for any reason not based on a published policy standard. Requires the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees on why certain loan applications have not been processed promptly.
