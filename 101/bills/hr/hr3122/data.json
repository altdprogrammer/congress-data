    "text": "Science and Technological Literacy Act of 1989 - Requires the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a program for supporting the development and dissemination of new curricula for mathematics and science at the elementary and secondary levels, and for mathematics, science, and engineering education and technical training at the undergraduate level, including through grants. Requires the NSF to establish a program to support the development and dissemination of innovative technologies for science and technological literacy instruction and training of individuals for technological careers, including through grants and through revolving fund loans. Requires an entity receiving funds for development of curricula or instruction technologies to obtain support of at least equal value from non-Federal sources. Allows the NSF Director to reduce or waive this requirement for an entity receiving funds for the acquisition of innovative computer hardware or software in certain circumstances. Requires the Director to carry out an advanced technician training program under which associate-degree-granting colleges will provide training in technical competencies in strategic fields. Requires an emphasis on: (1) collaborative programs with local employers; and (2) attracting people who are in need of retraining to retain jobs or who are unemployed. Provides for: (1) grants to such colleges; (2) establishment of an inventory of advanced technician training programs; (3) appointment of a National Advisory Council on Advanced Technician Training; (4) an annual report by the Council to the NSF and directly to the Congress without review by the NSF or the Office of Management and Budget; and (5) other matters. Requires the Director to designate ten centers of excellence among associate-degree-granting colleges to serve as national and regional clearinghouses, five for the benefit of colleges striving to upgrade their technical programs, five for the benefit of colleges and secondary schools striving to upgrade mathematics and science courses. Requires the colleges to pledge operating resources to match the Federal grants. Requires the Director to make at least 20 grants annually to associate-degree-granting colleges to develop and strengthen partnerships in mathematics and science education with secondary schools in the community. Requires the colleges to pledge operating resources to match the Federal grants. Sets forth the permissible uses of funds appropriated to carry out the centers of excellence and the partnerships provisions of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) curricula revision and instruction technologies for FY 1990; and (2) technician training for FY 1990 through 1992."
