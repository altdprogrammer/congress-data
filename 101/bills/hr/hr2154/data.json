Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a noncorporate taxpayer a tax deduction for capital gains equal to 55 percent of the lesser of: (1) the net capital gain; or (2) the net capital gain taking into account only sales and exchanges of qualified assets. Allows a 100 percent deduction (exclusion) when the taxpayer has an adjusted gross income of less than $20,000 and no alternative minimum tax is imposed. Sets forth a formula for determining the deduction for estates and trusts. Appropriates from the general fund of the Treasury to the account used to reduce the Federal deficit amounts equal to the sum of: (1) the increase in revenues under this Act; (2) the increase in revenues by reason of any amendment of the Internal Revenue Code after the date of enactment of this Act; and (3) amounts received from the sale of U.S. assets."
