    "text": "Camp W.G. Williams Land Exchange and Withdrawal Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to offer to exchange certain publicly owned lands for privately owned lands within Camp W.G. Williams, Utah. Withdraws Federal lands within the camp boundaries from all forms of settlement, sale, location, and entry under general land and mining laws, but not the mineral or geothermal leasing laws. Reserves such lands for use by the Department of the Army. Prescribes guidelines for additional Federal land acquisition. Revokes Executive Order 1922 of April 24, 1914, insofar as it affects lands within the camp boundaries. States that with respect to lands outside the camp boundaries such Executive Order is deemed revoked upon certification by the Secretary of the Army that such lands do not contain hazardous materials or substances. Confers liability upon the Department of the Army for any lands acquired pursuant to this Act. Divides land management responsibilities between the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior. Terminates the withdrawal and reservation status of such lands 15 years after enactment of this Act. Requires the appropriate military department Secretary to publish a draft environmental impact statement with respect to lands whose withdrawn status is sought to be renewed under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Army to notify the Secretary of the Interior by a specified deadline as to whether a continuing military need exists for the lands withdrawn under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Army to transmit a notice of renewal or relinquishment to the Secretary of the Interior by a specified deadline regarding the withdrawn lands. Mandates that a notice of intent to relinquish be preceded by the Secretary of Defense's written determination of such land's contaminated status. Prescribes procedures regarding the status of contaminated lands. Declares that this Act does not establish new Federal water reservation rights on the affected lands. Requires the Secretary of the Army to: (1) maintain an ongoing land decontamination program regarding the withdrawn lands; and (2) transmit a decontamination status report to certain congressional committees at the same time as the President's proposed fiscal year budget."
