(This makes any gas-related activities functionally related to the gas distribution business, thus meeting the requirements of such Act, regardless of whether the local distribution company involved is affiliated or unaffiliated with the holding company.) Requires, where the company whose interest is acquired is organized for gas-supply related activities, that: (1) the company proposing the acquisition must prove that it is in the interest of gas consumers; (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission must determine that such acquisition will not be detrimental to gas consumers; and (3) such determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis and shall not be based on any preset criteria."
