    "text": "Broadcast Radio Quality Improvements Act of 1989 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require, by January 1, 1992, that radio reception devices designed for consumer use that are imported or shipped in interstate commerce for sale and resale to the public be capable of: (1) receiving all broadcast radio frequencies; and (2) receiving stereophonic sound on the amplitude modulation broadcast band, if such device is capable of receiving such sound on such band. Provides for the enforcement of such provision. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in considering applications for radio licenses, to grant licenses which further locally oriented service and which will assure provision of interference-free radio service to the public. Prohibits the FCC from adopting a rule or policy which would generally increase interference on either the amplitude modulation or frequency modulation broadcast bands. Requires the FCC to adopt rules and policies which would reduce such types of interferences. Provides as one such rule or policy the voluntary reassignment of licensees of certain existing daytime-only amplitude modulation stations to the expanded amplitude modulation band. Outlines conditions for such reassigned broadcasting arrangements. Directs the FCC to conduct a study of, and report to the Congress on, the nonbroadcast sources of technical interference to the amplitude modulation broadcast band. Places certain limitations on the rebroadcasting by FM translator stations of the radio signals of local broadcast stations."
