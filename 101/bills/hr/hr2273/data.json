    "text": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 - Title I: Employment - Prohibits discrimination by a covered entity (any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee) against any qualified individual with a disability in job application procedures, hiring or discharge, compensation, advancement, training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. Lists actions construed to be discrimination. Allows: (1) actions that are job related and consistent with business necessity, if performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation; (2) a requirement that an individual not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace; (3) requirements that an individual be a member of and conform to the tenets of a religious entity employer; and (4) an employer to refuse to assign any employee with an infectious or communicable disease of public health significance to a food handling job, provided specified alternative employment is provided. Excludes from the term \"qualified individual with a disability\" an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs. Allows a covered entity to take specified actions with regard to the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol in relation to the workplace. Declares that, for this title, a test to determine illegal use of drugs is not a medical examination. Makes the remedies set forth in specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 available to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Attorney General, or any person alleging discrimination in violation of this Act. Title II: Public Services - Subtitle A: Prohibition Against Discrimination and Other Generally Applicable Provisions - Declares that no qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded from the participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination by a public entity (defined as a State, an agency, political subdivision, or other instrumentality of a State or States, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority as defined in the Rail Passenger Service Act). Makes the remedies and rights set forth in specified provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 available to any person alleging discrimination in violation of these provisions. Requires regulations under this subtitle: (1) subject to exception, to be consistent with certain coordination regulations applicable to recipients of Federal financial assistance under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and (2) to include standards for facilities and vehicles covered by this subtitle consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB). Subtitle B: Actions Applicable to Public Transportation Provided by Public Entities Considered Discriminatory - Part I: Public Transportation Other Than by Aircraft or Certain Rail Operations - Lists actions deemed to be discrimination with regard to: (1) public entities operating fixed route systems, with an exception for historic vehicles; (2) paratransit as a complement to fixed route service, with consideration given to undue financial burdens; and (3) public entities operating demand responsive systems. Allows the Secretary of Transportation, in certain circumstances, to temporarily relieve a public entity from the obligation to purchase new buses that are accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. Lists actions deemed to be discrimination with regard to construction of new facilities or alterations of existing facilities, with special rules for rapid rail and light rail key stations, including an extension of deadlines for extraordinarily expensive structural changes. Lists actions deemed to be discrimination with regard to public transportation programs and activities in existing facilities, with an exception for certain key stations. Requires one accessible car per train. Provides an exception for historic trains. Requires regulations under these provisions to include standards consistent with the minimum ATBCB guidelines and requirements. Part II: Public Transportation by Intercity and Commuter Rail - Lists actions deemed to be discrimination with regard to intercity and commuter rail. Requires one accessible car per train. Requires accessibility standards included in regulations under this part to be consistent with the ATBCB minimum guidelines.
