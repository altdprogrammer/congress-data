Requires claimants or parties in product liability actions, or anyone who anticipates being a claimant or party to such an action, to retain all material, documents, and other data that are relevant or may lead to the discovery of evidence relevant to that claim or action. Requires courts to: (1) order the relevant evidence to be conclusively established in a manner adverse to any party that willfully violates this Act; and (2) assess civil penalties and the other party's legal costs against manufacturers who commit such violations. Authorizes courts to establish a rebuttable presumption construing the relevant evidence in a manner adverse to any party who nonwillfully violates this Act."
