Exempts the same amounts from any general statutory budget limitation on Government outlays. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to: (1) include these same amounts in fiscal year total revenues and outlays for deficit calculation purposes; and (2) adjust the maximum deficit amount to reflect this new treatment of the affected trust funds. Makes it out of order in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, in the context of the congressional budget process, to consider changes or recommendations with respect to these trust funds."
