Requires that such experiments terminate by October 1, 1991. Directs OPM to review the experiments and report to the Congress on: (1) findings with respect to any additional costs or savings and effects on productivity, job satisfaction, and morale; and (2) recommendations for legislation or administrative action. Title II: Job-Sharing Program - Amends provisions relating to the establishment of part-time career employment programs to require OPM to establish a program to facilitate job-sharing arrangements in agencies. Requires OPM to serve as a clearinghouse on information for individuals seeking employment and positions to be filled under such arrangements. Requires OPM to provide notice of the program's availability to Government employees and applicants for Government employment."
