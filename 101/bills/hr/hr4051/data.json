    "text": "Social Security Telephone Access Act of 1990 - Amends title VII (Administration) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) maintain telephone access to local Social Security Administration (SSA) offices at the level of access generally available as of October 1, 1989; and (2) ensure that local telephone listings list the address and telephone number of each local SSA office and the SSA toll-free number, indicating that the local number is for information about a specified case or claim while the toll-free number is for general information. Directs the Secretary to establish one- to three-year demonstration projects implementing accountability procedures for at least three telephone service centers operated by the SSA. Requires that the Secretary promptly provide callers who give the Secretary specified identifying information with a written receipt which sets forth: (1) the name of the SSA representative with whom the caller spoke; (2) the date of the call; (3) a description of the nature of the call; (4) any action which the representative indicates will be taken in response to the call; and (5) the information or advice offered by the SSA representative. Requires that: (1) callers be notified that they will be provided with such receipt; and (2) the SSA retain a copy of such receipt. Authorizes the exclusion from such projects of routine calls unrelated to eligibility or benefits."
