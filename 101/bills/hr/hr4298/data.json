    "date": "1990-03-19", 
    "text": "Fair Campaign Practices Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for voluntary expenditure limitations and partial public financing for House of Representatives general elections. Sets forth eligibility requirements for public financing, including that a candidate: (1) has not and will not make expenditures or accept contributions in excess of specified limitations; (2) will deposit all payments in a separate checking account; (3) will furnish campaign records, evidence of contributions, and other appropriate information to the Federal Election (FEC); and (4) will cooperate in any audit and examination conducted by the FEC. Sets the voluntary expenditure limit at $400,000 with not more than ten percent coming from the personal funds of the candidate. Deems expenditures by a political committee of a political party to be expenditures subject to such limitation. Entitles an eligible candidate who has received at least $100,000 in contributions to payments matching the total amount of expenditures made by any other candidate in the election in excess of such limitation. Requires the FEC to certify the eligibility of a candidate for payments under this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain the House of Representatives Election Campaign Account in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund to make payments of certified amounts. Requires the FEC, after each general election, to audit ten percent of the eligible candidates by random selection. Requires the FEC to audit each eligible candidate after a special election. Requires candidates to repay the FEC for excess payments or expenditures. Provides for judicial review of FEC actions by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and for the participation. Directs the FEC to report to the House of Representatives after each election setting forth: (1) expenditures made by the candidates and their authorized committees; (2) its payments; (3) the amounts of any repayments; and (4) the balance in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and any account maintained in such Fund. Authorizes appropriations. Requires candidates for the House to report intended expenditures that would exceed voluntary limitations to the FEC. Requires individuals to report on intended independent expenditures advocating voting for or against a candidate to the FEC. Provides for the accountability of contributions made by intermediaries or conduits. Describes when an independent expenditure is not an independent expenditure if there is any type of arrangement, coordination, direction, advice, or counseling directly or indirectly between a candidate and the person making the expenditure. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the amount an individual may designate to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund from $1 to $2. Provides a tax credit of up to $50 for 50 percent of the contributions to House candidates. Disallows such credit for estates or trusts. Applies the limitations and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to certain payments to State or local committees of a political party excluded from the definition of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" under such Act (soft money). Prohibits State committees of a political party from making contributions to congressional candidates seeking election outside the State in which the committee is established."
