Excludes an expenditure if such person makes the expenditure because of information furnished by a candidate about his plans or needs and if at the time the candidate furnishes the information, he knows that such person intends to make the expenditure based on the information. Requires an advertisement on a television station or in a newspaper, magazine, billboard, mass mail, or other general public advertisement that is an independent expenditure to contain specified statements identifying it as an independent expenditure."
