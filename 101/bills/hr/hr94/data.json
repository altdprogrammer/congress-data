Establishes fire safety guidelines requiring that, in each public accommodation: (1) hard-wired, single-station smoke detectors be installed in each guest room in accordance with the appropriate American National Standard for Fire Alarm Systems; and (2) an automatic sprinkler system be installed in accordance with the appropriate American National Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, except in places that are three stories or lower. Authorizes the Director to take steps to encourage States to promote the use of automatic sprinkler and smoke detection systems and to disseminate information on the life safety value and use of such systems. Amends Federal law to limit the studies and surveys conducted to establish the lodging expenses of Federal employees on official business to public accommodations which meet fire safety guidelines. Prohibits the General Services Administration (GSA) from listing rates offered by places of public accommodation which do not meet such guidelines in any directory of lodging accommodations for Federal employees on official business. Requires that such directories include a description of the access and safety devices which each listed public accommodation provides for handicapped guests. Permits the GSA to take additional actions encouraging Federal employees to use public accommodations that meet fire safety guidelines. Sets forth minimum percentages (eventually reaching 90 percent) of total nights spent by agency employees on official business in public accommodations which must be spent in accommodations meeting fire safety guidelines. Prohibits Federal funding for meetings, conventions, conferences, or training seminars at public accommodations that do not meet fire safety guidelines. Protects the Federal Government from liability for damages resulting from the negligence of Federal employees in carrying out this Act's provisions. Prohibits this Act from being construed as encouraging the reduction of requirements for fire resistive walls or other safety features."
