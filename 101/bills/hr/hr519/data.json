    "text": "Amends Federal law to revise the formula used, in connection with Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holdings, to determine the amount of payments the Secretary of the Interior must make to local governments in lieu of taxes, permitting a payment option equal to three-fourths of one percent of the fair market value of the entitlement land, up to the amount that would be due if the land were subject to local property tax. Directs the Secretary, not later than July 1, 1990, and at least every five years thereafter, to appraise all entitlement lands to determine fair market value. Requires indexing of per acre formulas used to determine payments in lieu of taxes with respect to both BLM and National Wildlife Refuge System lands. Amends the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act to appropriate rather than authorize the appropriation of funds to the Refuge Revenue Sharing Fund whenever receipts are less than aggregate required payments. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to reduce payments (based on fair market value) in lieu of taxes in connection with National Wildlife Refuge System lands if the payments exceed amounts that would be due if the land were subject to local property tax."
