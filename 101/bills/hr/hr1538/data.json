Expands the use of the terms \"rural\" and \"rural area\" to include any area in the United States within 30 miles of the international border separating the United States from Mexico in which a substantial portion of the residents thereof lack water and sewage facilities. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Housing to make loans, grants, and combined loans and grants to eligible very-low income families or persons (including the nonelderly) in rural areas in the United States within 30 miles of the Mexican border for the cost of repairs, improvements, and additions to provide sanitary waste facilities and convenient and sanitary water supplies. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes."
