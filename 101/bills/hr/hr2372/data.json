Terminates the Fund 22 years after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth a claims procedure for individuals who submit written medical documentation that they incurred specified diseases as a result of such exposure (including childhood leukemia). Establishes a 20-year limitation of actions period and restricts the amount of attorney's fees which may be received. Insulates the award of damages from insurance claims or payments. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report on the incidence of radiation related to moderate or severe silicosis and pneumoconiosis in uranium miners employed in specified uranium mines located off Indian reservations."
