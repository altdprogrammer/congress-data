Directs the Secretary to: (1) review annually each State's method of financing its public elementary and secondary schools; and (2) certify all States in which public education funding meets equalized spending standards. Exempts from such funding prohibition any uncertified State which submits an approved plan for State compliance within five years of the notice of noncertification. Requires Federal funds allocated to a State prohibited from receiving them to be distributed to local education agencies within the State so that funding purposes may be carried out and equalized spending standards met. Title II: Fair Funding Among States - Authorizes appropriations for a program to assure a fair chance for a good education for children in all the States, contingent upon a certain level of appropriations for programs for education of disadvantaged children."
