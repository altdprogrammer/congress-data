Authorizes the Secretary to charge such agencies a fee for the analysis of security arrangements proposed by them. Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory committee with respect to the implementation of this Act. Limits the amount of loans, bonds, or securities that may be guaranteed to no more than $6,000,000,000. Title II: Guaranteed Securities Exempt From Restriction on Tax Exemption for Federally Guaranteed Bonds - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude bonds guaranteed under this Act from the restriction on tax exemption for federally guaranteed bonds (thus making the interest on such bonds tax-exempt)."
