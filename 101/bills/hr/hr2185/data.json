    "text": "Child Welfare and Foster Care Amendments of 1989 - Title I: Provisions Relating to Older Children in Foster Care Independent Living Program - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to authorize States to continue foster care payments for children under age 21 who are participating in an independent living program but have exceeded the age limit (age 18 or, for full-time secondary school students, 19) for such payments. Extends, indefinitely, Federal funding for State programs to assist children who have attained age 16 in making the transition from foster care to independent living. Title II: Health Care Plans for Foster Care Children - Requires that: (1) the written case plan developed for each foster care child include a health care record and plan for each child indicating how the child's health care needs have been and are being met; and (2) foster care children who are under a State's responsibility and not covered under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act receive comprehensive health assessments comparable to those required under the Medicaid early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment program. Reimburses States for a percentage of assessment costs equal to the Medicaid Federal assistance percentage. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) develop and disseminate foster children health care standards; and (2) provide technical assistance to foster care agencies and providers to ensure the development and management of health care plans and records for foster children and the adequate provision of health care assessments and services to such children. Title III: Training and Compensation of Foster Care Parents, Staff, and Providers - Directs States to require foster parents and staff members of child-care institutions to satisfactorily participate in training designed to familiarize them with the special needs and problems of foster children. Requires States to develop specific training and retraining requirements and provide free child care services to foster parents who are receiving such training. Covers 75 percent of State costs of providing such training and child care. Requires that in conducting periodic reviews of foster care payment amounts States give full consideration to increases in the cost of providing foster care and the costs relating to the care of children with extraordinary physical or mental health care needs. Directs the Secretary to periodically (at least biennially) collect information on each State's level of foster care payments and distribute such information to all States. Title IV: Increase in Authorization for Child Welfare Services under Title IV - B of the Social Security Act and Extension of Transfer of Funds Provisions - Amends part B (Child Welfare Services) of title IV of the Act to increase authorized appropriations under such program. Amends the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program to extend through FY 1991: (1) the ceiling on Federal payments to States for foster care expenditures; and (2) the authority for States to use such payments to cover expenditures under part B (Child Welfare Services) of title IV of the Act. (Currently, such ceiling and authorization runs through FY 1989.) Title V: Effective Date - Makes this Act's amendments effective on October 1, 1989, unless otherwise specified."
