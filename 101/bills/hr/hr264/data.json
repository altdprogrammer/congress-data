Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1993. Allows the use of grant funds, among other purposes, for: (1) model cooperative programs applying private and nonprofit sector resources to elementary and secondary schools; (2) projects to encourage business and other alliance participants to work with educationally disadvantaged and with gifted students; (3) projects to enrich the career awareness of secondary school students; (4) special staff training projects; (5) academic internship programs; and (6) tutorial and volunteer work in such schools by personnel assigned from business concerns and other alliance participants. Establishes an Alliance for Education Board within the Department of Education. Sets forth grant application criteria, including assurances of a non-Federal share and continuation of activities after the grant period. Sets forth: (1) application approval requirements; (2) requirements for a declining Federal share of costs; and (3) evaluation and dissemination requirements."
