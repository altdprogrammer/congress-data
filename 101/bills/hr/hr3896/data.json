Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise grants to States for employment security administration. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to increase the wage base for the Federal unemployment tax. Amends SSA to require the Secretary to report annually on the condition of each account in the Unemployment Trust Fund, with a five-year projection for each such account. Amends IRC to require State agencies to approve specified types of education and retraining for long-term unemployment compensation recipients. Amends FSEUCA to require certain extended unemployment benefit recipients to participate in training programs. Repeals certain limitations on the payment of unemployment compensation to former members of the armed forces under specified Federal law. Exempts from any order issued under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) for FY 1992 or any succeeding fiscal year: (1) extended unemployment compensation program payments to States under FSEUCA: (2) employment security administration payments to States under SSA; and (3) railroad unemployment compensation program payments under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act."
