    "text": "Medicare Trauma Care and Emergency Services Quality Assurance Act of 1989 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require each State to develop a statewide trauma and emergency medical services plan which: (1) provides for the designation of hospitals as level I, level II, or level III trauma centers; (2) establishes standards for the prehospital care and emergency transport of trauma patients; and (3) sets forth guidelines for the transfer of patients to trauma centers. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States for the development and implementation of such plans. Covers 40 percent of State expenditures on such plans, but limits State allotments to five cents multiplied by the number of State residents. Requires the Secretary to conduct a study and report to the Congress by March 1, 1991, on the adequacy of Medicare payments for trauma discharges."
