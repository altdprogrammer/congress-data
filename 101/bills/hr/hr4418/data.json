    "text": "Veterans' Compensation Amendments of 1990 - Title I: Compensation Rate Increases - Increases the rates of: (1) veterans' disability compensation; (2) additional compensation for veterans' dependents; (3) the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans; (4) dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children; and (5) supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation for disabled adult children. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adjust administratively the rates of disability compensation payable to persons who are not in receipt of compensation for service-connected disability or death. Title II: Miscellaneous Program Amendments - Increases from three to six months the period during which a veteran having neither spouse nor child and being furnished domiciliary care by the Department of Veterans Affairs will be paid a monthly pension by the Secretary. Requires that any amount of pension being withheld from a veteran due to the provision of domiciliary or nursing home care by the Department shall be paid in a lump sum after the veteran's discharge or release. Limits such payment to $5,000. Provides that in order to continue to receive payments of pension, compensation, or emergency officers' retirement pay after being rated incompetent, a veteran receiving Government hospital treatment or domiciliary care may not have an estate the value of which exceeds $4,500 (currently, $1,500). Authorizes the Secretary to accept gifts, devises, and bequests which enhance the Secretary's ability to provide services or benefits. Allows the payment of parents' dependency and indemnity compensation less frequently than monthly if the amount of the annual benefit is less than four percent of the maximum annual rate payable."
