Provides that the verification requirement that the Data Integrity Board must determine that there is a high degree of confidence that the information provided to the recipient agency is accurate shall not apply to aid to families with dependent children, Medicaid, and food stamp programs until the earlier of: (1) the date on which the appropriate Board which administers that program determines that there is not a high degree of confidence that information provided by that agency is accurate; or (2) 30 days after the guidance issued by the OMB Director is published."
