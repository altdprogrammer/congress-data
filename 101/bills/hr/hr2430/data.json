    "text": "Amends the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring operators of pipeline facilities to: (1) assess periodically the integrity of all such facilities through hydrostatic testing or other methods; or (2) reduce their maximum operating pressure to a level that ensures an appropriate margin of safety. Requires the assessment within one year after enactment of this Act of all pipeline facilities constructed of pipe manufactured by electric resistance weld process before April 1, 1970, which have not previously been hydrostatically tested. Requires that pipeline facilities operators be trained to recognize and react appropriately to abnormal operating conditions (including spills) which may indicate a dangerous situation. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on advanced hazardous liquid pipeline facility leak detection equipment and techniques."
