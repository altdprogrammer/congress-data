    "text": "Alternate Fuels Transit Act of 1989 - Mandates that any new bus or new bus engine acquired after October 1, 1991, with Federal assistance for mass transportation operation predominantly in a nonattainment area (as defined under the Clean Air Act for ozone or any mobile-source pollutant) be operated exclusively on alcohol, natural gas, or LP gas. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide States with supplemental grants equal to 50 percent of the amount by which bus acquisition costs exceed the acquisition cost of a comparable diesel-fueled bus. Limits the number of buses covered by such grants to 1,000. Authorizes the Secretary to provide States with a supplemental grant for the purchase and installation of facilities to provide alcohol, natural gas, or LP-gas for such bus. Cites circumstances under which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may delay or suspend implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years after FY 1991."
