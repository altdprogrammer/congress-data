Permits preschools to receive exemplary grants for education of the homeless and extends the authorization of appropriations for such grants. Establishes a program of demonstration grants for educational success. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make such grants to State and local educational agencies (LEAs) for support services for homeless children and youths to ensure their successful education in preschools and elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide support and technical assistance to State educational agencies to carry out their responsibilities; and (2) determine whether State laws, regulations, policies, and practices described in their plans adequately address the educational problems of homeless children and youths. Requires that comprehensive homeless assistance plans include: (1) certain information relating to homeless school-aged children and youths; and (2) an assurance that welfare authorities and other agencies responsible for placing homeless families in temporary accommodations will consider the need to minimize disruption of the education of the children or youths."
