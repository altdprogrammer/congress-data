Sets forth the smoking-related medical costs for the three-year period beginning after December 31, 1990. Declares the costs for the three-year period beginning after December 31, 1993, to be the amount determined to be equal to: (1) the average annual amount estimated to have been expended for the care and treatment of smoking-related cancers, circulatory system diseases, and respiratory diseases under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare); and (2) the average annual amount of estimated expenditures under title XIX of such Act (Medicaid) for such cancers and diseases. Appropriates a portion of increased cigarette tax revenues to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under the Medicare program for smoking-related medical costs. Authorizes appropriations of a portion of such revenues to the Medicaid program for such costs."
