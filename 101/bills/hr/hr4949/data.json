Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992 to reimburse the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the cost of providing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with weather reporting services. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to authorize the Administrator of the FAA to make grants to colleges, universities, and nonprofit research organizations to: (1) conduct aviation research; and (2) establish a research consortium, consisting of regional centers for continuing research with respect to civil aviation. Requires the Administrator to make an annual report to specified congressional committees with regard to such research grant program. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on the advisability of granting to the Administrator specific leasing and multiyear contracting authority for the purchase of real property and goods and services. Authorizes the FAA to award contracts pursuant to research grants under Buy American requirements to U.S. firms. Requires the Administration to report to the Congress regarding such contracts."
