    "text": "Youth Apprenticeship Act of 1990 - Establishes an Institute for Youth Apprenticeship (the Institute) as an independent establishment to administer youth apprenticeship programs set up under this Act. Directs the Institute Board of Directors to study youth apprenticeship programs; and (2) report findings and conclusions to the Secretaries of Labor and of Education and the appropriate congressional committees. Directs the Board Chairperson to establish guidelines, criteria, and procedures for youth apprenticeship programs, based on such report, including curriculum guidelines, criteria for demonstration program sites and for apprenticeship occupations, and competency criteria and certification procedures for apprentices and trainers. Directs the Institute Executive Director to enter into contracts with public and nonprofit private organizations to develop and evaluate youth apprenticeship demonstration programs that establish partnerships between schools and employers. Requires each eligible entity entering into such a contract to establish partnerships between secondary and postsecondary schools and employers to provide apprenticeship training to students. Allows an entity to incorporate into the partnership representatives of organized labor, employment and training agencies, and State education and labor departments. Makes such partnerships responsible for program and curriculum development, coordination and quality assurances, and assessment and evaluation of apprentices and training programs. Sets forth requirements for partnership training for various levels of secondary school students and for postsecondary students and current workers. Sets forth requirements for employers to pay: (1) up to 100 percent of the apprentice's stipend, depending on the secondary school program level; (2) wages and employee benefits for apprentices in postsecondary programs; and (3) costs of on-the-job training. States that employers shall not be required to hire apprentices upon completion of the apprenticeships. Requires participating schools to make in-kind contributions and to allocate resources to meet new demands as young people become more involved in apprenticeship during school. Directs the Institute to coordinate programs by: (1) providing technical assistance to partnerships; (2) operating an apprenticeship clearinghouse for the partnerships; (3) disseminating model programs and practices to the partnerships; and (4) gathering input from all sources on proposals for the labor mobility of apprentices. Authorizes appropriations. Abolishes the Board and Institute, terminates all programs established by this Act, and repeals this Act and the amendments it makes not later than 69 months after the initiation of the youth apprenticeship demonstration programs."
