    "text": "Government Procurement Agreements Act of 1990 - Amends the Buy American Act to prohibit executive agency heads from negotiating, entering into, modifying, renewing, or extending any agreement with a foreign government for the procurement of an item manufactured outside the United States, except for any procurement conducted pursuant to the Agreement on Government Procurement (the Agreement), unless that particular action is authorized by statute and the agreement is for a fixed term. Requires executive agencies, in negotiating such agreements with a foreign government, to seek to: (1) establish audit standards and practices for procurements conducted under the agreement; (2) establish transparent, competitive, and open procedures for such procurements; and (3) increase access to foreign markets for U.S. product sectors not covered by such agreements or the Agreement. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should seek to negotiate with foreign governments the dates by which certain indefinite term agreements to procure equipment will terminate."
