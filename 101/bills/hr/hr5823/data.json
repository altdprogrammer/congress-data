    "text": "Andean Trade Preference Act of 1990 - Authorizes the President to grant duty-free treatment to eligible articles from an Andean beneficiary country. Sets forth factors the President must take into account in determining whether to designate a country a beneficiary country, limited to a choice of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. Requires goods imported from a U.S. insular possession to receive duty treatment no less favorable than the treatment afforded such goods imported from a beneficiary country. Authorizes the President to withdraw or suspend the designation of a country as a beneficiary country or the application of duty-free treatment to a product if circumstances have changed to bar such designation. Sets forth criteria with respect to the eligibility for duty-free treatment of products manufactured in a beneficiary country. Declares that duty-free treatment shall not apply to: (1) textile and apparel articles which are subject to textile agreements; (2) footwear not designated as eligible under the General System of Preferences; (3) tuna in airtight containers; (4) petroleum; (5) certain watches; (6) certain articles which are subject to reduced rates of duty; or (7) certain sugars, syrups, and molasses. Requires the President to reduce duty rates on handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel that: (1) are the product of a beneficiary country; and (2) were not designated on August 5, 1983, as eligible articles under the General System of Preferences. Authorizes filing of a petition with the Secretary of Agriculture with a request for emergency relief regarding a perishable product if it has already been filed with the International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging injury from imports from a beneficiary country. Authorizes the President to withdraw duty-free treatment with respect to such products after the Secretary's recommendation to take emergency action under this Act. Makes conforming amendments to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Requires the ITC to report to the Congress on the economic impact of this Act on U.S. industries and consumers. Requires the Secretary of Labor to review and analyze the impact of this Act on U.S. labor."
