    "text": "Consumer Seafood Safety Act of 1989 - Prohibits: (1) processing or selling any fish or fishery product deemed adulterated under this Act; (2) refusal to permit inspection of a vessel or establishment, or otherwise interfering with any person in carrying out duties under this Act; (3) unauthorized reproduction, alteration, or destruction of any official stamp or certificate; (4) keeping false records or destruction of required records; (5) processing fish without a certificate issued by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary); and (6) importing fish or fishery products which fail to comply with all the inspection, good processing practice, and other provisions of this Act. Prescribes fines for commission of any of such prohibited acts. Authorizes the Secretary to refuse to provide inspection services to protect the public health, curb persistent violations or enforce the other provisions of this Act. Makes any person who intentionally adulterates fish or fishery products guilty of a felony and sets forth imprisonment requirements. Deems fish or fishery products adulterated if they: (1) contain any substance hazardous to human health; (2) have not been processed in accordance with provisions of this Act; (3) are made from shellfish harvested in a growing area determined to contain substances that will cause each shellfish to be injurious to health; and (4) are imported from a country that does not use a fish safety program approved by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to identify the chemical and microbiological contaminants, parasites, and toxins which are most likely to be found in fish and fish products and cause fish or fish products to be unsafe for human consumption. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) prescribe standards of sanitation and other good processing, storage, and handling for each stage of the processing of fish and fishery products; (2) issue a certificate which requires proof of sanitation and storage facilities on an establishment or vessel and implementation of a quality assurance program approved by the Secretary; and (3) prescribe standards for identifying and marking fish or fishery products with an official stamp available only for fish and fishery products processed at all stages by certified establishments or vessels. Sets forth the circumstances in which a certificate may be suspended. Allows a holder of a suspended certificate to submit a new certification application at any time. Provides for inspection of each establishment or vessel where fish or fishery products are processed for interstate commerce. Authorizes the Secretary to direct that any labeling or packaging of fish or fishery products which the Secretary has reason to believe is false or misleading be withheld and that any otherwise authorized official mark not be used. Directs the Secretary to publish regulations regarding records describing all activities relevant to food safety and sanitation, with the records available for public inspection. Allows the Secretary, when the Secretary determines that the inspection system of any foreign country is at least equal to the provisions of this Act, to accept certain certificates as compliance with the requirements of this Act. Prohibits any employer from discriminating against any employee because the employee has assisted in the carrying out of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish priorities for fish and fish products safety research; and (2) design and implement a national program for fish and fish products safety education. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
