    "text": "District of Columbia Judicial Reorganization Act of 1989 - Title I: Supreme Court of the District of Columbia - Amends the District of Columbia Code to establish the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (Court) consisting of a chief justice and six associate justices with jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that meet specified criteria. Allows the Court, at its discretion, to certify a case for review before it has been determined by the D.C. Court of Appeals, but only under limited circumstances described in this Act. Allows the Court to: (1) answer questions of law certified to it by the U.S. Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals of the United States, or the highest court of any State, if a question of D.C. law may be determinative of the case pending in the certifying court; and (2) order the certification of a question of law of another State to the highest court of such State. Provides for the temporary assignment of Court judges to and from other D.C. courts. Directs the chief justice of the Court to annually summon the active judges of the D.C. courts to a Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia for the purpose of advising as to means of improving the administration of justice within the District of Columbia. Authorizes appropriations to the District of Columbia for FY 1991 through 1996 for the establishment of the Court. Title II: Judges of the District of Columbia Courts - Reduces the tenure of D.C. court judges from 15 to ten years. Makes the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission, rather than the President, responsible for designating the chief judge of a D.C. court. Increases the number of associate judges of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia from 50 to 58. Title III: Judicial Magistrates - Replaces the hearing commissioners of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia with judicial magistrates who shall be appointed by the Judicial Magistrate Selection Commission from among individuals recommended by the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission. Authorizes a judicial magistrate, when specifically designated by the chief judge of the Superior Court, to make findings and enter final orders or judgments which shall constitute final orders of the Superior Court. Title IV: Judicial Nomination Commission and Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure - Increases the number of members of the District of Columbia Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure from five to nine. Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to increase the number of members of the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission from seven to nine. Title V: Citizens Advisory Committee on the Judicial System of the District of Columbia - Establishes a Citizens Advisory Committee on the Judicial System of the District of Columbia which shall advise the Congress, the Mayor, and the Council of the District of Columbia concerning the fairness and efficiency of the D.C. courts and judicial system."
