    "text": "Farm Poundage Quota Revisions Act of 1990 - Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to permit the sale of a farm's burley tobacco (burley) quota to another active burley tobacco producer in the same county under specified conditions. Postpones the effective date of the loss of quota for underplanting provisions until the 1994 marketing year. (Current law makes such provisions effective as of the 1976 marketing year.) Bases such determination on two of the three previous years' plantings. (Current law is determined on the previous five years' plantings.) States that when a farm is divided through reconstitution (other than through probate or among family members) the burley tobacco poundage quota which transfers with the divided land shall be at least 1000 pounds. Increases lease limitations from 15,000 pounds to 30,000 pounds. Authorizes the lease and transfer of burley quotas between any two farms within Tennessee or Virginia if a majority of active burley producers within the respective State so approves in a statewide referendum."
