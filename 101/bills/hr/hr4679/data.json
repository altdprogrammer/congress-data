Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, beginning with the 1991 crop year, to make disaster payments available to producers of commodities for which Federal crop insurance was available during the 1990 crop year and to producers of hay and forage crops. Bases eligibility upon county average yield compared with normal county yield. Makes a person with annual gross revenue in excess of $2,000,000 ineligible for payments. Prohibits payments to the extent that a producer receives emergency livestock or emergency loan benefits for the same production losses."
