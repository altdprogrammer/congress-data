Permits an income tax deduction (both individual and corporate) for radon prevention expenditures in connection with real property development, building construction or enlargement, and certain relocation dwellings. Makes the tax credit and the tax deduction mutually exclusive with respect to the same expenditures. Amends Federal law to make funds available for the reimbursement of Federal employees for radon protection expenditures necessary to overcome a substantial obstacle to the salability of a principal residence being sold in conjunction with a transfer to a new location."
