Requires the Secretary, with respect to the 1989 crop year, to determine the impact on producers and commodity programs of alternative methods of determining payment yields for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice, including: (1) using producers' actual yields for the current crop year; (2) allowing producers the option to use actual yields or county average yields; and (3) five-year yield averaging.
