Requires the Secretary to assess the extent to which the planning and management of such Forest has differed from the planning and management of other national forests. Repeals a provision authorizing an annual appropriation for the maintenance of the timber supply from such Forest. Repeals a provision in order to require the Secretary of Agriculture to identify lands unsuitable for timber production in the development of land management plans for the Tongass National Forest timber utilization program. Requires that the Secretary's annual report on the adequacy of the timber supply in southeastern Alaska be submitted to the House Committee on Agriculture in addition to other specified committees. Requires that the Secretary's two-year report to the Congress on the status of such Forest include the impact of timber management on the subsistence resources, wildlife, and fisheries habitats in that Forest. Requires that the study of Tongass National Forest timber supply and demand be conducted in cooperation and consultation with the Southeast Alaska commercial fishing industry in addition to other specified organizations and the southeast Alaska timber industry."
