Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the operation of a tank vessel or a vessel greater than 50 meters in length in a certain Area to Be Avoided (ATBA). Provides that no leasing, exploration, development, or production of minerals or hydrocarbons shall be permitted within the Sanctuary. Requires the Secretary to develop a comprehensive management plan and implementing regulations. Terminates, upon the enactment of this Act, all congressionally mandated studies of existing areas in the Florida Keys for designation as National Marine Sanctuaries. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Governor of Florida to develop a comprehensive water quality protection program for the Sanctuary. Excludes such program from the comprehensive management plan if it does not meet the purpose for which the Sanctuary is designated or is otherwise inconsistent or incompatible with it. Requires the Secretary to establish an Advisory Council to assist with the comprehensive management plan. Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the future requirements for funding the Sanctuary."
