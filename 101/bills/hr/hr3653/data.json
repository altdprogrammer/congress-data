Amends the Supplemental Appropriations and Rescission Act, 1980 to provide a temporary waiver of reimbursement by the Virgin Islands of customs collection costs. Authorizes the use of surplus amounts in the account of Puerto Rico in the Unemployment Trust Fund for: (1) projects relating to the repair or replacement of property damaged by Hugo; and (2) public service employment related to disaster reconstruction in areas in which private sector employment and training opportunities have been reduced or eliminated as a result of Hugo."
