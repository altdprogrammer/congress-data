Specifies that: (1) such treatment plant shall be designed and constructed to treat the quantity and quality of effluent historically discharged from such Tunnel and to meet requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; and (2) design, construction, operation, and maintenance costs of the works authorized by this Act shall be nonreimbursable. Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit the plans for design and operation of the works to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Colorado prior to initiation of construction in order to obtain their views; and (2) notify the Congress that the discharge will meet specified standards. Makes the Secretary responsible for the operation, maintenance, and replacement of the water treatment plant. Authorizes the Secretary to formulate and implement a program for the restoration of fish and wildlife resources of those portions of the Arkansas River basin affected by the effluent discharged from the Tunnel. Requires the Secretary to submit a copy of the proposed program to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
