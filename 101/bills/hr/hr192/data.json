Title II: Permanent Authorization for White House Conferences on Small Business - Directs the President to conduct a National White House Conference on Small Business once during each four-year period following a presidential election to increase public awareness of the role of small businesses and to review the status of recommendations adopted at the next preceding White House Conference on Small Business.

Requires the Small Business Administration to report annually to the Congress during the three-year period following the Conference report on the status and implementation of Conference recommendations. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Judicial Review Under Regulatory Flexibility Act - Amends the Regulatory Flexibility Act to repeal the proscription against judicial review of agency determinations regarding regulatory flexibility. Title IV: Regulatory Analysis of Tax Interpretative Rules - Amends the Regulatory Flexibility Act to make an interpretative rule issued under the Internal Revenue Code an agency rule subject to such Act. Title V: Study of Impact of Regulatory Analysis Upon Small Business - Requires the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to study the impact of Federal regulatory paperwork and tax requirements upon small business. Title VI: Study of Credit Availability - Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to study the availability of credit to small business."
