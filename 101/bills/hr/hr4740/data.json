Makes it unlawful to import any tuna product caught with equipment which involves the taking of dolphins. Declares that the Congress urges: (1) preparation by the United Nations of an international convention to ensure proper and effective conservation of dolphins stocks; and (2) renegotiation of treaties to increase the limit on the number of boats from the United States which may engage in the taking of tuna."
