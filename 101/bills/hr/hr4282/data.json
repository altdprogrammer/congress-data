    "text": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to limit multicandidate political committee contributions to $5,000 for any candidate for the House of Representatives and the candidate's authorized political committees. Requires any person to report to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) within 24 hours after making independent expenditures exceeding $5,000 with respect to such a candidate. Requires the FEC to notify the candidate of such expenditures. Provides for the accountability of contributions made by intermediaries or conduits. Permits candidates for the House to submit to the FEC an affidavit of agreement to limit their expenditures to $500,000 in a contested election. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits of up to $200 for contributions to House candidates by residents of the congressional district involved. Disallows such tax credits for estates and trusts. Limits aggregate contributions by an individual resident to a candidate for the House in the congressional district involved and the candidate's authorized political committee to $3,000. Requires candidates for the House who violate a voluntary expenditure limitation to: (1) notify contributors that they are no longer eligible for income tax credits for campaign contributions; and (2) return individual resident contributions aggregating in excess of $2,000. Sets forth monetary penalties for violations of voluntary expenditure limitations. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to limit the charges for broadcasts by candidates for public office within specified periods before primary, general, or special elections to: (1) the normal and usual unit charges (currently, the lowest unit charge) for the time involved; or (2) 70 percent of that amount for House candidates who have agreed to voluntary campaign expenditure limitations."
