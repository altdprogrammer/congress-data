Directs the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Interior setting forth the methods by which the Secretary of the Interior will assist in accomplishing the purposes of this Act. Requires the President's proposed budget to the Congress to specifically identify funds to be spent on such research. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to administer an Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico to: (1) conduct long-term studies that include the designation and management of units that protect tropical forests, the relationship between the atmosphere and such forests, sustainable economic development and regeneration and restoration of such forests, and the effects of deforestation on various environmental and economic factors; and (2) provide assistance that includes technology transfer from such studies, the training of foreign researchers, and the promotion of research by other institutions. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to manage the Caribbean National Forest (also known as the Luquillo Experimental Forest) as a model of tropical forest management for use in international outreach, study, training, and research. Requires the Secretary to construct the necessary training and educational facilities in such forest. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to administer an Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry in Hawaii to: (1) conduct long-term studies to include methods for slowing or reversing tropical deforestation on Pacific Ocean islands and monitoring global and atmospheric change and protecting wildlife on such islands; and (2) conduct an international outreach program that includes sharing the products and findings of such research with others throughout the tropics. Authorizes the Secretary to provide international assistance, without reimbursement, to carry out this Act. Prohibits such assistance to countries ineligible to receive development assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Extension Service Program - Requires the Secretary to direct the Extension Service to conduct a program to catalogue all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations that govern the disposal of unused or unwanted agricultural chemicals and chemical containers. Makes educational materials developed or collected by the program available to the public."
