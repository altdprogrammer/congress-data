Establishes a ten fiscal year (beginning with FY 1991) priority for immigrants from countries adversely affected by Public Law 89-236 and from other underrepresented countries. Establishes a preference immigration point system based on: (1) age; (2) occupational demand; (3) occupational training and work experience; (4) prearranged U.S. employment; (5) education; and (6) knowledge of U.S. government and history. Reduces the naturalization waiting period from five years to three years. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on the immigration impact of this Act."
