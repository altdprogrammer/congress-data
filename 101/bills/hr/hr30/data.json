    "text": "Act for Better Child Care Services of 1989 - Amends the State Dependent Care Development Grants Act (subchapter D of chapter 8 of subtitle A of title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981) to provide for a Federal program for the improvement of child care and to retitle such Act as the State Child Care Development Grants Act of 1989. Sets forth a formula for allotments to States based on numbers of children under age five, numbers of children eligible for free or reduced price lunches under the school lunch program, and per capita income. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make grants to applicant Indian tribes or tribal organizations for programs and activities under this Act for the benefit of Indian children. Requires the chief executive officer of a State to designate an appropriate State lead agency. Requires the agency to establish several local advisory councils that collectively represent the entire geographical area in the State. Requires States to submit to the Secretary, in order to qualify for assistance under this Act, an application and five-year plan. Requires the plan to set forth procedures designed to ensure that: (1) the parents of children who will receive assisted child care services are permitted to select the eligible child care provider; (2) the State will attempt to place such child with such provider; and (3) each eligible child care provider will provide service to a reasonable mix of children, including those from different socioeconomic backgrounds and those with a handicapping condition. Requires the plan to specify that at least 75 percent of the State allotment will be used to provide qualified child care services to eligible children, on a sliding fee scale basis (according to specified funding methods), with priority given to services to children of families with very low incomes. Requires that at least ten percent of such reserved funds be used to provide for the extension of part-day programs. Requires the plan to make ineligible for assistance under this Act child care providers who are convicted, or who employ as providers of child care services persons convicted of specified Federal and State offenses involving sexual contact with individuals under age 16 or the production or advertisement of child pornography. Sets forth special rules for use of State allotments. Requires that child care services be provided by: (1) contracts with or grants to eligible child care providers for direct services; (2) grants to local governments to contract with direct providers; or (3) child care certificates distributed to parents of eligible children to enable them to purchase such services from such providers. Prohibits financial assistance under this Act from being expended for the construction of any new facility, and sets forth limitations on such assistance for renovation or repair of existing facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to make planning grants, in the first year of their program participation, to States which desire to participate under this Act but cannot fully satisfy the requirements of a State plan without financial assistance. Requires States receiving funds to recognize and assist private nonprofit community-based organizations, public organizations, local governments, or public agencies representing combinations of local governments, as resource and referral agencies for particular areas. Requires resource and referral programs to: (1) identify existing child care services; (2) inform and refer parents to such services; (3) provide for information, training, and technical assistance to existing and potential providers; and (4) provide information on supply of and demand for such services in a community. Requires each participating State to require that all employed or self-employed persons providing licensed or regulated child care complete at least 15 hours per year of specified training. Directs the State to make grants to and enter into contracts with specified entities to provide such training.
