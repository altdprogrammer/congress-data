Title III: Federal Support for Development Initiatives - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish: (1) a program to provide general financial assistance to cooperative HDTV enterprises to promote the discovery, development, and commercialization of HDTV technology; and (2) a separate program to provide financial assistance to support pilot manufacturing projects and experimental community demonstration related to HDTV technology. Requires the Secretary to award such financial assistance competitively. Requires the Secretary to submit to each House of the Congress and the President: (1) quarterly reports on the state of progress of the research, development, and commercialization assisted under this title; and (2) a comprehensive report on the results of the financial assistance provided under this title. Authorizes appropriations.
