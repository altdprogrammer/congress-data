    "text": "Patent Competitiveness and Technological Innovation Act of 1990 - Title I: Patents in Space - Patents in Space Act - Amends Federal patent law to provide that any invention made, used, or sold in outer space on a space object or component under the jurisdiction or control of the United States shall be considered made, used, or sold within the United States unless: (1) it has been specifically identified and otherwise provided for in an international agreement which the United States has signed; or (2) it is carried on the registry of a foreign state in accordance with the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space. Declares that any invention carried on such registry shall be considered made, used, or sold within the United States if it has been specifically so agreed in an international agreement between the United States and the state of registry. Applies this provision to all patents granted before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act, with certain exceptions. Titile II: Transgenic Animal Patent Improvements - Transgenic Animal Patent Improvements Act - Amends Federal patent law to declare that it shall not be an act of infringement for a person to: (1) reproduce a patented transgenic farm animal through breeding; (2) use it in the farming operation; or (3) sell it or its reproductive material in the farming operation (including germ cells, sperm, eggs or embryos). Authorizes the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to accept a deposit of biological material to satisfy patent application requirements. Declares that human beings are not patentable subject matter. Title III: Patent Remedy Clarification - Patent Remedy Clarification Act - Amends Federal law to declare that neither the States, their officers, nor their instrumentalities are immune from infringement liability. Provides the same remedies for infringement against State entities as are available against any private entity. Title IV: Research, Experimentation, and Competitiveness - Research, Experimentation, and Competitiveness Act of 1990 - Amends Federal patent law to declare it shall not be an act of infringement to make or use a patented invention solely for research or experimentation purposes unless the invention's primary purpose is research or experimentation. States that if a patented invention has a primary purpose of research or experimentation it shall not be an act of infringement to study, evaluate or characterize it to create a product outside the scope of the patent covering the invention. Title V: Contractor Invention Rights - Contractor Invention Rights Act - Amends Federal patent law regarding patent rights in inventions made with Federal assistance to outline the parameters of contractors rights in inventions developed pursuant to a Federal contract. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) consider certain principles of national security and sensitive information when implementing contractor invention rights; and (2) review contractor standards of conduct for resolving potential conflicts of interest, including those involving Department of Energy personnel, contractors, or the current business associates of former Department of Energy employees."
