    "text": "Marine Resources Support Act of 1989 - Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) to allow a fishery management plan, with regard to a vessel of the United States engaged in fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone, to include requirements that: (1) observers be carried on board to collect scientific data; and (2) fees to offset the cost of scientific research in the fishery be paid by the owner or operator of such a vessel. Authorizes the Regional Fishery Management Councils to establish the level of the fees. Prohibits an observer on a vessel from bringing a civil action for illness, disability, injury, or death from service as an observer against the vessel or its owner, except for the owner's willful misconduct. Establishes in the Treasury the Fisheries Research Fund to consist of all fees collected under this Act and all penalties collected under specified provisions of the Magnuson Act. Makes amounts in the Fund available to the Secretary of Commerce for: (1) supporting fishery management plans; (2) collecting, analyzing, and disseminating biological, economic, and statistical information concerning marine fisheries; and (3) improving enforcement of laws and treaties relating to marine recreational and commercial fishing. Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (Mammal Act) to direct the Secretary of Commerce to assess a fee on any individual, whether or not a U.S. citizen or national, who is over 16 years old and who has paid for the opportunity to view marine mammals in waters of the United States or any State. Establishes in the Treasury the Marine Mammal Research Fund to consist of all fees collected under this Act and fees and civil penalties collected under existing provisions of the Mammal Act. Makes amounts in the Fund available to the Secretary to carry out the Secretary's responsibilities under the Act."
