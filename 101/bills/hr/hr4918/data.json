Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, unless the President makes such notification, to instruct the U.S. executive directors of the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Development Association to oppose assistance to Iraq. Requires the Secretary of Transportation, unless the President makes such notification, to revoke the right of Iraqi air carriers to engage in air transportation with respect to the United States. Provides that unless the President makes such notification: (1) the President shall terminate any portion of a trade treatment or treaty that grants Iraq nondiscriminatory (most-favored-nation) trade agreement; (2) Iraq shall be denied such treatment and Iraqi products shall be subject to duty column two rates of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States; (3) the Generalized System of Preferences shall not apply to Iraq; and (4) Iraqi products not receiving duty-free treatment before this Act's enactment shall be subject to an additional duty at the rate of 50 percent ad valorem."
