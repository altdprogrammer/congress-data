    "text": "Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 - Title I: Purposes - Specifies the purposes of this Act, including regulatory reform, the establishment of an independent insurance agency to provide deposit insurance, and the provision of improved supervision and enhanced enforcement powers. Title II: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits held at savings associations as well as commercial banks. Increases the membership of the FDIC's Board of Directors from three to five members. Specifies that one of the additional two members shall be the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the other the Comptroller of the Currency. Revises certain definitions for the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Specifies that the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (DOTS) shall be considered the appropriate Federal banking agency in the case of a savings association or a savings and loan holding company. Provides that every FSLIC insured savings association shall continue to be insured by the FDIC without application or approval. Provides that whenever a depository institution files an application or notice for membership with, or to commence or resume business with, the appropriate Federal banking agency, such agency must provide such application to the FDIC for comment. Requires such agency to take the FDIC's comment into account in deciding whether to grant the application. Provides that certain State depository institutions shall continue as insured institutions. Allows any Federal savings association authorized to do business by the DOTS to become an insured depository institution upon the filing of an application with the FDIC together with a certificate issued by the DOTS unless insurance is denied by the FDIC. Sets forth procedures for the FDIC to evaluate such an application. Specifies the factors to be considered in granting or denying insurance coverage. Requires the FDIC to notify the DOTS if such insurance coverage is denied, and to give specific reasons in writing for such denial. Requires every noninsured depository institution which becomes insured by the FDIC to pay any entrance fee prescribed by FDIC regulations. Requires that such fee be credited to either the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) or the Savings Associations Insurance Fund (SAIF) depending on which fund the institution joins. Prohibits any insured depository institution from participating in any type of conversion transaction which would result in a change of membership from one such fund to the other without the approval of the FDIC. Places a five-year moratorium on the approval of such conversion transactions, except in limited circumstances. Requires financial institutions which participate in such conversion transactions to pay specified entrance and exit fees. Provides for conversion by merger. Provides that whenever the FDIC incurs a loss in connection with the default of an insured depository institution, or in connection with providing assistance to an insured depository institution in danger of default, any other commonly-controlled insured depository institution shall be liable to the FDIC and on request shall reimburse the FDIC for any such loss. Specifies the method of calculating such liability. Sets forth procedures for imposing and collecting such liability. Limits the rights of any third parties in such proceedings. Provides that for a five-year period no BIF members shall be held liable for the default of a BIF member. Defines \"commonly-controlled\" for purposes of determining such liability. Adds as a factor to be considered by the FDIC in evaluating applications for insurance coverage the risk presented to the BIF or the SAIF. Allows the FDIC, after reaching agreement with the other Federal banking agencies, to require insured depository institutions to file additional reports for insurance purposes. Requires the FDIC to set the assessment rate for insured depository institutions annually. Specifies that the annual assessment rate for BIF members shall be determined independently from the annual assessment rate for SAIF members. Prescribes the assessment rates for BIF members for 1989, 1990, and 1991 onward. Prescribes the assessment rates for SAIF members through 1990, for 1991 through 1993, for 1994 through 1997, and for 1998 onward. Allows the FDIC to raise or lower such assessment rates under specified circumstances. Specifies that such assessments shall be paid annually. Allows assessment credits to BIF members and SAIF members for years in which the reserve ratio is expected to exceed the designated reserve ratio in the succeeding year. Permits insured savings associations to offset secondary reserves against assessed premiums. Grants the FDIC the same authority to examine insured savings associations and to insure the deposits held at savings associations as it presently has with respect to insured banks. Establishes two insurance funds (the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Associations Insurance Fund (SAIF)) to be used by the FDIC to carry out the insurance purposes of this Act. Specifies that such funds are both to be operated and administered by the FDIC. Requires such funds to be separately maintained and not commingled. Specifies that the BIF shall consist of the assets of the Permanent Insurance Fund and all amounts assessed of BIF members. Specifies that the SAIF shall consist of all amounts assessed of SAIF members (which are not required for the Financing Corporation or the Resolution Funding Corporation pursuant to this Act) and of funds provided by the Secretary of the Treasury according to a specific schedule for FY 1991 through FY 1999. Authorizes the Secretary to provide additional amounts for such fund if the minimum net worth of the fund falls below a certain level. Authorizes appropriations for such funds. Authorizes the FDIC to borrow funds for the use of the SAIF. Provides that such borrowings shall be a direct liability of the SAIF and shall be subject to certain limitations. Revises and defines the authorities and duties of the FDIC as the receiver or conservator for insured Federal financial institutions and for insured State financial institutions. Specifies that all insurance payments made on account of a closed bank or insured branch of a foreign bank shall be made only from the Bank Insurance Fund and all payments made on account of a closed savings association shall be made only from the Savings Association Insurance Fund. Provides that when the FDIC pays insurance to a depositor, the FDIC shall be subrogated to the depositor's claim against the financial institution. (Such right of subrogation now applies only to national banks.) Sets forth the authorities and duties of the FDIC in the establishment of bridge banks in cases of failed or failing financial institutions. Authorizes the FDIC to sue such bridge banks in the case of failed or failing financial institutions as well as banks. Increases from one to three the number of times a bridge bank may be granted a one-year extension of its corporate existence. Prescribes procedures for the termination and dissolution of bridge banks. Establishes the FSLIC Resolution Fund (Fund). Specifies that such Fund shall be managed by the FDIC and shall be separately maintained and not commingled. Transfers to such Fund the reserves and assets, debts, obligations, contracts, and other liabilities of the FSLIC existing on the date of the dissolution of the FSLIC. Outlines the Fund's funding sources. Provides for additional funding by the Secretary of the Treasury from appropriated funds in the event such funding sources are insufficient. Limits any judgment resulting from a civil action against the FSLIC or the FDIC to the assets of such Fund. Dissolves such Fund upon the satisfaction of all debts and liabilities and the sale of all assets acquired in case resolutions. Requires that any funds remaining in such Fund be covered into the Treasury. Requires that any funds held in either the BIF or the SAIF must be invested in U.S. Government obligations or in obligations guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Allows the FDIC to request a 60-day stay of any legal proceedings to which it becomes a party due to its acquisition of any asset or in the exercise of certain authorities. Requires the FDIC, in determining whether to provide assistance to financial institutions, to consider: (1) the immediate and long-term obligations of the FDIC with respect to such assistance; and (2) the Federal tax revenues which would be foregone. Provides that transfers of assets or liabilities associated with any trust business may be effected by the FDIC in connection with any asset purchase transaction without any further State or Federal approval. Revises provisions relating to certain agreements against the interests of the FDIC. Specifies that the Board of Directors of the FDIC may act by a 75 percent vote (current law requires a unanimous vote) in order to override a State's objection to an assisted interstate acquisition of an insured financial institution in default having $500,000,000 or more in assets. Cites conditions which the Resolution Trust Corporation must consider when determining whether to provide monetary assistance upon the request of an SAIF member. Increases the borrowing authority of the FDIC from $3,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000. Makes such borrowing authority subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Limits any State or local tax to which the FDIC may be subjected when acting as a receiver or conservator of a financial institution. Limits the borrowing of both the BIF and the SAIF to the extent such liability reduces the fund's net worth to less than ten percent of assets. Requires the FDIC to report to the President and the Congress annually regarding its operations, activities, budget, receipts, and expenditures. (Current law requires an annual report regarding only the FDIC's operations.) Requires the FDIC to make quarterly reports to the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the FDIC's financial operating plans and forecasts. Makes all insured financial institutions subject to the Bank Merger Act. Makes the Office of Thrift Supervision the responsible agency with respect to mergers where the acquiring, assuming, or resulting institution is to be a savings association. Requires any insured savings association which establishes or controls a new company or elects to conduct any new activity to notify the FDIC and the DOTS. Grants the FDIC and DOTS certain enforcement powers with respect to any company controlled by an insured savings association. Authorizes the FDIC to determine activities which are incompatible with deposit insurance. Prohibits State savings associations from engaging in any activity unless permitted by the FDIC.
