Transfers related positions, property, records, obligations, commitments, and unexpended appropriations. Directs the Health Secretary to undertake a comprehensive program of epidemiological research into the health effects of workplace and public exposure to radiation and toxic substances with the aim of identifying the nature and magnitude of the risk to the public and to the workforce of Department of Energy (DOE) facilities resulting from activities of the DOE and its predecessors. Directs the Energy Secretary to submit to the Health Secretary and the Congress: (1) a complete listing of data and records held or maintained by the DOE and of potential use in the conduct and evaluation of epidemiological and related studies; and (2) a complete record of funds expended by that department on research related to the health effects of workplace and public exposure to radiation and toxic substances during each of the five years preceding enactment of this Act. Directs the Energy Secretary to provide to the Health Secretary access to all data and records not transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under other provisions of this Act if the records are deemed by the Health Secretary to be useful to epidemiological research, health risk assessments, and related studies, and if confidentiality requirements are met. Directs the Health Secretary to grant access to the public to data held or developed by HHS, including data obtained from DOE, in accordance with the established practices of HHS. Authorizes the Health Secretary to: (1) undertake such research into radiation releases, dose reconstruction, toxic substances exposures, and health risk assessments, as necessary to carry out the function transferred under specified provisions of this Act; and (2) review research conducted by DOE, after enactment of this Act, relating to such matters. Directs the Health Secretary to conduct a comprehensive review of: (1) existing epidemiological studies relating to health effects of exposure to such radiation and toxic substances as may present a threat to occupational or public health at DOE facilities; and (2) existing and ongoing health risk assessments and studies relating to such radiation releases, dose reconstruction, and toxic substance exposures as may present a threat to occupational or public health at DOE facilities. Establishes the Advisory Panel on Radiation and Toxic Substances Research to advise the Health Secretary in carrying out the function transferred from the Energy Secretary under this Act. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that the funding level to be provided each fiscal year to HHS for carrying out the function transferred by this Act should be at least as much as the greatest of the annual amounts reported by the Energy Secretary under provisions of this Act. Directs the Energy Secretary to reimburse HHS for all costs of carrying out the transferred function out of funds appropriated to the Energy Secretary. Allows funds provided to HHS for the purposes of this Act to be used to support: (1) a program of epidemiological research into the health effects of workplace and public exposure to radiation and toxic substances, and for other uses as the Secretary considers appropriate; and (2) activities of State public health agencies that are compatible with the purposes of this Act."
