Mandates that such program be established as a separate entity within the Bureau of Mines. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the President and the Congress detailing the program's progress. Requires the Director to conduct joint experimental projects with specified entities in the States of West Virginia, Idaho, and Nevada with regard to metallurgical-grade nodular and siliceous deposits processing, black sand processing, and the genesis of platinum group metals associated with hydrothermal ore deposits, respectively, and to report the project results to the Congress by a specified date. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
