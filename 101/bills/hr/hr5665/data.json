Requires each State's coastal management agency to submit to the Under Secretary for approval a Coastal Water Quality Protection Program to develop and implement coastal land use management measures for land-based sources of nonpoint source pollution. Provides for coordination and cooperation between the Under Secretary and other Federal agencies. Requires Federally licensed or permitted activities, including outer continental shelf exploration, development, or production, to be in compliance with State approved management programs. Requires the Under Secretary to: (1) recommend to the Congress a coastal energy impact program to meet the needs of coastal States and local governments resulting from energy facilities and related activities affecting natural resources, land uses, or water uses in the coastal zone; (2) implement a program to assist coastal States in fulfilling their responsibilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; and (3) make grants to any coastal State likely to be affected by outer continental shelf energy activities. Directs the Under Secretary to establish and maintain the Coastal Zone Management Fund for use in specified types of projects and situations. Directs the Under Secretary to implement an ongoing program to encourage each coastal State to make continual improvements in its management program in the national interest areas of: (1) coastal wetlands management and protection; (2) natural hazards management; (3) public access to coastal areas; (4) cumulative and secondary impacts of coastal growth and development; and (5) coastal energy development. Directs the Under Secretary to establish the Walter B. Jones Awards to promote excellence in coastal zone management by acknowledging outstanding accomplishments. Establishes the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Directs the Under Secretary to develop guidelines for research within the System and educational activities in reserves. Authorizes the Under Secretary to make grants to acquire lands and waters, to operate or manage a reserve and construct facilities, for educational or interpretive activities, and for research and monitoring within a reserve. Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions of this Act. Gives the consent of the Congress to two or more coastal States to negotiate and enter into agreements or compacts for: (1) developing and administering coordinated coastal zone planning, policies, and programs under provisions of this Act; and (2) establishing instrumentalities for the implementation of the agreements or compacts. Makes the agreements or compacts binding and obligatory upon any State or party thereto without further approval by the Congress.
