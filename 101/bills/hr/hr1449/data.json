    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the corporate income tax exclusion of contributions to the capital of the taxpayer. Includes as a qualifying contribution any amount of money or property received by a regulated public utility (a utility required to provide electric energy, gas, water, or sewage disposal services) that: (1) is a contribution in aid of construction (as defined by regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury); (2) meets certain expenditure requirements; and (3) is not included in the taxpayer's rate base. Excludes amounts paid as customer connection fees. Adds conditions under which a taxpayer will be treated as a material participant in a business or trade for purposes of passive loss rules affecting income tax liability. Amends accounting provisions to: (1) permit an exception from required application of the percentage completion method in the case of certain construction contracts for condominiums or cooperatives; and (2) apply the exemption of residential construction contracts from long-term contract accounting rules retroactively with respect to contracts entered into after February 28, 1986."
