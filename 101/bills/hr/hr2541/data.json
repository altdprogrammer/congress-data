    "text": "Helium Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Helium Act to eliminate provisions prohibiting the Secretary of Defense from entering into contracts and agreements for the acquisition, processing, transportation, or conservation of helium requiring Government payments in any one fiscal year totalling more than the initially appropriated amount. Requires the Secretary, beginning October 1, 1993, to: (1) manage the Federal Government's stored crude helium reserve solely to promote helium conservation and private sector helium development; and (2) sell helium from such reserve only when the Secretary determines that such sales are essential because of the inability of the private sector to supply critical helium requirements or to ensure national security. Authorizes the Secretary to permit or require Federal agencies, as designated by the Secretary, to purchase all helium requirements from the private sector prior to October 1, 1993. Requires the Defense and Energy Departments, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other Federal agencies, absent such specific designation and to the extent that supplies are readily available, to purchase all such requirements from the Secretary until such date. Requires all helium sales to be at prices determined by the Secretary that are consistent with this Act's purposes and that will not disrupt or discourage the private market for helium. Authorizes the Secretary to prohibit the export of helium sold by the Secretary. Requires all moneys received under this Act to be credited to the Helium Production Fund until October 1, 1993, when such Fund's unobligated balances and all such moneys shall be credited to the Treasury's General Fund. Provides for intragovernmental cooperation among the Secretaries of Defense and Energy, and the Administrator of NASA in carrying out this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to cancel outstanding indebtedness relating to the Helium Production Fund. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Helium Act in FY 1994 and thereafter."
