Requires: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a progress report within a year to specified congressional committees; and (2) each annual report to the Congress by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to describe the status of procedures in specified multilateral development banks specifically designed to increase the productive role of the poor in the economies of borrowing countries."
