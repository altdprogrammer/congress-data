Excludes from such copyright any right to prevent a pictorial representation of an architectural work if it is embodied in a structure located in a public place. Precludes the copyright owner of an architectural work from: (1) obtaining an injunction restraining the construction of an infringing structure if construction has substantially begun; or (2) obtaining a court order requiring the seizure or demolition of an infringing structure. Permits the owners of a structure embodying an architectural work to make certain minor alterations without the copyright owner's consent."
