  "summary": {
    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-07-30", 
    "text": "Amends the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 to: (1) authorize appropriations for grants to tribally-controlled community colleges and technical assistance contracts at the current fixed level for FY 1991 and at such sums as necessary for FY 1992; (2) authorize appropriations for the renovation and construction of Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities for use by such colleges at current levels for FY 1991 and 1992; (3) authorize appropriations for the Tribally-Controlled Community College Endowment Program (the Program) at the current fixed level for FY 1991 and at twice that amount for FY 1992; (4) increase the maximum allowable Federal contribution to the Program to $750,000; and (5) double the amount contributed by the Government for each amount raised by such a college. Revises formulae for determining the amounts of such grants and for adjusting such amounts for allocation among eligible applicants because of insufficient funding to require such determination and allocation to be based upon the Indian student count of the current year. Requires payments for such grants of not less than 95 percent of the funds available for allotment by October 15 or no later than 14 days after appropriations become available, with a payment equal to the remainder of any grant to which a grantee is entitled to be made no later than January 1 of each fiscal year. Requires initial allocations equal to 95 percent of an applicant's grant payment. Prohibits grants to establish an endowment trust fund (the fund) for the Program unless such a college enters into an agreement with the Secretary of the Interior which: (1) provides for the deposit of a capital contribution by the college in an amount or of a value equal to half of each Federal contribution; and (2) provides that if the college withdraws any of its capital contributions, an amount of Federal contributions equal to twice the amount or value of such withdrawal shall be withdrawn. Authorizes real or personal property contributed to such a college to qualify for Federal matching funds for deposit in the fund. Amends the Navajo Community College Act to authorize appropriations for construction grants for Navajo Community Colleges for FY 1991 and 1992. Directs the College to submit an inventory of repairs, alterations, and renovations to facilities required to meet health and safety standards for review by the Secretary for submission, with Department comments, to appropriate congressional committees. Amends the Augustus F. Hawkins, Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 to direct the Secretary of Education to make grants to, or contracts with, the governments of American Samoa and Guam: (1) to establish on each of those islands a Gifted and Talented Center; and (2) for demonstration projects to address the special needs of gifted and talented elementary and secondary school students and to provide support services to their families. Authorizes the Secretary, after the expiration of such grants or contracts, to make grants to or contracts with accredited higher education institutions on such islands for such Centers and programs. Authorizes grantees to subcontract to carry out such demonstration projects. Directs such Centers to participate in a national network of Native Hawaiian, American Indian, and Alaska Native Gifted and Talented Centers. Specifies the activities to be conducted under such demonstration projects to meet the educational and developmental needs of such students, including exploration of the use of Native languages and exposure to cultural traditions. Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory council to: (1) advise in the development of criteria to identify gifted and talented children and on the development of programs to meet the special needs of such children; (2) monitor the implementation of such programs and recommend appropriate changes; and (3) study and report to appropriate congressional committees on the feasibility of establishing such programs in other Pacific territories and possessions of the United States. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to make grants to such governments for demonstration programs to provide fellowship assistance to American Samoan and Guamanian students enrolled in accredited undergraduate or graduate degree programs. Specifies that programs for undergraduate assistance may include college preparation and guidance counseling at the secondary school level. Specifies that programs for graduate assistance may grant priority to professions in which American Samoans and Guamanians are underrepresented. Requires students receiving graduate assistance to enter into an enforceable contract obligation to provide their professional services to the communities on such islands. Authorizes appropriations for such programs for FY 1991 through 1994. Directs the Secretary to make a grant to or contract with the Rural College of the University of Alaska: (1) to establish an Alaska Native Gifted and Talented Center; and (2) for demonstration projects similar to those established for American Samoans and Guamanians. Directs the Center to coordinate its activities with those of the Alaska Department of Education and local school districts and to participate in a national network of other gifted and talented programs. Directs the Center to establish an advisory committee. Authorizes appropriations for such Center and programs for FY 1991 through 1994. Native American Language Act - States that it is U.S. policy to: (1) promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages; (2) allow exceptions to teacher certification requirements for Federal or federally funded programs for instruction in such languages when such requirements hinder employment of qualified Native American language teachers and to encourage State and territorial governments to make similar exceptions; (3) encourage and support the use of such languages as a medium of educational instruction; (4) encourage State and local education programs to work with Native American parents, educators, and governing bodies to implement programs to put this policy into effect; (5) recognize the right of such bodies to use such languages as a medium of instruction in all schools funded by the Secretary of the Interior; (6) recognize the right of such bodies, States, and U.S. territories and possessions to take action on, and give official status to, their Native American languages for purposes of conducting their own business; and (7) encourage all appropriate institutions of elementary, secondary, and higher education to include such languages in their curricula and to grant the same full academic credit for competency in such languages as for foreign languages to fulfill foreign language entrance or degree requirements. Declares that the right of Native Americans to express themselves through their languages shall not be restricted in any public proceeding, including publicly supported education programs. Directs Federal agency heads to: (1) evaluate their policies and procedures to determine and implement changes needed to bring them into compliance with this Act; and (2) evaluate the laws they administer and make recommendations to the President on amendments needed to bring such laws into compliance with this Act. Directs the President to report such recommendations to the Congress. Provides that this Act shall not be construed as precluding the use of Federal funds to teach English to Native Americans."
