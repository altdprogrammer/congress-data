    "text": "Amends the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 to establish additional requirements with respect to elementary and secondary drug abuse education and prevention programs. Requires State applications to include information on how the State educational agency will coordinate its drug education and prevention efforts with judicial officials. Requires that model curriculum materials clearly and consistently teach that illicit drug use is harmful. Provides that school-based programs of drug abuse prevention and early intervention may include: (1) the use of drug-free older students as positive role models; (2) instruction relating to self-esteem, drugs and drug addiction, decisionmaking and risk-taking, stress management techniques, and assertiveness; and (3) bringing law enforcement officers into the classroom to provide antidrug information and positive alternatives to drug use."
