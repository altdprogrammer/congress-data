Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations designating the areas in which smoking shall be allowed within Government buildings. Requires the conspicuous display of signs at building entrances and in areas where smoking is permitted. Declares that regulations under this Act shall not supersede a regulation providing more stringent restrictions on smoking, or prevent a department or agency from initiating more stringent restrictions on smoking. Requires departments or agencies in which labor organizations have been accorded recognition to engage in collective bargaining to implement regulations which affect work areas predominantly occupied by employees represented by such organizations. Requires any bargaining agreement to comply with this Act. Encourages departments and agencies to offer smoking cessation programs. Encourages Federal health plan carriers to provide coverage for such programs."
