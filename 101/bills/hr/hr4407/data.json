Requires States reporting under this Act to: (1) ensure that no State law enforcement agency establishes a policy which requires a waiting period before accepting a missing child or unidentified person report; (2) provide that each such report and all necessary and available information is entered into the State law enforcement system and the NCIC computer networks and made available to the Missing Children Information Clearinghouse or other designated agency within the State; and (3) require the law enforcement agency that entered the report into the NCIC to verify and update such record with any additional information (including, where available, medical and dental records), to institute or assist with appropriate search and investigative procedures, and to maintain close liaison with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for the exchange of information and technical assistance in the missing children cases."
