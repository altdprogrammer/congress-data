    "text": "Medical Care Cost Recovery Amendments of 1990 - Provides for third party reimbursement of the United States for the cost of health care and services furnished to a service-connected disabled veteran by the Department of Veterans Affairs for treatment of a nonservice-connected disability. (Present law applies to a nonservice-connected disability incurred by a veteran entitled to care under a health plan and who does not have a service-connected disability.) Deletes language allowing a third-party insurer to reimburse the United States in accordance with the prevailing rates at which the third party makes payments under comparable health-plan contracts with non-Federal facilities in the same geographical area. Establishes in the Treasury the Department of Veterans Affairs Third Party Medical Recoveries Fund to be used for identification, billing, and collection of the cost of care and services furnished by the Department on a reimbursable basis. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to transfer to such Fund in FY 1991 certain full-time employees who had previously been devoted to third party medical cost recovery activities as part of veterans' medical care appropriations. Requires necessary deposits into the Fund by January 1 of each year. Revises the definition of \"health-plan contract\" to provide that Medicare supplemental insurance plans shall be required to reimburse the Department for services provided to veterans by the Department under such a plan."
