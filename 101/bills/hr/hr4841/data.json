Earmarks specified amounts of such funds for: (1) debt-for-nature swaps and immediate environmental needs in Panama; (2) the voluntary demobilization, repatriation, and resettlement of members of the Nicaraguan Resistance and their families (provides such assistance only to members who are abiding by the cease-fire agreement and the Toncontin Agreement); (3) environmental activities in Nicaragua; and (4) administrative expenses incurred by the Agency for International Development. Makes supplemental appropriations for FY 1990 for emergency refugee admissions and assistance. Earmarks a specified amount of such funds for refugees resettling in Israel. Makes available an equitable amount of such funds for Pentecostals, Evangelicals, and Baptists to fund the existing refugee admissions numbers for the Soviet Union unless such numbers could be reallocated in this fiscal year to allow funding and admission of this group. Title II: General Provisions - Makes funds available under this Act notwithstanding prohibitions on assistance to countries in default on foreign assistance repayments and specified restrictions on foreign assistance appropriations."
