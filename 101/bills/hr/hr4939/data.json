Requires the President, in deciding whether to recommend such extension, to take into account: (1) the economic and political effects that such extension, or its absence, may have on Hong Kong; and (2) the extent to which China has moderated its position on the accession of Taiwan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Requires the President, if he recommends such extension, to include in a specified document to be submitted to the Congress a report on China's progress in implementing the above-mentioned measures. Title II: Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. nationals conducting industrial cooperation projects in China or Tibet should adhere to specified principles, including to: (1) suspend the use of merchandise manufactured by convict or forced labor; (2) seek to ensure political and religious freedom without harm to anyone's employment status; (3) ensure that methods of production do not pose a danger to project employees and the surrounding environment; (4) strive to use business enterprises that are not controlled by China; and (5) promote human rights in China. Requires the Secretary of State to forward a copy of such principles to member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and encourage them to promote such principles. Requires each U.S. national to register with the Secretary of State and indicate whether he or she agrees to implement such principles. Sets forth specified reporting requirements. Declares that Federal agencies may intercede with a foreign government or national regarding export marketing activity in China or Tibet on behalf of a U.S. national subject to such reporting requirements only if the national adheres to the principles of this Act."
