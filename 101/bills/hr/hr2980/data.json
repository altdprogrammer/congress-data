    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-07-24", 
    "text": "USHealth Program Act - Division A: USHealth Program - Title I: Eligibility and Enrollment - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to establish the USHealth Program (Program) for the provision of comprehensive medical care, without regard to age or disability status to: (1) U.S. citizens; (2) permanent U.S. residents; and (3) aliens who are employed with a foreign government or international organization and reside in the United States, provided an executive agreement can be arranged with such government or organization for payments into the Program. Provides for the possibility of incorporating foreign visitors into the program. Repeals title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act and provisions of various other benefit programs rendered superfluous by the comprehensive nature of the USHealth Program. Makes conforming amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974. Title II: Benefits and Providers - Lists Program benefits which comprise: (1) inpatient hospital and inpatient psychiatric hospital services; (2) medical and other health services; (3) comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services; (4) medical care access facility services; (5) extended care services; (6) home health services; (7) hospice care; (8) long-term care for a chronically ill individual; (9) alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation services; and (10) outpatient mental health services. Amends the Medicare program to expand covered medical and other health services to include: (1) nurse practitioner and clinical nurse specialist services; (2) periodic screening and diagnosis of individuals under age 21 to ascertain their physical or mental defects and the care necessary to correct or ameliorate discovered defects; (3) family planning services and supplies for individuals of child-bearing age; (4) private duty nursing services; (5) eyeglasses and dental services, with specified conditions; (6) prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices; (7) physical therapy; and (8) other diagnostic, preventive, and rehabilitative services. Directs the USHealth Board (Board) to review coverage limitations on mental health services and to make such changes as will improve access to such services while containing costs. Requires the Board to report to the Congress on whether Program coverage should include services of pediatric and geriatric assessment units. Makes the Program the primary payor where items and services provided may also be covered by a group health plan. Sets forth certification standards for long-term care, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services, outpatient physical therapy services, and outpatient speech pathology services. Uses funds authorized for the rural health care transition grant program under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 for the development of medical care access facilities. Defines a \"medical care access facility\" as a facility which: (1) provides ambulatory, primary, emergency, urgent, and surgical care; (2) provides inpatient care for from one-to-ten inpatient beds for stays not exceeding 48 hours; and (3) is located in a medically underserved area or a county with a population of less than 20,000, or serves a frontier service area. Provides Medicare coverage of facility services. Authorizes such facilities to provide dietician, pharmacist, laboratory technician, medical technologist, and radiological services on a part-time, off-site basis, and remain open for less time than Medicare hospitals. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992 for grants creating medical care access facilities in communities which lack hospitals and assisting hospitals in being converted into such facilites. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Medical rural health clinic demonstration program: (1) testing new payment methodologies for clinic services; (2) covering early detection procedures, health education, and health risk reduction services; (3) easing staffing requirements for clinics that have been unable to recruit physician assistants or nurse practitioners; and (4) reducing physician, physician assistant, and nurse practitioner productivity standards for sparsely populated areas. Requires the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration to provide for and annually report to the Congress on additional research and demonstration projects into how the Medicare and Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) programs could be changed to better cover care for beneficiaries residing in rural areas and in central city areas of large cities. Directs the Board to develop policies and protocols to assure the appropriate coordination in payments and identification of benefits for Medicare long-term care and acute health care services. Title III: Payments for Services - Ties changes in the payment rate for services provided under the Program to changes in the gross national product (GNP) over a payment period, with adjustments in payments among services being made in response to changes in the utilization of such services. Limits payments for noninstitutional care provided to chronically-ill individuals. Sets forth a formula for determining the payment due to hospitals for capital-related costs which takes into account capital resource use associated with differing diagnosis-related groups as well as changes in the GNP. Directs the USHealth Board to establish a payment schedule for each class of covered health care services and periodically adjust such schedules to reflect GNP changes as well as regional and qualitative differences in services provision. Requires that payment rates for physicians' services and other professional services reflect the particular costs of furnishing such services and take into account the full-time coverage and low-volume of services characteristic of rural areas. Authorizes the Board to provide for the payment of services under an alternative reimbursement system established by a State, provided the system does not increase the cost or reduce the quality of such services. Provides funding to States establishing such a system. Cuts a State's required contribution to the Program by 50 percent of the savings which result from use of the State's alternative system. Directs the Board to establish a toll-free, telephone hotline to handle inquiries concerning Medicare payments for certified registered nurse specialist, certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, and clinical nurse specialist services.

(Currently, 95 percent of the costs are covered.) Restricts coverage to HMOs qualified under the Public Health Service Act. Requires HMOs to provide enrollees with all services covered by this Act. Directs the Board to conduct a national campaign encouraging eligible individuals to enroll with HMOs. Title IV: Financing Program - Requires USHealth beneficiaries to pay the first $100 of payments made for covered outpatient drugs and, subject to specified maximum payment limits, 25 percent of the payments provided for custodial long-term care services and 20 percent of the payments provided for other services (in addition to nominal copayments). Waives the coinsurance requirement where such payments would place a family's income below the Federal poverty level. Provides that the failure to pay coinsurance amounts will not result in loss of benefit entitlement. Alters the formula for determining the monthly Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) premium for individuals age 65 or older, requiring the elimination of such premium when the individual's family income falls below the Federal poverty level. Phases-out such premium for elderly beneficiaries by the year 2005. Eliminates such premium for disabled beneficiaries. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to phase-down the supplemental premium rate so that it reaches zero by the year 2005. Indexes increases to the ceiling on such premium to increases in the per capita GNP. Reduces an individual's supplemental premium by the amount of surtax he or she paid for the coverage of excess Program costs. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Act to extend the wages on which the Hospital Insurance tax is levied to an unlimited dollar amount after 1989. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax, to be paid into the USHealth Program Trust Fund (Trust Fund), on wages and self-employment income, including in such tax certain Federal, State, and church employment.

Amends the Medicare program to require the States to pay into the Trust Fund an amount equal to 50 percent of Program payments made to families whose income falls below the Federal poverty level. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a surtax on personal income to cover the amount by which estimated Program costs for a calendar year will exceed Program revenues. Amends the Medicare program to establish the USHealth Program Trust Fund which is to replace the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, Federal Catastrophic Drug Insurance Trust Fund, and Medicare Catastrophic Account and be administered by the Board.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the exclusion of employer health insurance contributions from income computations. Title V: Quality Assurance - Amends part B (Peer Review) of title XI of the Act to establish a National Council on Quality Assurance. Directs the Director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to provide for the appointment of members of the Council. States that the general functions of the Council shall be to: (1) provide oversight of the operations of the quality assurance system; and (2) make recommendations annually to the Board and the Congress for improvements in the system.

Requires contracts with peer review organizations to provide that: (1) at least one-half of the organizations' efforts must be on quality assurance activities; and (2) quality assurance activities shall be conducted with respect to all the different types of items and services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or through a private payor. Adds to the definition of the term \"peer review organization\" so as to require such an entity to: (1) include representatives of quality assurance activities; and (2) have a consumer advisory board. Defines a \"consumer advisory board.\" Requires peer review organizations to review health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Requires any peer review organization to: (1) educate USHealth beneficiaries; (2) provide for a toll-free telephone number, which shall be provided to USHealth beneficiaries for the purpose of receiving questions and complaints from USHealth beneficiaries; (3) assist in resolving any such complaints that are legitimate; (4) make available to its consumer advisory boards appropriate information received from the telephone service; and (5) train members of its consumer advisory board. Appropriates funds, in addition to any other amounts appropriated to carry out part B of title XI, from the Trust Fund for distribution to peer review organizations. Amends the Medicare program to impose quality assurance requirements on home health agencies and long-term care management agencies, including requirements that such agencies implement grievance review procedures, ensure that their providers receive adequate training, and develop and periodically review plans of care for their clients. Requires home health agencies and providers to provide clients with information and training concerning the use of durable medical equipment. Requires long-term care management agencies to supply their clients with a written statement of the services they will receive and a copy of the consumer bill of rights to be promulgated by the Board. Directs the Board to: (1) establish procedures for surveying home health and long-term care management agencies; (2) encourage and report on State progress in developing home health agency licensing policies and procedures; and (3) provide grants for training programs for home health agencies and providers and long-term care management agencies. Authorizes appropriations for such activities in FY 1993 and thereafter. Requires hospitals to implement a discharge planning process which meets guidelines and standards to be established by the Board, in conjunction with the National Council on Quality Assurance, to: (1) protect against inappropriate early hospital discharges; (2) ensure a timely and smooth transition to the most appropriate type of and setting for post-hospital care; and (3) permit early initiation of the authorization process for continuing care services.
