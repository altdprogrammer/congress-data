Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make grants from such Fund to local governments adversely affected by reduced Department of Defense spending, the cancellation or termination of a Defense contract, or the failure to proceed with a previously approved major defense acquisition program to assist such local governments in addressing the needs of community economic adjustment. Authorizes appropriations."
