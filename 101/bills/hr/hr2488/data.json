    "text": "Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to notify any foreign air carrier that does not comply with the security plan the Administrator has accepted for it, recommending the necessary compliance steps. Directs the Administrator to inform the Secretary of State (Secretary) whenever he or she determines that such foreign air carrier has failed to take corrective action. Requires the Secretary to issue a travel advisory with respect to any foreign air carrier that fails to take such measures to comply with a security plan. Requires the Secretary to publish at least annually the names of those nations which are not signatories of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. Directs the Administrator to establish procedures to ensure that U.S. air carriers: (1) acknowledge receipt of a security bulletin; and (2) notify the FAA of any actions taken in response to such bulletin. Requires procedures for ascertaining the response of foreign air carriers to such bulletins. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary should seek bilateral and multilateral agreements which would require that foreign airports comply with FAA security bulletin procedures established for U.S. air carriers. Authorizes U.S. diplomatic security personnel, at the request of the Secretary of Transportation, to assist U.S. Department of Transportation personnel in monitoring the implementation of security measures by foreign air carriers. Sets forth guidelines for the distribution of FAA security bulletins at diplomatic and consular posts. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a program to facilitate telephone inquiries by next-of-kin about disasters that happen abroad which affect U.S. citizens; and (2) institute a program of training in crisis management for consular officers. Authorizes appropriations for the telephone inquiry program."
