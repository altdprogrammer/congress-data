  "summary": {
    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-01", 
    "text": "Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 for the Maritime Administration for: (1) operating-differential subsidies; (2) manpower, education, and training; (3) operating programs; (4) national security support capabilities; and (5) the Ready Reserve Force. Amends Federal law to replace provisions authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to make research grants to a National Maritime Enhancement Institute from amounts appropriated under specified provisions with provisions authorizing the Secretary to make awards to an institute from amounts appropriated. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to require that the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, established by current law, be established for a term of two years commencing at the beginning of each Congress. Replaces provisions authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to acquire suitable vessels in exchange for obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) with provisions authorizing the Secretary to acquire suitable vessels with funds in the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund derived from the sale of obsolete vessels in the NDRF. Allows, notwithstanding specified provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916, vessels sold under these provisions to be scrapped in approved foreign markets. Amends Federal law to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from implementing any ship sharing program until 60 legislative days (currently, 60 days) after the submission of a study required by current law. Prohibits the Secretary from taking any vessel, currently in service as a State academy training vessel, out of service to implement any alternative program, including ship sharing, until or unless the vessel is incapable of being maintained in good repair as required under provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. Extends until October 1, 1994, the effective date of provisions mandating that State maritime academies require passage of a Coast Guard licensing examination as a condition for: (1) graduation by an individual; and (2) any payment or use of any vessel received by such an academy under specified provisions after December 31, 1989. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to allow the Secretary of Transportation to recover from an individual all costs of education provided by the Federal Government at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (Academy) if the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under provisions relating to failure to fulfill commitment agreements. Directs the Secretary, if the Secretary decides to recover the costs, to request the Attorney General to begin court proceedings to recover the costs. Allows the Secretary to permit, in addition to those allowed under other provisions, additional individuals from the Republic of Panama to receive instruction at the Academy. (Current law allows the Secretary to annually permit, until September 30, 1995, in addition to those allowed under other provisions, up to six additional individuals from the Republic of Panama to receive instruction at the Academy.) Requires that the Secretary be reimbursed for the cost of the instruction. (Current law requires that the Republic of Panama reimburse the Secretary.) Defines, for purposes of provisions relating to Naval Reserve requirements and to documentation of vessels, as applied to fishing vessels operating off the coast of California, that the term \"citizen of the United States\" includes lawful permanent resident aliens. Terminates such application of the definition on October 1, 2000. Requires that specified ports in North Carolina have the same privileges under Article III of the Agreement Regarding Certain Maritime Matters Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as those ports listed in Annex I of the agreement. Declares that, notwithstanding provisions Federal law relating to documentation of vessels, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may issue a certificate of documentation for employment in the coastwise, Great Lakes, or fisheries trade to 38 specified vessels. Declares that, notwithstanding specified provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, a vessel owned by a nonprofit corporation for use exclusively as an oceanographic research vessel and meeting other requirements has not been \"sold foreign\" unless it has been placed under the registry of a foreign nation. Deems a specified vessel to be less than a certain weight and directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, in applying the regulations relating to the inspection of passenger vessels, to inspect under regulations applying to vessels of that weight. Directs the Secretary, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to inspect the vessel under specified provisions of Federal regulations. Requires any certification issued under those regulations to permit that vessel to carry not more than a specified number of passengers on lakes, bays, and sounds service. Merchant Mariner Memorial Act of 1990 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to convey to any group of two or three nonprofit organizations, without consideration, the right, title, and interest of the United States in a vessel of a specified minimum displacement tonnage in the National Defense Reserve Fleet for use in funding a merchant marine memorial, provided the vessel no usefulness to the Government and is scheduled to be scrapped and the organizations agree to sell the vessel for scrap, divide the proceeds equally, and use them for the memorial. Requires organizations to have raised a minimum amount from non-Federal sources before enactment of this Act. Allows an organization to apply individually or as a member of a group. Directs the Secretary to designate groups of two or three nonprofits. Prohibits an organization from being a member of more than one group. Directs the Secretary to deliver a vessel conveyed: (1) at its location on the date of approval of the conveyance; (2) in its condition on that date; and (3) at no cost to the Government. Terminates the Merchant Mariner Memorial Act of 1990 two years after enactment. Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carrier Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Shipping Act of 1984 to require each non-vessel-operating common carrier (NVO) to furnish to the Federal Maritime Commission a bond of an amount set (subject to a specified minimum) by the Commission to insure the financial responsibility of the carrier, making the bond available to pay any judgment for damages from transportation-related activities, any order for reparations, or any penalty assessed. Requires an NVO not domiciled in the United States to designate a resident agent in the United States for receipt of service. Provides for enforcement of tariff, bond, and resident agent requirements of specified provisions of the Shipping Act of 1984."
