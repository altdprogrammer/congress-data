Amends the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1986 to extend through FY 1992 an annual report requirement under such Act concerning the furnishing of non-service-connected health care to veterans. Extends through FY 1991 the authority for the operation of the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in the Philippines. Title II: Health-Care Personnel - Provides the qualifications required for social workers employed by the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Requires a minimum two-year service requirement in the Department for graduates of the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Professional Scholarship Program. Authorizes the Secretary to purchase promotional items of nominal value for recruitment purposes. Authorizes a person appointed as a part-time employee of the Administration to receive and retain amounts paid for appearances, speeches, and articles that do not create a conflict of interests. Title III: Health-Care Management - Requires a 60-day congressional notification period before the Secretary may undertake an administrative reorganization within the Department.
