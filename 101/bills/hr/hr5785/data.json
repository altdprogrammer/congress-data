Prohibits the Secretary from implementing the latter design changes unless the Congress approves. Mandates that amounts in the coinage profit fund which are attributable to net profits from the sale of uncirculated and proof sets of coins shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt."
