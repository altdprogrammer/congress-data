    "date": "1990-10-27", 
    "text": "Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 - Title I: Civil Justice Expense and Delay Reduction Plans - Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require U.S. district courts to implement a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan to facilitate adjudication, monitor discovery, improve litigation management, and provide for just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of civil disputes. Requires: (1) civil justice expense and delay reduction plans to be developed or selected after consideration of the recommendations of an advisory group of a district court; and (2) the advisory group to complete an assessment of the state of the court's civil and criminal dockets. Specifies the content of such plans which shall include provisions applying the following principles: (1) systematic, differential treatment of civil cases; (2) early and ongoing control of the pretrial process through involvement of a judicial officer in assessing and planning the progress of a case, setting early, firm trial dates, controlling discovery, and setting deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition; (3) monitoring of complex cases through discovery-case management conferences at which the presiding judicial officer explores the parties' receptivity to settlement, identifies the principal issues in contention, prepares a discovery schedule and plan, and establishes deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition; and (4) authorization to refer appropriate cases to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) programs. Sets forth provisions for review of district court plans and reports and for periodic assessment of the condition of the courts' civil and criminal dockets. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to prepare a semiannual report on each judicial officer that discloses: (1) the number of motions that have been pending for more than six months and the name of each case in which such motion has been pending; (2) the number of bench trials that have been submitted for more than six months and the name of each case in which such trials are under submission; and (3) the number and names of cases that have not been terminated within three years of filing. Authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to develop one or more model plans. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to submit to the U.S. district courts and to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees copies of any model plan and any accompanying report. Requires the Judicial Conference to: (1) prepare and submit to the U.S. district courts and to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees plans received within four years; (2) study ways to improve litigation management and dispute resolution services in the district courts, and make recommendations to such courts on ways to improve such services, on a continuing basis; and (3) prepare, periodically revise, and transmit to the U.S. district courts a Manual for Litigation Management and Cost and Delay Reduction. Requires the Directors of the Federal Judicial Center and the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to expand judicial training programs to include litigation management. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office to ensure that each U.S. district court has the automated capability to readily retrieve information about the status of each case in such court. Requires the Judicial Conference to conduct demonstration programs under which specified U.S. district courts experiment with systems of differentiated case management and various methods of reducing cost and delay in civil litigation, including ADR. Sets forth reporting requirements. Directs the Judicial Conference to conduct a pilot program whereby ten district courts designated by the Conference implement expense and delay reduction plans. Requires that a program study report on the results be submitted to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and that the Conference initiate rulemaking proceedings to implement its recommendations or identify alternatives to be implemented. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Federal Judgeships - Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 - Directs the President to appoint additional circuit and district judges (including temporary district judges) and to make modifications in certain existing judgeships. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to: (1) review the policies, procedures, and methodologies used by the Judicial Conference in recommending to the Congress the creation of additional Federal judgeships; and (2) report to specified congressional committees on the results of the review and any recommendations for revisions of the process. Title III: Implementation of Federal Courts Study Committee Recommendation - Federal Courts Study Committee Implementation Act of 1990 - Requires the Federal Judicial Center to conduct a study and submit to the Congress a report on the number and frequency of conflicts among the judicial circuits in interpreting the law that remain unresolved because they are not heard by the Supreme Court, considering whether the conflict: (1) imposes economic costs or other harm on persons engaging in interstate commerce; (2) encourages forum shopping among circuits; (3) creates unfairness to litigants in different circuits; or (4) encourages nonacquiescence by Federal agencies in the holdings of the courts of appeals for different circuits that are unlikely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. Requests that the Center: (1) study structural alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals; and (2) submit to the Congress and the Judicial Conference of the United States, within two years, a report on such study. Directs the President, in any case in which a U.S. judge assumes the duties of a full-time office of Federal judicial administration, to appoint an additional judge for the court on which the judge serves. Authorizes: (1) an extension of the term of office of a bankruptcy judge with the approval of the judicial council of the circuit; and (2) the judicial councils of two or more circuits to establish a joint bankruptcy appellate panel, subject to specified conditions. Initiates a retirement program for Claims Court judges aged 65 or older, basing annuities upon specified age and length of service criteria as determined in accordance with this Act. Includes provisions to cover retirement due to disability. Precludes judges who elect this new annuity program from receiving civil service retirement benefits. Permits the recall of retired judges to perform judicial duties, subject to certain conditions. Sets forth the administrative features of the annuity plan. Provides for the forfeiture of annuities by retired Claims Court judges who: (1) in the practice of law, represent a client in a civil claim against the United States; (2) fail to perform required judicial duties (such forfeiture to occur for a one-year period); or (3) accept Government civil office or employment compensation (such forfeiture to occur for the period the compensation is received). Makes forfeitures inapplicable in specified cases where a retired judge elects to freeze the amount of the annuity. Sets forth procedures with respect to revoking an election to receive an annuity. Establishes the Claims Court Judges Retirement Fund. Authorizes appropriations. Provides for survivors' annuities for survivors of Claims Court judges who retire under the system established by this Act. Entitles retired Claims Court judges who elect the retirement system under this Act to lump-sum credits under Federal provisions governing civil service compensation. Sets forth provisions: (1) authorizing judges of the U.S. Claims Court to elect to contribute a portion of their basic pay to the Thrift Savings Fund; (2) defining \"retirement\" and \"retire\" for purposes of this section to include removal from office on the sole ground of mental or physical disability; (3) authorizing sums so contributed to be invested and reinvested only in the Government Securities Investment Fund; and (4) specifying that, where such a judge receives a distribution from the Thrift Savings Plan and later receives a specified annuity, such annuity shall be offset by an amount equal to the amount which represents the Government's contribution to that person's Thrift Savings Account. Makes Claims Court judges eligible for annuities currently available for bankruptcy judges and U.S. magistrates. Amends the Federal judicial code to require a district court judge or a magistrate to advise parties to civil actions that they are free to withhold consent to the exercise of the magistrate's jurisdiction without adverse consequences. Extends the time period during which a magistrate may continue to serve after the expiration of a term of office. Sets forth provisions with respect to abstention determinations under the Federal bankruptcy and judicial codes and with respect to remand determinations under the judicial code. Grants district courts supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are so related to claims in civil actions of which such courts have original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution, including claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. Denies district courts such jurisdiction over certain types of claims involving diversity of citizenship. Authorizes such courts to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if: (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction. Requires the period of limitations for any claim asserted under the courts supplemental jurisdiction, and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of such claim, to be tolled while such claim is pending in Federal court and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period. Defines \"State\" to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. Authorizes a civil action where jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship to be brought only in the judicial district in which: (1) any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State; (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action commenced.
