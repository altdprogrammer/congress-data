Requires each State not to prohibit railroad employees from access to the State's workers' compensation program. Requires that any claim against a railroad by an employee of that railroad for injury, death, or occupational disease arising out of or in the course of the employee's employment be treated the same as the claims of non-railroad employees against their employers brought under the State's workers' compensation laws. Subjects the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) to the workers' compensation taxes, fees, and assessments of a State in the same manner and to the same extent as any other interstate entity doing business within the State and governed by its workers' compensation laws."
