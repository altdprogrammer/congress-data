Directs the Secretary to establish a program to require operators of such facilities to report potential or existing pipeline facility navigational hazards through Coast Guard offices. Requires marking of the hazards with approved marine buoys. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a mandatory, systematic, and where appropriate, periodic inspection program in the Gulf and its inlets; and (2) require burial of exposed or hazardous facilities. Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to encourage fishermen and other vessel operators to report potential or existing navigational hazards involving pipelines through Coast Guard offices."
