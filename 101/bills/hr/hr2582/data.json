Includes among such alternatives the designation of such sites as units of the National Park System. Requires the Secretary to transmit such study to specified congressional committees. Establishes the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission to prepare a study of historically significant sites and structures associated with the Civil War, other than Shenandoah Valley Civil War sites. Requires the Commission to transmit such study to the Secretary and the same congressional committees. Terminates such Commission after the transmittal of such report to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to undertake a complete revision of the National Park Service \"Thematic Framework\" to reflect current scholarship and research on: (1) American history and culture; (2) historic and prehistoric archeology; and (3) architecture. Requires the Secretary to transmit the revision to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Review of Boundaries of Units of the National Park System - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to conduct boundary reviews for units of the National Park System. Provides that initial and subsequent studies shall address: (1) the adequate protection and preservation of the resources relevant to each unit; and (2) the most efficient management of each unit. Requires that study procedures allow for public input and consultation and coordination with affected Federal, State, and local agencies. Empowers the Director to develop study criteria for boundary studies conducted after completion of the high priority studies mandated by this Act. Calls for the submission of the final criteria to specified congressional committees after publication in the Federal Register. Requires the Director to notify the same committees in writing of at least 25 units of the National Park System which have the highest priority for review and study. Requires a report to the committees on the results of such review and study. Provides that after completion of the high priorities studies and the required report, the Director shall undertake an ongoing study program of specific park unit boundaries either separately or in conjunction with a general management plan. Requires the Director to report on prior boundary adjustment studies that were done as part of a general management plan, but for which no legislative proposal was submitted to the Congress by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: National Park System Advisory Board - Amends the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act to extend, through 1995, the National Park System Advisory Board. Establishes the National Park Service Advisory Council to advise and counsel the Board."
