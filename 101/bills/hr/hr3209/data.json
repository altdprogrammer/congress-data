Requires the Secretary to complete a protection plan that includes provisions for public access for fishing, canoeing, hiking and other public activities consistent with continued wetland and resource protection for the Little Calumet River Corridor and the Salt Creek Corridor. Requires studies of the Deep River Corridor, Beverly Shores wetlands, and Union Station to be submitted to specified congressional committees. Allows individual property owners within Lakeshore boundaries to retain use and occupancy rights on improved property for noncommercial residential purposes. Authorizes appropriations for the development of the Lakeshore. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with Gary, Indiana, for technical assistance for programs and development in the city's Marquette Park and Lake Street Beach. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Transportation to determine what lands and interests the State requires for improvements to certain roads. Changes from mandatory to discretionary the Secretary's authority to acquire an area in the Lakeshore known as Crescent Dunes. (Currently, the Secretary must acquire such area within two years of a specified date.) Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with Northern Indiana Public Service Company which shall provide certain access, preservation, and resource management of the Greenbelt area in the Lakeshore. Designates the National Park Service visitor center at the Lakeshore the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center. Authorizes appropriations."
