Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to carry out such programs with specified funds. Defines an eligible severely disadvantaged youth as one who: (1) is between 16 and 25 years old; (2) is economically disadvantaged; (3) has dropped out of elementary or secondary school or has received a secondary school degree but whose reading and mathematics skills are both below the eighth grade level; (4) has not participated in an education or training program in nine months preceding the month in which he or she enrolls in the program under this Act; and (5) has less than 150 hours work experience in a specified nine-month period. Requires program grant applicants to form eligible partnerships, which shall include a public agency or private nonprofit organization and a business concern or association. Allows program funds to be used for: (1) individual assessment; (2) intensive basic skills training combined with vocational training and/or work experience; (3) support services; (4) job development and placement services; (5) a monitoring period after program completion, with support services to assist in retaining employment or advancing toward an educational degree; and (6) other appropriate services to further job placement. Directs the Secretary to evaluate services provided by eligible partnerships funded under this Act. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on such evaluation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
