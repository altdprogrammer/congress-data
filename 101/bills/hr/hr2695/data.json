Directs the NRC to provide continuous access to such information to regional response teams and centers, on-scene coordinators, and all State and local government officials responsible for directing responses to such discharges or releases. Requires the head of each Federal agency having a representative on the NRT to ensure that all such individuals have ready accessibility to all relevant, unclassified data. Directs the President to take such actions as may be necessary to encourage appropriate international organizations to establish an international inventory of emergency response resources."
