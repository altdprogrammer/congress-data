Declares that the provisions afford the same protection in the carrying out of a contract as they do in connection with the making or enforcement of that contract. States that the rights do not extend: (1) as against an individual, to personal services provided to that individual not in connection with that individual's business activities; or (2) to an employment relationship with an employer other than an employer as defined in specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
