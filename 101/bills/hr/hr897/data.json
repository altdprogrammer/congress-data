Sets forth elements which must be included in the plan and a specific schedule for FY 1991 through 1993, including requirements relating to an oceanographic research vessel and a fisheries research vessel. Authorizes NOAA to fill ten additional personnel positions in connection with the modernization and expansion. Requires that an implementation plan be submitted to the Congress. Authorizes the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, notwithstanding specified provisions and if the Under Secretary makes certain findings, to enter into multi-year contracts for the construction, lease, or other acquisition of property, including vessels, and a multi-year charter agreement for a vessel. Authorizes the Under Secretary to provide in each contract or charter agreement for the liability of the United States in the event of termination of the contract or agreement before expiration of its term. Requires all modernization or construction work performed on vessels under this Act to be carried out, and all vessels acquired by NOAA after enactment of this Act to have been built, in private shipyards in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993. Directs the Under Secretary, prior to obtaining a new NOAA vessel, to review the inventory of vessels acquired by the Government as a result of certain loan defaults with regard to the suitability of such vessels for NOAA's use. Requires each new vessel constructed for NOAA be in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping Standards."
