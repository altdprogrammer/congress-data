Directs the ODA to: (1) disseminate information to Federal, State, and local agencies with respect to the cancellation of major defense contracts; (2) implement a program for job retraining and extension of health and unemployment benefits to workers displaced from defense-related employment as the result of such cancellations; (3) coordinate job information services in the Department of Labor and in State and local government agencies; (4) disseminate information on Federal programs pertaining to economic adjustment for distressed communities, businesses, and workers; and (5) provide and coordinate technical assistance to private industry and State and local governments to assist them in developing adjustment plans for communities affected by such cancellations. Requires the Secretary of Defense, acting through the ODA, to notify Federal, State, and local agencies of the cancellation or termination of a major defense contract at least six months before such action or such shorter period if required for national security reasons or a military emergency."
