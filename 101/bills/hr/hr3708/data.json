    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to regulate air pollution from Outer Continental Shelf activities, including: (1) stationary sources on or above the Shelf; (2) vessels engaged in activities authorized under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or engaged in oil or gas exploration or development; and (3) power generating units on shore which power a facility engaged in activities on waters above the shelf or regulated under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Requires new stationary sources to obtain a State permit which will require the lowest achievable emission rate for each air pollutant. Requires other sources within range of the new source to offset emissions of any pollutant from such new source. Requires existing sources, within two years, to achieve the lowest achievable emission rate for each air pollutant. Authorizes compliance inspections."
