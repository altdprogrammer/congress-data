    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-06-12", 
    "text": "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 for intelligence activities in specified departments and agencies of the U.S. Government, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Defense (DOD). Declares that the authorized amounts and personnel ceilings for such intelligence activities are those specified in the classified schedule of authorizations. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to permit employment of civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1991. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 240 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Subjects activities and personnel of the staff to the National Security Act of 1947 and the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 in the same manner as activities and personnel of the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1991. Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency Administrative Provisions - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) authorize the adjustment of status of certain U.S. Government employees performing services in a foreign country essential to the needs of the U.S. Government; and (2) modify the definition of \"former spouse\" to require, for purposes of qualifying for coverage under the Central Intelligence Agency Disability and Retirement System (CIADRS), that at least five years of creditable service have been spent outside the United States by both the CIADRS participant and the former spouse during the participant's service as an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. Deletes a provision requiring: (1) an officer or employee who elects to accept designation as a participant to remain a participant for the duration of his or her employment with the Agency; and (2) making such election irrevocable and not subject to review. Permits a retired participant whose annuity was not reduced at retirement in order to provide a survivors annuity for a spouse or former spouse and who remarries after retirement to elect to reduce such annuity to provide an annuity for the new spouse. Requires that any executive order that conforms CIADRS to the Civil Service Retirement System by lowering the remarriage age for termination of surviving spouses' annuities from 60 to 55 be given retroactive effect. Entitles a surviving spouse who was acquired after a CIADRS participant's retirement to a survivor annuity only upon electing such annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which he or she may be entitled on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant. Exempts from taxation certain foreign areas allowances received by civilian officers and employees of the U.S. Government under the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Title V: NSA/DIA/Army Personnel Authorities Improvements - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include within foreign areas allowances which are exempt from taxation certain amounts received under specified Federal provisions with respect to activities of National Security Agency (NSA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) employees. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to: (1) expend funds and engage in certain commercial activities which shall not be subject to Federal laws and regulations applicable to the management of Federal agencies (upon certification by the Secretary of Defense that application of such provisions would risk compromise of authorized intelligence activities) in order to provide security for foreign intelligence collection by DOD; and (2) grant the use of the DOD reimbursement rate for military aircraft services provided by DOD to the CIA when such services are provided for activities related to national security objectives. Title VI: Federal Bureau of Investigation Enhanced Counterintelligence and Personnel Authorities - Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to require a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report or other information requested in connection with an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under specified conditions. Amends the Federal criminal code to provide the Director of the FBI with access to telephone toll and transactional records sought in connection with an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation under specified conditions. Title VII: General Provisions - Declares that appropriations authorized by this Act for Federal employee pay and benefits may be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law."
