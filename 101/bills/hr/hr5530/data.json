    "text": "Prescription Accountability Act of 1990 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require the Attorney General to implement a controlled substance accountable prescription system: (1) prohibiting a health care practitioner, other than a pharmacist, from prescribing certain controlled substances without writing the prescription on a form, provided by the Attorney General, which identifies such practitioner; and (2) requiring such practitioner to maintain a readily retrievable record of such transactions. Limits the number of times a prescription may be refilled without its renewal by such practitioner. Requires every person who dispenses such controlled substances to maintain a two-year record of such transactions, including the information contained on prescription forms, and provide information in such record to the State at least every two months. Makes the system inapplicable to drugs dispensed directly by a practitioner to a user and drugs dispensed by oral prescription in emergency situations. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to limit the use of system information to the enforcement of laws under the Medicaid program, title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, the Controlled Substances Act, or a State controlled substances Act. Requires States and the Attorney General to maintain active programs to process system information and investigate potential violations of law identified by such information."
