Directs the Commission to: (1) require that electronic copies of the Automated Tariff Filing and Information (ATFI) data base are made available in bulk in a timely and nondiscriminatory fashion; (2) assess fees for the service; (3) impose controls to limit remote access usage by any one person; and (4) allow information from the ATFI system to be used, resold, or disseminated without restriction and without payment of additional fees or royalties. Amends the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933 to remove, for ships not carrying passengers, the requirement that terms and conditions of the transportation be framed under glass and posted on board the vessel. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue a certificate of documentation for the coastwise trade or fisheries, or both, to four named vessels. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue, subject to certain conditions, a certificate of documentation for a named vessel to acquire, purchase, process, and transport fish and fish products in the fisheries of the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue a certificate of documentation for the coastwise trade to a named vessel."
