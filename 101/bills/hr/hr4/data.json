    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Clean Air Act Amendments of the 101st Congress- Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish a list of all categories and subcategories of major sources of listed air pollutants and simultaneously designate 50 percent of such categories for emission regulation. Requires that the remaining major stationary sources which present risks warranting regulation be designated for regulation within five years of this Act's enactment. Permits the Administrator to designate other stationary sources warranting regulation. Establishes a schedule for the promulgation of emission standards applicable to designated categories or subcategories of pollutant sources. Requires the Administrator, within seven years of promulgating emission standards for a source category, to evaluate public health risks remaining after application of such standards and make such standards more stringent if risks remain significant. Provides for variances from, and extensions of, the implementation of such standards. Prohibits the construction of a new source, modification of an existing source, or emissions from a major source which is subject to emission standards unless such activity is conducted in compliance with a permit issued by the Administration or an approved State permit program. Requires that such permits be for a fixed term not exceeding ten years. Directs the Administrator to establish an air toxics clearinghouse, control technology center, and risk information center to assist States in reducing air pollutant emissions. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States for the development and implementation of a permit program. Authorizes the President to exempt a source from compliance with emission standards if the means of complying are unavailable and the source is required for national security purposes."
