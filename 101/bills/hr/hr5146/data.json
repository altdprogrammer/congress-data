    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1990-07-23", 
    "text": "National Organ Transplant Program Extension Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, qualified organ procurement organizations and other nonprofit entities for special projects to increase the number of organ donors. (Current law authorizes the Secretary to make grants for the same purpose but makes no reference to contracts or to the recipients of the grants or the contractees.) Modifies matters the Secretary must consider in making grants. Replaces a requirement that an organ procurement organization (OPO) be of sufficient size to expect to procure organs from at least 50 donors a year with provisions requiring that an OPO be of sufficent size to assure maximum effectiveness in the procurement and equitable distribution of organs. Repeals provisions specifying the effective date of related provisions with regard to certain OPOs. Removes a requirement that funds for the establishment and operation of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network be made available from appropriations for fiscal years beginning after 1984. Replaces provisions prohibiting the Network from being engaged in any activity unrelated to organ procurement with provisions requiring that the Network be an entity with expertise in organ procurement. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out provisions mandating the establishment of a registry of voluntary bone marrow donors. Removes provisions setting October 1, 1988, as the deadline for establishing the registry. Prohibits making a grant or contract unless an application has been approved by the Secretary. Removes provisions specifying special considerations and priorities the Secretary must apply in considering grant applications. Allows special project grants to be made for three (currently, two) years. Removes provisions limiting them to a maximum dollar amount. Adds references to contracts to provisions relating to the amount of the grant or contract, advance payments, recordkeeping, and audits. Extends through FY 1993 the requirement that the Secretary maintain an identifiable administrative unit in the Public Health Service relating to organ procurement and donation. Requires that a report by the Secretary on the status of organ transplantation be published biennially rather than annually. Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to organ transplants."
