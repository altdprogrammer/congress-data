Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress by January 1, 1993, on the demonstration programs and the supply and characteristics of nurses trained under such programs. Amends the Medicare program to state that nursing education programs operated by corporations controlled by, or under common control with, the hospital may be treated as approved educational activities of such hospital."
