    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should ensure that the United Nations continues to pay sufficient attention to the United States and other major financial contributors in decision-making procedures on budgetary matters. Authorizes the President to withhold up to 20 percent of funds appropriated for the FY 1990 and 1991 U.S. assessed contribution to the United Nations or its specialized agencies if the President determines that the United Nations or any such agency: (1) has not continued to implement decision-making procedures in such a manner; (2) is not making progress toward the elimination of secondment in the United Nations Secretariat; or (3) is not implementing the 15 percent reduction in staff of the Secretariat and such reduction is not being equitably applied among the nationals on such staff. Requires the President to notify the Congress upon making any determination to withhold funding. Allows payments out of amounts authorized to be appropriated by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 to be made to the United Nations for assessed contributions for years prior to 1989 only for purposes agreed to by the President and the United Nations."
