Restores Federal recognition to specified California Indian tribal groups and their members whose relationship with the United States was terminated. Title II: Acknowledgment Procedures for California Indian Tribal Groups - California Indian Tribal Acknowledgment Procedures Act of 1990 - Authorizes any California Indian tribal group to apply for acknowledgment as an Indian tribe by submitting a petition containing specified information. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a review to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to be recognized as an Indian tribe. Grants petitioners the right to file a writ of mandamus in Federal court if the Secretary fails to take required actions concerning the petition. Requires petitions from parties to treaties to receive priority consideration. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to enable California Indian groups seeking acknowledgement to: (1) conduct the research necessary to substantiate petitions under this Act; and (2) maintain essential tribal governmental functions while a petition is under consideration. Prohibits grants from being made to a group whose petition was submitted under a different name and denied acknowledgment. Title III: Commission on Policies and Programs Affecting California Indians - Establishes the Commission on Policies and Programs Affecting California Indians to: (1) study the social and economic status of California Indians and the effectiveness of U.S. and California policies and programs that affect California Indians; (2) conduct public hearings on the subjects of such study; and (3) recommend specific action to the Congress with respect to the needs of the Indians for economic self-sufficiency, improved education and health, and a reduction in social problems. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary to accept real property for a California Indian tribal group recognized under this Act. Requires each California Indian tribal group recognized under this Act to submit current membership rolls to the Secretary. Directs each group to determine qualifications for inclusion on the membership roll. Requires the Secretary, upon request of a recognized California Indian tribal group, to develop and submit to the Congress an economic development plan for such group. Sets forth required provisions of the plan. Authorizes appropriations."
