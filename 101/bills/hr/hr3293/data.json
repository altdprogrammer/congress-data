    "text": "District of Columbia Budgetary and Legislative Efficiency Act of 1989 - Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to authorize appropriations for the annual Federal payment to the District of Columbia through FY 1991. Authorizes appropriations equal to 21 percent of the total tax revenue of the general fund of the District of Columbia as the annual Federal payment to the District of Columbia for subsequent fiscal years. Waives the period of congressional review required before District of Columbia Acts take effect. Revises the authority of the Congress to enact legislation that amends or repeals such Acts. Repeals certain rules governing congressional consideration of District of Columbia Council actions. Makes budget provisions that are disapproved by the Mayor, but reenacted by two-thirds of the Council or not resubmitted to the Council in a timely manner, part of the budget Act without their transmittal to the President. Eliminates the requirements that an Act of Congress: (1) approve the District of Columbia budget and supplements thereto before amounts are obligated or expended under such budget or its supplements; and (2) authorize District of Columbia employment positions before such positions are filled."
