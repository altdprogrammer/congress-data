Allows the State Planning Council, after October 1, 1990, to request review by the Governor of the designation of the designated State agency. Removes certain reporting requirements applicable to each State Planning Council and each Governor. Requires each State Planning Council to use information developed under specified provisions in developing the State plan. Requires that each State Planning Council serve as an advocate for all PWDDs by carrying out priority area activities.

Modifies requirements regarding the right of the system to access to all records of certain PWDDs.

Provides for the selection of members of a multimember governing board of a State system. Declares that: (1) the Act does not preclude a system from bringing a suit on behalf of PWDDs against a State or its agencies or instrumentalities; and (2) amounts received pursuant to such suits and used by the system are limited to furthering the purposes of provisions relating to protection and advocacy of individual rights for PWDDs and shall not be used to augment payments to legal contractors or to award personal bonuses. Directs the Secretary, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to pay allotments directly to any system which complies with such provisions relating to protection and advocacy. Authorizes appropriations for allotments under such provisions. Adds to the list of purposes of grants to university affiliated programs (UAPs) that of training personnel to address the needs of PWDDs in the areas of positive behavior management, assistive technology, and programs in other areas of national significance. Requires grants to UAPs to be: (1) in a specified amount, subject to waiver and exception; (2) awarded on a competitive basis; and (3) awarded for a period of three years. Directs the Secretary to require technical and qualitative review of grant applications by peer review groups as established under existing provisions and using specified criteria. Prohibits using the grants for administrative expenses or to carry out provisions relating to grants to UAPs to assist in the administration and operation of UAPs.

Requires that recipient UAPs establish consumer advisory committees. Requires UAPs, in order to be eligible for funding under these provisions, to have: (1) been operated for at least one year; and (2) demonstrated the capacity to develop an effective training program during the first year the program is operated. Extends through FY 1993 the requirement that the Secretary consider four applications for grants for UAPs or satellite centers for each fiscal year in addition to those receiving grants for the preceding fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to solicit and allows the Secretary to approve applications that encompass multiple universities. Requires such UAPs and centers to be geographically distributed so as to serve States that are underserved as of October 29, 1990. Allows the Secretary, in certain circumstances, to consider applications from States already served by a UAP or center. Adds references to on-site visits and inspections to provisions requiring technical and qualitative peer review. Requires such peer review to be coordinated with certain other peer review. Authorizes appropriations for UAPs. Adds references to improving supportive living and quality of life opportunities which enhance recreation, leisure, and fitness to the list of projects of national significance.
