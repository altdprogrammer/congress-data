Directs the Secretary to undertake appraisal investigations to identify opportunities and make recommendations for wastewater reclamation and reuse. Authorizes the Secretary to participate with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local authorities in studies to determine the feasibility of wastewater reclamation and reuse projects recommended. Limits the Federal share of the cost of such studies to 50 percent, except when the Secretary determines that due to financial hardship the non-Federal participant in such study is unable to contribute at least 50 percent of such costs. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a study to assess the feasibility of a comprehensive wastewater reclamation and reuse system for southern California. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the city of San Diego, California, to conduct a feasibility study of the potential for development of demonstration facilities to reclaim and reuse wastewater in the San Diego metropolitan service area. Limits the Federal share of costs of such studies to 50 percent. Authorizes appropriations. Requires congressional reports for such investigations and studies. Title II: Reclamation Groundwater Study - Directs the Secretary: (1) acting through the Bureau of Reclamation and the Geological Survey, to conduct an investigation and analysis of the impacts of existing Bureau projects on the quality and quantity of groundwater resources; and (2) to prepare a reclamation groundwater management and technical assistance study concerning such resources. Requires the Secretary to consult with Governors of affected States in conducting such investigation, analysis, and study. Requires a congressional report concerning such study."
