Establishes criminal penalties for the manufacture, assembly, possession, or sale of any voice-actuated recorder in interstate or foreign commerce, unless such recorder has: (1) a beep-tone designed to be audible to a person whose communications are recorded; and (2) a warning label indicating the prohibition on surreptitious interception of communications and the possession of devices primarily useful for such interception. Authorizes recovery of civil damages from persons or entities which engage in the manufacture, assembly, possession, or sale of such devices which fail to have a beep-tone and warning label."
