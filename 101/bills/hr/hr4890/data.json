    "text": "Title I: Emergency Crop Loss Assistance - Subtitle A: Annual Crops - Extends disaster crop loss assistance through the 1990 crop year for wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, soybeans, and other nonprogram crops. Extends crop quality reduction disaster assistance through the 1990 crop year. Reduces disaster assistance payments in relation to Federal crop insurance payments. Requires producers to obtain Federal crop insurance for 1991 in order to be eligible for disaster payments and other specified assistance for 1990 crop losses. Sets forth exempted circumstances. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to announce within a specified time the conditions for establishing a 1990 farm yield for forage-use-crops. Limits assistance under this Act to $100,000. Authorizes the substitution of crop insurance program yields for 1990 disaster assistance eligibility purposes. Subtitle B: Orchards - Provides disaster assistance (up to $25,000 or an equivalent value in seedlings) to orchardists who suffered qualifying tree losses as a result of 1990 freeze, earthquake, or related condition. Expresses the sense of the Congress that Federal crop insurance should be made available to all orchard crops. Subtitle C: Forest Crops - Provides disaster assistance (up to $25,000 or an equivalent in seedlings) to commercial tree farmers who suffered qualifying tree seedling losses as a result of 1990 drought, earthquake, or related condition. Subtitle D: Additional Assistance - Prohibits the Secretary from reducing rental payments to an owner or operator who hays or grazes livestock during the 1990 crop year on land subject to a conservation reserve program contract to the extent that such owner or operator carries out and pays for specified additional conservation practices. Subtitle E: Administrative Provisions - Makes a person with qualifying annual gross income (as defined by this Act) in excess of $2,000,000 ineligible for assistance under this Act. Title II: Disaster Credit and Forbearance - Makes producers who suffered 1990 crop losses eligible for emergency loans even if they had crop insurance. Directs the Secretary to make 1991 direct and guaranteed farm operating loans (including funds from the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund) available to producers who suffered 1990 crop losses due to moisture, freeze, or related condition, and 1988 or 1990 crop losses due to drought or related condition. Title III: Rural Businesses - Directs the Secretary to provide loan guarantees through the Rural Development Insurance Fund to rural business enterprises (including Indian tribes) which have suffered disaster damage in 1989 or 1990. Limits: (1) individual guarantees to the lesser of 90 percent of principal and interest or $2,500,000; and (2) aggregate guarantees to $200,000,000. Title IV: General Provisions - Amends the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 to base the determination of the 1989 harvestable amount of sugarcane on the quantity of recoverable sugar."
