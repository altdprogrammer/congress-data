Forbids agents from knowingly selling policies that duplicate a beneficiary's current coverage in any way. Requires States to establish a process for approving or disapproving proposed policy premium increases. Requires that Medicare supplemental insurance policies submit, at least annually, premium and benefit information to the State in which they are issued. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide matching grants to States which: (1) meet specified requirements for the establishment of a toll-free telephone hotlines providing individuals with Medicare supplemental insurance information; and (2) disseminate an educational brochure which summarizes the hotline's features."
