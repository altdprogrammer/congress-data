Directs the Secretary, within three years after first making a grant under this Act, to report to the Congress on such demonstration projects, including any recommendations on the establishment of a permanent program. Makes local public libraries which receive such demonstration grants ineligible during the same fiscal year to receive certain other grants for support of library literacy programs. Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to require the Director of the ACTION Agency, in making grants under the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, to give priority to programs of national significance, such as intergenerational library literacy programs."
