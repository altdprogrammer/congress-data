    "text": "Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for FY 1990 for the United States International Trade Commission. Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for FY 1990 for the United States Customs Service for: (1) noncommercial and commercial operations; and (2) the air interdiction program. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for the Office of the United States Trade Representative for FY 1990, out of which only a specified amount may be used for entertainment and representation expenses. Declares that the Commissioner of Customs shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Commissioner to transmit to the Congress a report on: (1) the value of the on-hand inventory of seized property (under the forfeiture provisions of such Act) as of the last day of the previous fiscal year; and (2) the sources of gross receipts of, and gross disbursements from, the Customs Forfeiture Fund during the previous fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the appropriate customs officer to publish for at least three successive weeks, notice of the seizure of monetary instruments and the intention to forfeit and sell them. Requires the Commissioner to report to the Congress on the total dollar value of uncontested seizures of monetary instruments valued over $100,000 which have not been deposited into the Fund within 120 days of seizure. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer forfeited property, including non-jet aircraft, to the Civil Air Patrol."
