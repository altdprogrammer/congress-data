    "text": "Federal Reduction-in-Force Assistance Act of 1990 - Requires Federal agencies to inform their employees of: (1) the potential for, and the likely scope of, a major reduction in force at least 180 days in advance; and (2) their actual dates of separation from service due to such a reduction in force at least 120 days in advance. Allows such notice to be waived if the President certifies to appropriate congressional committees that notice is not feasible due to legitimate unforeseen circumstances. Provides that whenever a Federal agency determines that it must implement a major reduction in force at any of its facilities, the head of the agency shall: (1) use all legal means to minimize the number of involuntary separations necessary; and (2) prepare an analysis relating to whether to request permission from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to offer early retirement to its employees. Allows such an analysis to be waived for a particular reduction in force under the same procedure for waiving notifications of a reduction in force. Requires Federal agencies to complete such an analysis and report to OPM on whether or not to request authority to provide early retirement at least 180 days prior to a major reduction in force. Requires the interagency and intra-agency displaced employee lists and programs of all Federal agencies to allow persons at least 72 hours to consider job offers before terminating such persons from the particular list or program. Provides that such programs shall not prohibit employees from registering and using such programs once employees have received such notifications, except that employees may be disqualified from the programs for violating program rules. Prohibits a reduction in the annuities of retired Federal employees temporarily employed at a facility which: (1) OPM has certified as undergoing a major reduction in force; (2) is in danger of not performing its mission because workers are leaving before their planned duties; and (3) cannot reasonably hire adequate non-annuitant temporary employees. Terminates such prohibition once OPM determines that nonannuitant employees can be hired or such a reduction has been completed."
