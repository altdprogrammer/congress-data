    "text": "SSI Community Living Amendments of 1989 - Title I: Income Supplements - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994 which shall be allotted among States on the basis of each State's population and which States shall use to provide SSI-eligible individuals with income to obtain necessary and regular assistance with daily living activities in a natural residential setting. Sets the Federal share of the program's cost at 50 percent. Requires States to develop systems to: (1) determine and, every six months, review an individual's need for such income; (2) target such income to individuals living in a natural residential setting with four or fewer individuals and to individuals having the greatest need for regular assistance; and (3) oversee the provision of such assistance. Sets forth data collection and reporting requirements. Prohibits the receipt of such income from affecting an individual's eligibility for assistance under specified programs. Title II: Quality Assurance for SSI Recipients in Group Living Arrangements - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide States with information, on at least a quarterly basis, identifying any place (excluding institutionalized care facilities) in which three or more SSI recipients reside. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with any State under which the State assists the Secretary in carrying out responsibilities related to the payment of benefits to representative payees under the SSI program and title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, and the Secretary covers State costs in carrying out such agreement. Permits the Secretary to condition such agreement on States imposing certain standards on representative payees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994 for grants to States which agree to use such funds to establish procedures for identifying and investigating possible unlicensed and substandard SSI recipient group living arrangements. Gives States 30 days after determining that an SSI recipient is living in such an arrangement to take action to ensure that the facility meets such standards or find an alternative living arrangement for such individual. Permits States to use grants to provide services to other groups of low income aged, blind, or disabled individuals in particular need of obtaining housing assistance and other related services or use such grants to develop and enforce standards for any category of institutions, foster homes, or group living arrangements in which a significant number of SSI recipients reside or are likely to reside. Apportions grant funds among States on the basis of each State's share of SSI recipients. Title III: Effective Date - Makes the Act's amendments effective on October 1, 1990."
