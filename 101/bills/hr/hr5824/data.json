    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State to enforce laws collecting fees in connection with the treatment and disposal within such State of solid waste generated in another State. Permits a State, after the submission to the Administrator of a certification under this Act, to enforce laws regulating the treatment and disposal of solid waste within the State. Authorizes any State which has adopted a 20-year solid waste management plan to submit a certification to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on the solid waste treatment and disposal capacity of the State. Sets forth minimum requirements of the plan. Permits the Governor of each State which has adopted a 20-year management plan to certify to the Administrator that the State has adequate capacity to manage all solid waste generated in the State or received from other States for the following 60-month period. Exempts specified types of waste from regulation under this Act. Grants congressional approval to agreements or compacts entered into by two or more States for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance for solid waste management. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate regulations exempting waste types or recycling practices from the authority granted to States under this Act if such action promotes the development of an interstate market for recyclable materials or is necessary to promote environmentally sound waste disposal practices."
