Makes an exception to immunity from attachment where the judgment relates to a claim for which the foreign state is not immune by virtue of such provision, regardless of whether the property is or was connected with the activity, act, or omission upon which the claim is based. Specifies that property located in the United States of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity in this country shall not be immune from attachment or execution if the judgment relates to a claim for which the agency or instrumentality is not immune, regardless of whether the property is or was involved in the activity, act, or omission upon which the claim is based."
