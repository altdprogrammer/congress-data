Describes elements required to be included. Requires that, within 24 months of establishment of the standards and notwithstanding other laws: (1) each sponsor of a health benefit plan comply with the standards; and (2) each State adopt the standards and assume responsibility for enforcing them through assessment of penalties. Requires States to notify the Secretary when they have done so and the Secretary to certify that they have adopted the standards and assumed such responsibility. Prohibits the Secretary, in the case of a State that must enact legislation in order to adopt and assume responsibility for enforcing the standards, from refusing to certify a State before the close of the first regular session of the State legislature that begins after establishment of the standards. Directs the Secretary to withdraw a State's certification for stated reasons. Provides, with regard to a sponsor who does not comply with the standards, for civil monetary penalties, subject to exception, and for liability to individuals for damages."
