Modifies the boundaries of such Forest to exclude such lands. Declares that such lands shall be deemed to have been held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the San Carlos Apache Tribe since December 14, 1872. Transfers administration over such lands to the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary to acquire permanent improvements on the grazing allotment on such trust lands if offered to the Secretary within 180 days after enactment of this Act.
