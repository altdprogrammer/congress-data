Limits the percentage of nonrubber footwear that may be imported for such estimated domestic consumption during certain 12-month periods over five years. Directs the Secretary to allocate such import limitations among foreign countries, taking into consideration: (1) average levels of imports for the period 1978 through 1982; (2) findings of unfair trade practices with respect to nonrubber footwear products; (3) recent market trends; and (4) such other considerations as appropriate."
