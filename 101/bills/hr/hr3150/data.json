Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 to extend the Rural Health Care Transition Grant Program through FY 1992, and permit hospitals to use grants received under such Program to develop a plan for converting to rural primary care hospitals or to develop a rural health network, if located in a State participating in the preceding demonstration program.

Covers inpatient rural primary care hospital services. Directs the Secretary to make recommendations to the Congress and the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission by October 1, 1990, regarding the establishment of a single national rate, rather than using large urban, other urban, and rural rates, in calculating payments for inpatient hospital services, with adjustments in such rate reflecting cost variations within a DRG.

Reduces payments for radiology services.

Requires the Secretary to establish a relative value guide for use in all carrier localities in making payment for physician anesthesia services. Delays the Medicare economic index adjustment to payments for physicians' services from January 1, 1990, to April 1, 1990. Extends Medicare physician and supplier participation agreements for which a termination is not requested before December 31, 1989, through March 31, 1990. Limits increases in the Medicare economic index for the first three months of 1990 to: (1) zero percent for radiology services, anesthesia services and other physicians' services on a specified list; and (2) two percent for other physicians' services, excepting primary care services.
