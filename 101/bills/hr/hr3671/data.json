Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to institute a program for the operational evaluation of the collision avoidance system known as TCAS-II. Requires the Administrator to consider the compatibility of the installation schedule of the airborne low-altitude wind shear equipment with the installation of the TCAS-II system. Revises property conveyance restrictions placed upon certain property transferred to the Peninsula Airport Commission, Virginia, to: (1) increase the total acreage for which the Secretary of Transportation may grant releases; and (2) repeal the prohibition on the Commission's conveyance of any property interest to persons other than the City of Newport News, Virginia. Revises the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 with respect to the disposal of airport lands and use of the proceeds to authorize their reinvestment in other eligible airport improvement projects or within the national airport system."
