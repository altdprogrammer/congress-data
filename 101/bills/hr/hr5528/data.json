    "text": "International Medical Graduate Equity Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the establishment of a clearinghouse that, upon the request of an individual applying for a license as a physician in the United States, would: (1) maintain and verify documents relating to the applicant's educational background and credentials; and (2) provide information in the clearinghouse to medical licensing boards and related entities. States that the clearinghouse will not be operated within the Federal Government. Allows it to impose fees to cover some or all of its operational costs. Requires the Secretary to obtain information on a periodic basis from the physician licensing authority of at least ten States with respect to license applications and periodically report on such information to the Congress. Deems it unlawful for a graduate medical residency training program to deny a medical residency to a qualified individual who graduated from a foreign medical school if such residency cannot be filled by the graduate of a medical school in the United States or Canada."
