Outlines provisions concerning the operation, maintenance, use, and the El Paso County Water Improvement District's share of the costs of the canal extension. Repeals a previous construction authorization. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on findings from a study to determine the likelihood and extent of any damage to property adjacent to the American Canal which would be caused by subsidence related to the Canal extension.
