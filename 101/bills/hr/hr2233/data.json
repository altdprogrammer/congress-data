    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the Federal excise tax on gasoline (except gasohol) from 9.1 cents to 19.1 cents per gallon. Earmarks the increase as follows: (1) three cents to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for transfer to the Mass Transit Account (thereby increasing the total HTF financing rate to 12 cents per gallon); and (2) seven cents to fund deficit reduction. Suspends this deficit reduction rate in any year following a fiscal year when the Federal Government had no deficit."
