States that no person may be sentenced to death under this Act unless the jury (or judge if the accused waives a jury) finds (in a separate sentencing proceeding): (1) at least one aggravating factor to exist; and (2) that any extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighed by aggravating circumstances. Sets forth the aggravating factors to be considered, including the knowing endangerment of national security."
