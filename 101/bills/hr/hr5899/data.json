    "text": "Breast Cancer Screening Safety Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require certification in order for a facility to perform mammograms or mammography services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue and renew certificates for up to two years. Requires, in order to be certified, that a facility be accredited. Allows the Secretary to approve a private nonprofit organization to be an accreditation body which meets certain requirements, including inspecting facilities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish standards for facilities to assure the safety and accuracy of mammography; (2) specify organizations eligible to certify individuals to perform radiological procedures; (3) specify boards eligible to certify individuals to interpret screening mammograms; and (4) establish standards regarding the qualifications for individuals to interpret screening mammograms. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct annual announced and unannounced inspections of certified facilities. Provides for: (1) intermediate sanctions for certain violations; (2) suspension, revocation, and limitation of certificates; and (3) injunctions. Requires fees for certificate issuance and renewal, and for inspections, sufficient to cover costs. Requires annual publication of a list of facilities convicted of fraud and abuse, false billings, or kickbacks, facilities that have had certificates revoked, suspended, or limited, and facilities that have been the subject of a sanction or other similar matters. Allows the Secretary to exempt facilities in a State with more stringent requirements from compliance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a Mammography Registry to maintain information on the former mammograms of women."
