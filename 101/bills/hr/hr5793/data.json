Requires the Secretary, in cases in which a claim is denied, the claimant files a Notice of Disagreement with the Secretary, and the Secretary does not certify the case to the Board of Veterans' Appeals within 180 days of the date of the filing of the Notice, to pay the benefits for which the claim was filed. Directs the Secretary, whenever the Board or the Court of Veterans Appeals remands a case to the Secretary involving a claim for benefits, to pay benefits in accordance with the claim retroactive to the first day of the first month after the month in which the decision appealed from was made. Requires the Secretary, whenever a veteran is determined to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation and counseling services and is not interviewed by the Secretary within 60 days of such determination, to arrange for such services to be provided through an accredited agency on a fee basis. Sets forth provisions applying this Act to claims filed before this Act's enactment."
