States that such source may not be limited to voter registration lists or lists of actual voters, but may include social security records and Federal income tax returns. Modifies the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code accordingly. Prohibits a State from drawing the names of prospective jurors exclusively from voter registration lists or lists of actual voters. Requires such State to use other sources such as motor vehicle license and registration records, lists of utility customers, and State or local income tax returns."
