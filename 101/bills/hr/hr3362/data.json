    "text": "Global Forest Emergency Act - Establishes a national policy of no net loss of forests within the United States and its territories. Makes forest conservation and the sustainable use of forests, domestically and internationally, a national priority. Requires: (1) the President to declare a national forest emergency and work with other nations and international organizations for similar declarations; (2) all U.S. agencies to take all actions within their authority to conserve forests and support forest regeneration and restoration as appropriate to their mission; and (3) the Council on Environmental Quality to establish national objectives to implement and promote such policy. Directs specified U.S. officials to work with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and other international bodies toward a global survey of the world's forests and forest resources to assess the extent, status, and projected trends of the world's forests. Requires such survey to use the best available technology, including satellite imagery. Directs the Agency for International Development and the Forest Service to work together to support and provide technical assistance for national-level forest inventories around the world. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, through the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET), to prepare a comprehensive research program in forest ecology to be known as the Endangered Forest Research Initiative. Specifies that such Initiative shall include: (1) research roles for specified agencies; (2) cooperative scientific programs with other nations; (3) research toward understanding the role of forests in ameliorating climate change, in preserving biological diversity, in preventing erosion, and in protecting watersheds; and (4) development of technologies and methodology for sustained yield forestry and forest restoration and development of indigenous crops in sustained yield agroforestry. Requires the FCCSET: (1) in preparing the Initiative, to pay particular attention to the recommendations of specified National Academy of Sciences reports; (2) to coordinate with the International Union of Forest Research Associations and other domestic and international organizations as appropriate in developing the Initiative; and (3) to submit the Initiative to the Congress within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires that the recommendations contained in the Initiative be represented in the annual budget requests of the participating agencies and departments. Directs the President to extend an invitation to the Government of Japan to participate in a joint United States-Japan Commission on Global Forest Restoration which shall provide financial and technical assistance to nations, international organizations, local and national nongovernmental organizations, and industry to: (1) develop, initiate, and support a global forest restoration program; (2) seek to implement a global policy of no net loss of forest through conservation of existing forests, natural regeneration, and planting of additional trees; and (3) include training and education activities in forest conservation and restoration techniques. Specifies the U.S. members of the Commission."
