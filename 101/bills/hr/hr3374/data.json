Requires the issuance of a final administrative order before imposition of illegal hiring criminal sanctions on an employer. Requires immigration emergency funds to be made available to localities affected by increased asylum applicants. Title II: Provisions Relating to Title II of IRCA (Legalization) - Repeals the one-year filing deadline for an alien seeking to adjust from temporary to permanent resident status under the legalization program. Revises provisions with regard to a nonimmigrant's legalization filing. Permits the courts to extend the legalization filing period for up to six months in an action challenging related rules, policies, or practices. Prohibits the deportation of spouses and children of legalized aliens and certain alien minors (and authorizes employment) in certain deportation circumstances. Amends the Immigration Reform and Control Act to expand the use of State legalization assistance grants to include: (1) employment training; (2) legalization outreach; and (3) employment discrimination outreach and enforcement."
