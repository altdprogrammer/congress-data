Requires the Secretary to establish the New Market Task Force to develop foreign market development strategy, coordinate and disseminate information, and advise and educate such entities concerning agricultural export markets and domestic trade programs. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to require the Secretary for FY 1991 through 1995 to use a specified amount of funds, or commodities owned by, the Commodity Credit Corporation for targeted export activities designed to develop new foreign markets for agricultural products. Requires the Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service to report to specified congressional committees: (1) any recommendations about proposed locations of New Agricultural Trade Offices and proposed fund uses; (2) estimated personnel and appropriations needs of such offices; and (3) an analysis of the Service's hiring ceiling. Requires the Secretary of State to permit the Agricultural Trade Offices to employ necessary personnel even if their employment exceeds embassy personnel limits. Requires the Secretary to establish a Processed Products Export Enhancement Program providing agricultural commodities acquired by the Corporation to U.S. exporters, users, and processors and foreign purchasers at no cost. Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to extend the authority of the Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund through October 1, 1995."
