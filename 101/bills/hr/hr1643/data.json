    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-03-23", 
    "text": "Nuclear Weapons Production Health and Safety Act of 1989 - Title I: Nuclear Weapons Production Health and Safety Board - Establishes as an independent agency in the executive branch the Nuclear Weapons Production Health and Safety Board (the Board) whose function is to establish environmental protection and public and occupational health and safety standards for Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear facilities. Empowers the Board to investigate: (1) any event at a DOE nuclear facility posing a threat to the environment or to the public health and safety; and (2) nuclear materials transportation to and from such facilities which may pose threats. Directs the Board periodically to review the design and operation of such nuclear facilities to determine ways to enhance environmental and public protection. Requires the Board to report to the Congress and the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) after each review and investigation with recommendations for improved safety measures. Requires the Board to maintain an onsite investigatory and review staff at each facility. Authorizes the Board to issue subpoenas and administrative orders compelling compliance with its standards and with Federal and State standards. Requires the Board to submit a written notice to the Secretary to abate any facility activity which presents imminent and substantial danger to the environment and public health. Sets forth civil penalties for non-compliance with the Board's administrative orders. Requires the Board to establish procedures for petitions by citizens for Board action with respect to matters within its purview. Authorizes the Board to enter into agreements with the States providing for discontinuance of the Board's regulatory authority during the period in which the State assumes such authority. Requires the Board to: (1) periodically review such agreements to ensure compliance with this Act; and (2) make grants to an agreement State to cover the costs of program implementation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994. Terminates the Board and the requirements of this title after six years. Requires the Board to report to the Congress five years after enactment of this Act regarding the efficacy of its oversight and regulatory activities. Title II: Licenses for Department of Energy Nuclear Facilities - Prohibits any DOE facility from commencing operations unless it has received a license from the Board issued pursuant to environmental and public health safety standards compatible with this Act. Title III: EPA Authority - Amends the Clean Water Act to include within the definition of \"pollutant\" any byproduct, source, and special nuclear material. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to exclude source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials from the definition of \"solid waste\" unless such materials are a part of any mixture or combination comprising a solid waste. Title IV: Radiation Research Reorganization Act of 1989 - Radiation Research Reorganization Act of 1989 - Transfers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority of the Secretary of Energy to conduct epidemiological studies of the effects of radiation. Mandates that such authority be exercised through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control with respect to health effects of radiation in places of employment. Establishes an advisory panel to be appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to advise such Secretary in implementing the epidemiological studies. Title V: Department of Energy Safety and Environmental Responsibility - Transfers to the DOE Assistant Secretary assigned to environmental responsibilities and functions all functions and responsibilities relating to nuclear facilities cleanup and compliance with safety and environmental standards. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to establish within DOE a Chief Safety Officer, appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, who shall not be under the control or supervision of any other DOE officer, to: (1) advise the Secretary regarding DOE safety management; (2) monitor DOE and contractor safety performance; (3) enforce safety policies; (4) advise the Secretary on DOE budget allocations for safety measures; and (5) report annually to the Congress on DOE safety programs."
