    "text": "Amends Federal provisions concerning enforcement procedures for the reemployment rights of veterans having successfully completed their required military service to authorize a veteran claiming to be entitled to such benefits to file a charge against a private employer, a State, or a political subdivision with the Department of Labor. Directs the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training to serve notice on such employer of the filing of charges and to conduct an appropriate investigation. Requires the Assistant Secretary, upon finding that the charges are true, to attempt to correct the violation by informal methods of conciliation or agreement, and if informal methods fail, to refer the case to the Attorney General for a civil action."
