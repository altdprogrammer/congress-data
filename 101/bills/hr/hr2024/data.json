Defines compensable injury as death, personal injury, or forced labor, forced march, or internment. Gives the Secretary of the Interior the authority to render final decisions concerning claims filed under this Act. Sets forth eligibility criteria. Establishes the Guam Claims Fund. Authorizes appropriations and appropriates $4,000,000 to the Fund. Requires the Secretary to report annually on the status of the Fund and to submit a final report once all the eligible claims have been paid. States that the decision of the Secretary in allowing or denying any claim is final and not subject to review by any other entity."
