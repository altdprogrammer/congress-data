    "text": "Global Environment Research and Policy Act of 1989 - Title I: National Global Change Research Plan - Establishes a Committee on Earth Sciences within the Executive Office of the President. Directs the Committee to develop a National Global Change Research Plan for a ten-year national research program on the processes and factors which contribute to global change, including research on increases of global sea levels. Requires that such Plan allocate research responsibilities among Federal agencies. Requires that such Plan be submitted to the Congress within one year of this Act's enactment and reviewed and revised, as necessary, at least once every three years. Directs the Committee to: (1) oversee implementation of the Plan; (2) coordinate global change research and assessment activities among Federal agencies; (3) work with the National Research Council and other groups conducting such activities; (4) promote consistent, efficient, and compatible transfer and use of research data; and (5) cooperate with the Secretary of State in providing U.S. representation at international governmental meetings on global change. Requires each Federal agency to submit a report identifying each element of its proposed global change activities to the President and the Committee when it submits its appropriations request to the President. Directs the President to give the Council an opportunity to review and comment on the budget estimate for each agency in the context of the Plan before submitting the annual budget to the Congress, and identify in such budget the portion of each agency's annual budget that is allocated to each element of that agency's global change activities. Sets forth Committee reporting requirements. Title II: Global Change Policy - Requires the Council on Environmental Quality to advise the President on domestic and international policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government related to global change. Sets forth reporting requirements, including the requirement that the Council develop and submit to the Congress and the President, within five years of this Act's enactment, a comprehensive program to abate, mitigate, and adapt to the impacts of global change. Requires that such program be updated periodically to incorporate the results of Plan research. Title III: Miscellaneous - Directs the Council to issue regulations to require Federal agencies to ensure: (1) the consideration of the significant effects of major actions on the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any nation; and (2) the formal assessment of such actions on the environment outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Authorizes appropriations to the Council for FY 1990 and 1991. Title IV: International Programs in Global Change Research - Directs the Secretary of State to initiate discussions with other nations leading toward: (1) an international protocol in global change research and assessment; and (2) an international research protocol for environmentally safe energy technologies."
