    "text": "Senior Executive Service Improvements Act - Amends the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to entitle Senior Executive Service (SES) members who are subject to a non-performance related reduction in pay to certain notice and hearing requirements, including the right to appeal such reduction to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Grants the Board the authority to mitigate adverse actions against SES members in the same manner as provided for other Federal employees in the Civil Service. Revises the current 15-day advance notice requirement for a reduction in the rate of basic pay of any career appointee to provide that such requirement applies only to a SES career appointee who fails to complete the prescribed probationary period or who was not in the Civil Service before appointment to the SES. Prohibits Federal employees in the Civil Service who have at least five years of continuous service and who are appointed to the SES as a career appointee or who hold a position which is converted to a career reserved position in the SES from taking a cut in pay."
