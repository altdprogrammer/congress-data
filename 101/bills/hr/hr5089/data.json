Limits the pay of individuals receiving such an exemption to the maximum rate of basic pay then currently payable for GS-12 of the General Schedule. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to study and report to the Congress on whether any ongoing or recurring shortages of Government employees could be alleviated by enlisting the temporary services of retired Federal civilian or military personnel."
