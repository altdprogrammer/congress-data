Authorizes the Secretary to require that all participants in the pilot program be referred to a non-Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility for specific care through the direction of a local Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on a plan for the implementation of the pilot program within 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Terminates the authority of the Secretary with respect to the pilot program when a new Department medical facility to serve the south-central Florida area is opened. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the operation of the program and on the feasibility of applying similar programs in other areas of the United States which are not served by a Department medical facility."
