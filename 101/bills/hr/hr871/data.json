    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to charter a National Packaging Institute to promote and establish voluntary national packaging standards, with due regard to consumer product cost and convenience, to: (1) minimize the quantity of packaging material which enters the Nation's solid waste management system; (2) minimize the consumption of scarce natural resources; (3) maximize the recycling and reuse of packaging materials; (4) reduce litter; and (5) assure that human health and the environment will not be adversely affected as the result of the use or disposal of such packaging materials. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct a program of public information and education, including public service advertising, to encourage consumer understanding of the benefits of purchasing packaging meeting such standards. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994."
