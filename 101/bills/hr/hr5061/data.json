    "text": "Campaign Limitations and Election Accountability Now Act of 1990 - Title I: Contribution Reforms - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) decrease from $5,000 to $1,000 the amount a multicandidate political committee may contribute to a candidate and the candidate's political committee; (2) prohibit intermediaries from delivering or arranging to have delivered contributions from more than two employees of the same employer or members of the same trade association, membership organization, or labor organization; (3) prohibit lobbyists from acting as intermediaries with respect to a contribution to a candidate for Federal office; (4) prohibit a political committee that is not an authorized committee of a candidate for Federal office and is not a political committee of a political party from making contributions, or otherwise transferring funds, to any other such committee; (5) direct the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to promulgate regulations to limit contributions to any legal defense fund established by or on behalf of a holder of Federal office to $1,000, to prohibit lobbyists from serving as intermediaries in connection with any such contribution, and to require any such office holder to disclose such contributions as is required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978; and (6) ban the use of soft money (any amount raised or contributed outside of source restrictions, contribution limits, and disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971) to influence any Federal election. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits for contributors to congressional campaign candidates. Limits such credits to an annual total of $100 for individual congressional campaign contributions. Prohibits credits if they are transmitted to candidates or their campaign committees through any intermediary. Prohibits such credits from being provided to any estate or trust. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) require disclosure in the reports filed by political committee treasurers with the FEC of debt settlement and loan security agreements; (2) include as a contribution any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person to draft or encourage a clearly identified individual as a candidate for Federal office; (3) treat such a contribution as a candidate contribution whether or not the individual becomes a candidate; (4) require a candidate for Federal office to sign and attest to FEC reports of principal campaign committees of candidates for the House or Senate; (5) prohibit an incumbent in, or a candidate for, Federal office from establishing, maintaining, or controlling a political committee, other than an authorized committee of the candidate or a committee of a political party; (6) revise restrictions on the use of contributed amounts to require candidates for Federal office to pay their campaign debts within 90 days after the general election and to distribute the remaining balance to charitable organizations, political party committees, and to any person for any lawful purpose; and (7) prohibit candidates for the House or Senate from accepting less than 50 percent of their campaign contributions from their constituents. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a Federal candidate or office holder from soliciting funds to, or receiving funds on behalf of, any Federal or non-Federal candidate or political committee: (1) which are to be expended in connection with any Federal election unless such funds are subject to that Act; or (2) which are to be expended in connection with any election other than a Federal election unless such funds are not in excess of amounts permitted with respect to Federal candidates and political committees under that Act, or are not from sources prohibited by that Act with respect to Federal elections. Provides that the appearance or participation by a candidate or individual in any activity conducted by a committee of a political party or a candidate for other than Federal office shall not be treated as such a solicitation if: (1) such appearance or participation is otherwise legal; and (2) such candidate or individual does not solicit or receive, or make expenditures from, any funds resulting from such activity. Amends postal law to require House Members to annually register their franked mass mailing with the Clerk of the House who is required to make available for public inspection a copy of such mail matter."
