Requires an agency, if an employee gives notice of intent to retire, to: (1) inform such employee of the agency retirement counselor and applicable seminars; and (2) begin processing the retirement application so that all required information is submitted to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) not later than 30 days after the employee's separation or application for annuity, whichever is later. Requires OPM to compile quarterly information on the timeliness and accuracy of agencies in submitting retirement applications. Requires agencies to prepare corrective action plans to achieve compliance. Directs OPM to report to the Congress annually on such compliance. Requires the agency retirement counselor to conduct seminars at least twice a year."
