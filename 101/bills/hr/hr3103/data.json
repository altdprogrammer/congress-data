    "text": "Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) to remove from provisions specifying the total allowable level of foreign fishing references to the annual fishing level for the harvesting season. Makes changes to provisions regulating: (1) the procedure for processing applications for permits under governing international fishery agreements; and (2) the imposition and disposition of permit fees. Allows Fishery Management Council staff members to be reimbursed for actual expenses. Requires fishery management plans to specify the pertinent data that must be submitted with respect to foreign fishing. Removes provisions prohibiting certain fees paid by fishing vessels of the United States for certain fishing permits from exceeding the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permits. Requires an application by a foreign fishing vessel to engage in fish processing within the internal waters of a State to specify the species to be processed. Requires the Governor of a State to consult with the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council on specified matters before granting permission for a foreign vessel to engage in processing within State waters. Makes it unlawful for any person to forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with any observer on board a vessel under the Magnuson Act. Includes such acts in the list of acts constituting criminal offenses under the Act. Increases the maximum civil penalties for violations of the Act. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury to pay, from sums received as fines, penalties, or forfeitures for violations of the Magnuson Act: (1) claims of parties in interest to property disposed of under specified provisions of Federal customs law; and (2) reimbursement to any Federal or State agency for services performed, or personnel, equipment, or facilities utilized under any agreement with the Secretary of Commerce under enforcement provisions of the Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Magnuson Act for FY 1990 through 1992."
