    "text": "Shareholder Protection Act of 1990 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require that the beneficial owner of a short position of more than five percent of any class of certain equity securities disclose specified identifying information to: (1) the issuer of the securities; (2) each exchange where the securities are traded; (3) each registered securities association; and (4) the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Exempts from such disclosure requirements market makers and specialists if the short sales they effect are transacted solely for bona fide market-making purposes. Prohibits the use of an interdealer quotation system to execute transactions relating to puts, calls, straddles, or options in violations of SEC regulations. Grants the issuer of registered securities standing to bring legal action for equitable relief against violators of SEC regulations concerning market manipulation practices."
