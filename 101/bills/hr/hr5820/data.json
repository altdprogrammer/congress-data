    "text": "National Fish and Seafood Promotional Council Reauthorization Act - Amends the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 to replace provisions terminating the National Fish and Seafood Promotional Council, effective October 1, 1990, with provisions directing the Secretary of Commerce to complete a referendum on whether: (1) a majority of the receivers and importers of fish and fish products desire to continue in existence the National Fish and Seafood Promotional Council or a similar entity as an industry supported council; and (2) Congress should be encouraged to extend and modify the provisions of the Act. Requires the Council to study the administration and management of the Council, including methods for determining and collecting assessments from industry members, refusal to pay assessments, and provisions for accepting or rejecting members. Requires that members of the Council and Council staff be retained in their positions until the Act is repealed as provided in this Act. Authorizes appropriations: (1) from the Fisheries Promotional fund to carry out the annual marketing and promotion plan and annual budget of the Council; and (2) to carry out the Act. Repeals this Act effective December 31, 1993."
