Directs the Administrator to: (1) transmit to the Congress a comprehensive aircraft abatement noise plan for airports in the State of Washington; (2) make periodic progress reports to the Congress regarding implementation; and (3) submit biennial reports to certain congressional committees regarding noise level reductions. Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Defense regarding increased use by air carriers of special-use air space over the Pacific Ocean which is being used by military aircraft. Requires the Administrator to issue an environmental impact statement and hold hearings in certain cases of air route changes to altitudes of 15,000 feet or below in order to mitigate aircraft delays and congestion. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish advisory committees in the Department of Transportation to develop a national policy on reducing noise resulting from airport operations. Requires the Secretary to transmit such committees' recommendations to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress recommendations for the reduction of the commercial fleet of Stage II aircraft."
