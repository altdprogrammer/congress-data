    "text": "Department of Energy Science Education Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to establish a Science, Mathematics and Engineering Education Advisory Board (the Board) to provide guidance and assistance for the establishment of the science, mathematics, and engineering education programs of the Department of Energy (the Department) research and development facilities. Requires the Board to report annually to the Secretary and the Congress. Directs the Secretary to develop, with Board advice, a plan for the science, mathematics, and engineering program of the Department's research and development facilities. Requires the Secretary to review such plan annually and report to the Congress on it with the Department's annual budget request. Directs the Secretary to combine the Nuclear Engineering Research and Education Program and the University Research Reactor Program into one program to be called the Nuclear Engineering Education and Research Reactor Program. Directs the Secretary to establish a national clearinghouse to enable the Department's research and development facilities to share, with each other and the education community nationwide, reports, teaching aids, and support materials for science, mathematics, or engineering education. Requires coordination with any other related Federal clearinghouses or related clearinghouses at such facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of paid administrative leave for employees of the Department or its research and development facilities who volunteer to interact with schools, colleges, universities, teachers, or students for science, mathematics, and engineering education. Directs the Secretary to develop alternatives to full Federal funding of science, mathematics, and engineering education programs of the Department's research and development facilities, including use of resources of colleges, universities, local and national businesses, and local and State education agencies. Directs the Secretary to establish a volunteer talent pool of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers who have retired from the Department or its research and development facilities to serve as \"Scientists in Residence\" at schools. Directs the Secretary, through such facilities, to identify and match such scientists with such schools and districts. Directs the Secretary to establish a Young Americans' Summer Science Camp Program to provide secondary school students with hands-on science experience, exposure to working scientists, and career counseling. Requires such Camps to: (1) be conducted at participating colleges and universities; (2) consist of at least two sessions of two weeks each in the first year of operation, with at least 50 participants in each session at each location; and (3) obtain all financing, after the first four years of operation, through private or other non-Federal sources. Directs the Secretary, by the end of the second year of operation, to expand the program to provide guidance and assistance to other organizations to create similar camps. Makes this Act inapplicable to: (1) activities of the Department or its contractors that are funded as national defense production activities; and (2) science, mathematics, and engineering programs administered under elements of the Department other than the Office of Energy Research."
