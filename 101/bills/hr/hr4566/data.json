Requires the establishment in each State of a Medicare arbitration system which meets specified structural and procedural requirements, including the requirement that each claim be decided by a three-person panel selected by both parties to the dispute. Allows such parties to appeal to the appropriate State court to vacate such panel's decision. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint an advisory committee to assist in developing procedures for arbitration panels and in regulating Medical Services Dispute Resolution Organizations responsible for administering the arbitration system in a State. Provides Medicare beneficiaries and applicants with a clear explanation of the binding arbitration system."
