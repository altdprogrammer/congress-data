Requires the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support projects in Poland and Hungary to enhance the nongovernmental sector and reduce state involvement in the economy. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 to implement the 1987 U.S.-Polish science and technology agreement. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 to carry out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to be available only for: (1) the provision of medical supplies and hospital equipment to Poland and for training of Polish medical personnel; and (2) unconditional support of democratic institutions in Poland and Hungary. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) encourage privately administered educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and Poland and the United States and Hungary through the International Research and Exchanges Board, the National Academy of Sciences, the Fulbright Educational Exchange Program, and the United States Information Agency; (2) consider establishing reciprocal cultural centers in the United States and such countries to facilitate government and privately funded educational exchanges; and (3) consult with western allies and Japan on establishing a comprehensive economic recovery program in Hungary and Poland in the context of binding commitments by such countries to establish democracies and free economies."
