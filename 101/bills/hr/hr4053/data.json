    "text": "Coalfield Environment Enhancement Act of 1990 - Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to authorize any State with an approved abandoned mine reclamation program to establish a State-administered Remining Insurance Program which shall include a State Remining Insurance Fund. Outlines the prerequisites of a federally-approved State Remining Insurance Program. Declares that such a Fund shall assume the liability of member surface mining operators to mitigate adverse environmental effects resulting from specified unanticipated conditions (except pre-existing acid or toxic discharges). Requires insurance applicants to identify those conditions within or adjacent to the proposed permit whose risk potential justifies insurance coverage. Sets forth the maximum percentage which a State may dedicate to the Insurance Fund from its annual Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund grant. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate final regulations establishing environmental protection performance and reclamation standards and a separate permit system applicable to: (1) on-site reprocessing of abandoned coal refuse piles; and (2) abandoned coal refuse pile removal. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to certain congressional committees detailing the environmental protection performance and reclamation standards and separate permit systems. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to increase the annual Federal assistance grant for State surface mining control programs if a State: (1) has insufficient fiscal resources for program enforcement; or (2) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Secretary for implementation of the Applicant Violator System settlement agreement. Authorizes the State of West Virginia to use specified amounts from its Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund grant to conduct a fish hatchery feasibility study."
