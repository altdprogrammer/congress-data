    "text": "Youth Opportunities Unlimited Act of 1990 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to establish a Youth Opportunities Unlimited Program. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish such national program of Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) grants to pay 50 percent of the cost of comprehensive services for youth in high poverty areas in cities and rural areas. Requires such grants to be awarded to the local service delivery area (on behalf of the participating community) in which the target area is located (or to designated grantees if the target area is in a farmworker community, Indian reservation, or Alaskan native village). Authorizes the Secretary to select as grant recipients up to 25 communities in first year after the program is in effect. Requires that at least one, but not more than three, of such grants be awarded to designated representatives of Indian reservations and Alaskan native villages. Makes such grants cover a three-year period, with each year conditional upon compliance. Authorizes participating communities to apply for use grants on behalf of target areas. Requires that a designated target area have not more than 25,000 population, except in the case of single school districts. Makes all youth aged 14 to 22 in the target area eligible to participate in assisted programs and activities. Requires each participating community to develop an integrated service delivery system in each target area which meets specified minimum criteria for services. Requires such programs to also have an education component, outreach and recruitment efforts, and measurable goals and outcomes. Sets forth requirements for maintenance of State and local funding levels, limitations on use of program funds, applications, and Federal and local shares. Directs the Secretary to provide for technical assistance, independent evaluations, and a report to the President and the Congress by March 31, 1995. Authorizes appropriations."
