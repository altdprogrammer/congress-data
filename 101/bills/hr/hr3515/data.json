    "text": "Airspace Protection Act of 1989 - Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide written notice on any proposed designation of special use airspace to: (1) the Governor of any State over which airspace is sought to be designated as special use airspace; (2) the head of an Indian tribe on any Indian lands which are likely to be affected by such designation; and (3) the Secretary of the Interior, if such designation includes airspace above any national park, national wildlife refuge, national wild and scenic river, national trail, or national wilderness administered by the Department of the Interior. Directs the Secretary of Defense, upon the request of any Governor, to hold a public meeting and consider comments prior to making a determination with respect to such designation. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to adopt procedures for assuring that such designations comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and for the triennial review of each designation. Provides for the termination or modification of any designation if determined that the use of such airspace cannot justify the continued designation of special use airspace."
