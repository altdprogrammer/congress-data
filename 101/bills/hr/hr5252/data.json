Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should take the following steps with respect to China: (1) oppose all loans by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development which do not meet basic human needs; (2) increase funds to the Voice of America for transmissions into China, including Tibet; (3) support Taiwan's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and (4) impose further sanctions."
