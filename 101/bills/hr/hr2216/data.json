Requires States to make ambulatory prenatal care available to pregnant women during a 60-day presumptive eligibility period unless they fail to apply for Medicaid coverage within 14 days after the commencement of such period. Deems a food stamp card issued in a pregnant woman's name to be sufficient evidence of presumptive eligibility. Directs States to provide outreach and public education services in geographic areas with high rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes to inform low-income women of the need for and availability of prenatal care. Requires States to provide Medicaid coverage for the immunization of children under age six who are eligible for Medicaid or are receiving food stamps. Reduces Federal Medicaid administrative cost matching rates in excess of 50 percent."
