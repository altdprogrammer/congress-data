Authorizes such an individual to register to vote in a Federal election at the appropriate polling place on the date of the election. Requires States to provide for maximum accessibility to registration offices and forms. Directs the Federal Election Commission to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act, taking into consideration the need for uniformity in voter registration procedures. Declares that this Act does not prevent any State from providing greater access to voter registration."
