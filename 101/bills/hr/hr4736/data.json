Part B: Modifications to Existing Report Requirements - Modifies existing defense reporting requirements by reducing the frequency of certain reports from a bimonthly to a semiannual basis, from a semiannual to an annual basis, or from an annual to a biennial basis. Increases the threshold amounts for certain spending or costs triggering reporting requirements. Title II: Report Provisions Previously Terminated Under Goldwater-Nichols Act - Repeals specified reporting requirements under armed forces provisions which were terminated by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 and restores others. Repeals the provisions of such Act that generally terminated all report, notification, or study requirements under Federal armed forces provisions. Title III: Technical and Clerical Amendments - Makes conforming and clerical amendments. Extends from July 1, 1990, to January 1, 1993, the deadline for full integration of fixed wing aircraft at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, into the range instrumentation system for attack helicopters. Removes as a condition for the transfer of obsolete naval vessels the failure of the Congress to pass a concurrent resolution opposing the transfer."
