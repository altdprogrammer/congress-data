Prescribes the use of such information by the Commandant. Precludes access to information that was entered more than three years before the date of request unless it relates to revocations or suspensions which are still in effect on the date of request. Directs the Commandant to prescribe regulations to require each applicant to make available to the Commandant information regarding the motor vehicle driving record of the applicant."
