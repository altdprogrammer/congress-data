    "text": "Amends the Reclamation States Drought Assistance Act of 1988 to extend: (1) through March 1, 1992, the period for completion of studies to augment, make use of, or conserve water supplies available to Federal reclamation projects and Indian water resources development; and (2) through 1991 authorized construction, management, and conservation activities to mitigate damages resulting from drought conditions. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to purchase water from willing sellers and to make such water available to reclamation project and nonproject water users at rates sufficient to repay the Secretary for the cost of such water. Extends through 1991 the general and contract authority of the Secretary to make available water or canal capacity at existing Federal reclamation projects to water users and others on a temporary basis to mitigate damages due to drought conditions. Requires that the cost of water made available by the Secretary to protect fish and wildlife resources, even during drought conditions, shall be nonreimbursable. Authorizes the Secretary to store and convey nonproject water utilizing Federal reclamation project facilities for purposes other than irrigation and for use outside the authorized project service area at a rate sufficient to repay the cost of storing and conveying such water. Extends through 1991 the authority of the Secretary to make emergency loans for mitigating drought damages. Authorizes the Secretary to defer without penalty the payment of any charge as the Secretary deems necessary because of financial hardship caused by drought. Provides that actions taken under such Act in response to emergency conditions shall not be subject to provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act. Extends through 1991 the emergency drought program. Increases the total amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out the Reclamation States Drought Assistance Act of 1988."
