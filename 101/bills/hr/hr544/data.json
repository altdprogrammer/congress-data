Requires that with respect to lease revenues derived from lands acquired by the United States under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act: (1) 50 percent be deposited into the Fund; and (2) 25 percent of such revenues be paid to the county where the leased lands or deposits are or were located. Requires that with respect to lease revenues acquired from lands under another specified Act 25 percent be deposited into the Fund, and 75 percent be paid to the State. Provides that payments to States under this Act be made by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to make annual payments from the Fund to States for game and nongame fish and wildlife programs. Allocates monies to the States according to the relative percentage of State lands constituting leased Federal lands and the relative percentage of State's population constituting hunting and fishing license holders. Requires States to report annually to the Secretary on projects undertaken using such payments. Requires that 50 percent of mineral receipts collected from leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska be deposited into such Fund. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands to transfer to the Secretary the authority to administer certain mineral leases and to collect all receipts due and payable to the United States under them."
