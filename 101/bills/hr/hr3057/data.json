Requires each person who requests or receives a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from an agency or requests or receives from an agency a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan to file with such agency specified written declarations concerning prohibited payments. Requires the head of each agency to compile such declarations and to submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House a semiannual report containing a compilation of the declarations received. Directs that such report, including the compilation, be available for public inspection. Provides for the imposition of a civil penalty upon any person: (1) who makes an expenditure prohibited by this Act; or (2) who fails to file or amend a declaration required to be filed or amended under this Act. Authorizes the head of an agency to terminate a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, loan, loan insurance, or loan guaranty on the basis of any violation of the requirements of this Act. Requires the Inspector General or comparable official of each agency to submit to the Congress each year an evaluation of the compliance of that agency with, and the effectiveness of, the requirements imposed by this Act. Sets forth exceptions to: (1) the prohibitions of this Act with respect to certain legislative liaison and technical services activities; and (2) reporting requirements with respect to Federal contracts, loans, loan guarantees, or loan insurance not exceeding specified amounts."
