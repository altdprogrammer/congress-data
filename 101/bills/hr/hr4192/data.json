    "text": "Eastern European Economic Cooperation and Political Freedom Act of 1990 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to provide specific guidelines for the export of nonmilitary items to Warsaw Pact countries, in light of glasnost and perestroika. Requires publication of decisions on requests for general exceptions to the International Control List of the Coordinating Committee in order to assure equal access for U.S. exporters to controlled-country markets. Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. nationals conducting commercial ventures in a controlled-country should undertake to ensure that: (1) they do not use any article believed to be manufactured by convict or forced labor; (2) the political and religious views, sex, national origin, or involvement of individuals in human rights activities will not prohibit the hiring or affect the terms of employment of such individuals in such commercial ventures; (3) they decline to use, under specified conditions, a building that was previously used for religious activities; (4) methods of production used to meet international standards for occupational safety and that they do not pose environmental risks; and (5) private cooperatives are sought out as potential participants in such commercial ventures."
