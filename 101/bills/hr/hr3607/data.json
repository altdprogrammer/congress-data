Excepts reductions of the deductible for blood from such repeal. Repeals provisions of the Act imposing an annual supplemental Medicare premium on part A beneficiaries whose tax liability equals or exceeds $150 and establishes the Federal Hospital Insurance Catastrophic Coverage Reserve Fund. Delays, from November 30, 1988, to May 31, 1990, the date by which the Secretary of the Treasury must report to the Congress on Federal tax policies to promote private financing of long-term care. Title II: Provisions Relating to Part B of the Medicare Program - Repals the Act's amendments to part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program, including the financing mechanisms created to support the Act's expansion of part B benefits. Excepts from such repeal the requirement that physician payment requests include diagnostic coding information. Requires the revision of Medicare supplemental health insurance policy standards to relect this Act's enactment. Directs such policies to inform policyholders who are Medicare beneficiaries of the changes made by this Act's enactment and their effect on the policy. Requires Medicare supplemental insurance policies from which an individual terminated his or her coverage prior to this Act's enactment to offer such individual policy terms which: (1) impose no waiting period for the treatment of preexisting conditions; (2) offer coverage substantially equivalent to the old coverage; and (3) classify premiums at least as favorably for the individual as did the old policy. Requires the continued provision of certain part B benefits otherwise repealed by this Act to health maintenance organization enrollees through 1990. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to notify Medicare beneficiaries of changes made by this Act's enactment. Title III: Miscellaneous Amendments - Repeals the Act's extension of: (1) certain waiver of liability provisions applicable to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies; and (2) the prohibition of new Medicare cost-saving regulations.
