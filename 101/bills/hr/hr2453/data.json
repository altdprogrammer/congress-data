    "text": "Amends Federal law relating to merchant seamen licenses, including licenses as masters, mates, engineers, pilots, operators, and radio officers, to prohibit the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating from issuing or renewing a license, and to require the Secretary to suspend or revoke a license issued, to an individual who the Secretary determines is a current or chronic abuser of alcohol or who fails to make available to the Secretary all information contained in the National Driver Register regarding that individual's motor vehicle driving record. Directs the Secretary to conduct investigations to determine if an individual who holds a license issued by the Secretary is a current or chronic abuser of alcohol if the Secretary receives information regarding any alcohol-related misconduct of the individual or that the individual has been found guilty of an alcohol-related infraction resulting in suspension or revocation of a motor vehicle operator license. Authorizes the Secretary to request an individual who holds a license issued by the Secretary to make available to the Secretary all information contained in the National Driver Register regarding the motor vehicle driving record of that individual. Prohibits the Secretary from terminating a license suspension until the individual provides sufficient proof that the individual is no longer a current or chronic abuser of alcohol. Amends the National Driver Register Act of 1982 to authorize applicants for and holders of such licenses to request the chief State driver licensing official to transmit to the Secretary information regarding such applicants' or holders' motor vehicle driving records. Prescribes the use of such information by the Secretary. Precludes access to information that was entered more than five years before the date of request unless it relates to revocations or suspensions which are still in effect on the date of request."
