    "date": "1990-10-27", 
    "text": "Radon Awareness and Disclosure Act - Title I: Three-Year Extension of Indoor Radon Abatement Provisions of Toxic Substances Control Act - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to extend through FY 1994 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publication entitled \"A Citizen's Guide to Radon\"; (2) model construction standards and techniques for controlling radon levels in new buildings; (3) grants to States for radon programs; and (4) regional radon training centers. Title II: Radon Testing Provisions - Directs Federal agencies and Government-controlled corporations that provide federally related mortgages for house purchases to require, before such mortgages are received, that such houses be tested for radon and that the results of such tests be made available to potential purchasers. Requires houses owned by Federal agencies or Government-controlled corporations to be tested for radon before sold and provides that test results shall be made available to potential purchasers. Directs the EPA Administrator to establish a program that requires: (1) products offered for sale, or devices used in connection with public services, for radon measurement to meet minimum performance criteria; and (2) operators of devices, or persons employing techniques, used in connection with public services for radon measurement to meet a minimum level of proficiency. Requires the Administrator to establish user fees for manufacturers of such products or devices and for persons who operate such devices or employ such techniques. Waives or reduces such fees for persons who agree to test for radon in public and nonprofit child care facilities, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, or other care facilities. Provides for the deposit of such fees into a Radon Service Account. Directs the Administrator, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to: (1) jointly evaluate efforts to promote radon testing and ways to increase radon testing during real estate transactions; and (2) report to the Congress on alternative strategies for promoting such testing. Requires the Administrator to give grant preferences under the Toxic Substances Control Act to States which make efforts to adopt requirements for radon testing in residential real estate transactions. Title III: Radon in Schools - Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring local educational agencies to: (1) test each school building under the authority of such agencies; and (2) test, by September 30, 1993, school buildings in areas having a higher than average risk of radon exposure. Makes the results of such tests available to the public. Requires radon testing to be carried out by individuals approved by the Administrator pursuant to proficiency programs under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Establishes within EPA a Radon Testing and Mitigation Assistance Program to provide assistance for testing and mitigation devices and methods. Requires State Governors to establish priority lists of assistance applicants, based on the nature and magnitude of potential exposure to radon. Sets forth criteria to be considered by the Administrator in ranking such applications. Authorizes the provision of grants of up to 50 percent of the cost of a testing program and loans for up to 100 percent of the cost of a mitigation program. Prescribes civil penalties for failures to comply with testing in school buildings. Sets forth provisions concerning citizen complaints. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: President's Commission on Radon Awareness - Establishes the President's Commission on Radon Awareness to: (1) examine public radon awareness programs; (2) act as an administrative and coordinating body for the donation of resources to implement programs and strategies to raise awareness of the health threats of radon; (3) encourage media outlets to provide information to increase radon awareness; and (4) assist in the update of such programs and strategies. Title V: Radon in the Workplace - Directs the Administrator to set a standard for the level of exposure to radon in the workplace that is associated with no greater health risk than the risk indicated by the EPA's action level for radon developed under the Toxic Substances Control Act."
