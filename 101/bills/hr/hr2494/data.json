    "text": "International Development and Finance Act of 1989 - Title I: Export-Import Bank Act Amendments - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to remove a certain limitation on the Bank's authority to make interest subsidy payments. Limits the amounts authorized to be appropriated for such payments for FY 1990 and 1991. Extends the Bank's authority to make interest subsidy payments to October 1, 1991. Extends the Bank's authority to make interest subsidy payments to October 1, 1991. Makes technical amendments to provisions concerning the administration of the tied aid credit program. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1991 for the Tied Aid Credit Fund. Prohibits the Bank from providing any export financing, loans, or financial services to China. Waives such prohibitions with respect to food or agricultural commodities. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibitions if he reports to the Congress that: (1) the Chinese Government has made progress on a program of political reform in China and Tibet; or (2) it is in the U.S. national interest to terminate such suspension. Authorizes the Bank to accept reimbursement for travel and subsistence expenses incurred by Bank employees. Prohibits the Bank from guaranteeing, insuring, or extending credit in connection with the exports of goods (other than food or agricultural commodities) or services to Angola until the President certifies to the Congress that free and fair elections have been held in Angola and that the Angolan Government: (1) is seeking to achieve an equitable political settlement of conflict through a mutual cease-fire and a dialogue with opposition armed forces; and (2) has demonstrated progress in protecting human and worker rights and other attributes of political pluralism and democracy. Title II: Inter-American Development Bank - Amends the Inter-American Development Bank Act to authorize the U.S. Governor of the Bank to vote for resolutions which: (1) were transmitted by the Board of Executive Directors to the Governors by resolution of April 19, 1989; (2) are pending before the Board of Governors of the Bank; and (3) provide for increases in the authorized capital stock of the Bank and resources of the Fund for Special Operations. Permits the Governor, upon adoption of such resolutions, to subscribe to a certain number of shares of the increase in capital stock and contribute a certain amount to the Fund. Authorizes appropriations to pay for such increases.
