Title II: Status of Plans - Provides that, if a final forest plan is enjoined by a court, the immediately previous final version of such plan shall remain in effect. Title III: Implementation of Plans - Sets limitations on administrative appeals in addition to the Department of Agriculture's appeals regulations. Grants jurisdiction to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such national forest is located to review: (1) land and resource management plans; (2) documents establishing minimum management requirements in forests; and (3) action implementing a land resource management plan. Provides for tiering of environmental documentation and the achievement of the allowable sale quantity (ASQ) of timber on a forest-by-forest basis. Requires the Administration's budget request for each year beginning with FY 1992, to include a statement of what funds would be required to achieve 100 percent of the output specified for each forest with respect to its land and resource management plan."
