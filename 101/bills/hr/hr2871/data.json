    "text": "Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvement Act of 1989 - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 to carry out all except specified provisions of that Act. Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish and maintain a permanent import surveillance program with the U.S. Customs Service to carry out the Act and other Acts administered by the Commission and to prevent the importation of unsafe consumer products. Authorizes the Commission to provide the Customs Service with all information, violator lists, test results, and any other support necessary for the Service to enforce the Commission's safety standards, bans, and regulations. Requires the Commission, if it intends to terminate a rulemaking proceeding in reliance on a voluntary standard, to publish notice and consider comments before terminating the rulemaking. Requires the Commission, if a person has submitted a statement of intention to modify or develop a voluntary standard in response to an invitation issued by the Commission, to monitor the person's progress and, if the person is not making reasonable progress, to continue the rulemaking proceeding. Requires the Commission to establish and maintain a plan to monitor compliance with a voluntary standard relied on by the Commission. Requires manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of a consumer product distributed in commerce who obtain information reasonably supporting the conclusion that the product fails to comply with consumer product safety rule or a voluntary standard (currently, with a consumer product safety rule) to inform the Commission. Reduces the size of the Commission from five to three Commissioners, stating that the reduction does not apply to members who are in office on the date of enactment of this Act. Reduces the number of Commissioners who may be of the same political party from three to two. Reduces the number constituting a quorum from three to two. States that the quorum provisions apply to regularly called meetings of the Commission. Adds to the list of duties of the Commission that of collecting, from Federal and State agencies and from private entities engaged in the monitoring of consumer products, information respecting defects and other safety hazards in consumer products. Requires the presiding officer at a hearing relating to orders concerning substantial product hazards to transmit to the Commission any settlement offer submitted, unless clearly frivolous or duplicative of previous offers."
