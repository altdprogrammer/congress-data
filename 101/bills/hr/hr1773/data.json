Directs the Secretary to make domestic content information available to the public beginning with the 1991 model year. Makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to fail to meet applicable domestic content requirements. Sets forth administrative and civil measures for such failure and for related violations. Directs the Secretary and the Federal Trade Commission jointly to undertake a study of, and report to the Congress regarding, discriminatory practices which motor vehicle manufacturers use to persuade dealers to favor foreign made automotive parts over domestically-produced parts."
