Requires the Secretary to: (1) appeal a decision which requires the Secretary's acquiescence in more than one circuit on the same question of law; and (2) apply such decision to all individuals and circumstances in all circuits if the question of law is not reviewed by the Supreme Court. Gives the U.S. courts of appeals original jurisdiction over actions in the nature of mandamus brought by individuals whose rights may be prejudiced if the Federal Government is not compelled to carry out its duties under this Act."
