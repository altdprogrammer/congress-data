    "text": "Insular Recovery Act of 1990 - Authorizes appropriations for the construction of facilities to protect public health and safety and to enhance the survivability of essential infrastructure in the event of disasters in insular areas. Authorizes Governors of affected insular areas, for two years after a disaster is declared, to: (1) transfer up to 100 percent of specified allotment under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 for use in disaster recovery or enhancement of infrastructure in the fiscal year in which a disaster occurs; and (2) inform the Secretary of such transfers. Deems Puerto Rico to be an insular area for such purposes and for purposes of receiving grants under a specified Act for the two years following a disaster. Requires the President to provide technical assistance to insular areas which lack specific capabilities in responding to disasters. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress on the status of recovery efforts in insular areas declared to be disasters by the President. Authorizes the President to waive: (1) cost contribution requirements under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act with respect to hazard mitigation expenditures in an insular area if such waiver would promote reconstruction to enhance infrastructure or public health and safety in a disaster area; and (2) a requirement under such Act for the use of local firms in responding to a disaster if the disaster exceeds the capabilities of such firms. Authorizes the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration to provide financial and technical assistance in any insular area declared to be a disaster by the President. Terminates such authority five years after such declaration."
