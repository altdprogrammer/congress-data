    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1989-07-17", 
    "text": "Title I: Authorizes appropriations for the programs, functions, and activities of the Bureau of Land Management for FY 1990 through 1993. Title II: Amendments to Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to add greater specificity to the definition of areas of critical environmental concern (ACECs) by adding references to environmental, ecological, and scientific resources. (Current law provides for the protection of historic, cultural, and scenic resources.) Provides that designation of an ACEC on public lands could be done in order to protect resources either located on or likely to be affected by the use of public lands. Makes explicit that an additional reason for designation of an ACEC could be to protect or enhance the resources and values of a conservation system unit. Specifies that it is not the intent of the Congress that the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) establish protective perimeters or buffer zones around ACECs or conservation system units. Defines the term \"conservation system unit\" to mean any unit of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, or a National Conservation Area or National Forest Monument. Expands the definition of \"principal or major uses\" of the public lands so as to include explicit references to the maintenance of plant communities, the maintenance of fish and wildlife populations and habitat, reforestation, and scientific research. Adds riparian areas as a priority for the Secretary of the Interior's inventory of all public lands and their resource and other values. Provides for congressional disapproval of certain decisions by the Secretary to implement land use plans by the enactment of a joint resolution. (Current law requires adoption of a concurrent resolution.) Requires that land use plans be developed for all public lands outside Alaska no later than January 1, 1997, and for all public lands no later than January 1, 1999. Requires that such plans be revised at least every 15 years. Requires the Secretary, in the development and revision of land use plans, to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of measures, consistent with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, that would enhance the extent to which the public lands can support increases in the numbers and types of plant communities and fish and wildlife populations located on or supported by such lands; (2) give priority to identification, protection, and enhancement of the ecological, environmental, fish and wildlife, and other resources and values of riparian areas; and (3) include recreational and other nonconsumptive uses when considering present and potential uses of the public lands. Changes the title of the Associate Director of the Bureau of Land Management to Deputy Director. Adds the positions of State Directors of the Bureau which the Secretary may appoint as necessary. Prohibits, after May 1, 1989, the appointment of any person as Deputy Director of the Bureau or as an Assistant Director or State Director who is not at the time of appointment either a career appointee or in the competitive service. Authorizes the Secretary to permit State military departments (or their equivalents) to use, occupy, and develop public lands only through rights-of-way, withdrawals, and, where the proposed use and development are similar or closely related to the programs of the Secretary for the public lands involved, cooperative agreements. Allows the Secretary to permit use of public lands by the military department of one or more States for purposes of military training, equipment testing, or other authorized military activities. Sets forth provisions with respect to the granting of such permission where such military activities are not likely to result in a significant degree of residual contamination of affected lands and also where such activities are likely to have such a result. Authorizes the Secretary to waive rental charges for the use of public land by a State military department. Requires each State military department using public lands withdrawn for military purposes to take precautions to prevent and suppress range and brush fires caused by their use of such lands. Requires the Secretary concerned to report to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on the extent to which the Department of Defense and the military departments of the States have been authorized since January 1, 1987, to use public lands or National Forest lands, and the conditions under which such lands may be used by such agencies. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reimburse a State military department for costs resulting from this Act and incident to specified uses of lands by a State National Guard or U.S. armed forces. Increases the fine for violation of any regulation issued by the Secretary to implement the provisions of the Act with respect to the management, use, and protection of public lands from a maximum of $1,000 to a maximum of $10,000. Requires the Secretary, in managing the public lands: (1) to minimize adverse environmental impacts on such lands and their resources resulting from use, occupancy, or development of such lands; and (2) to prevent impairment or derogation of the resources and values of conservation system units. Adds an explicit reference to the protection of environmental quality, the management and enhancement of fish and wildlife populations and habitat, and outdoor recreation as being included in the citizens' concerns to be represented through appointments to the Secretary's advisory councils. Requires the provision of an opportunity for interested members of the public to suggest persons for appointment to such councils. Requires the Secretary, in promulgating rules and regulations with respect to the public lands, to provide for appropriate management of areas of critical environmental concern and provide an opportunity for the public to propose specific areas for consideration for designation as areas of critical environmental concern. Changes the dates on which the Secretary must submit a request for the authorization of appropriations for all programs, functions, and activities of the Bureau to January 1, 1991, and January 1 of each second odd-numbered year thereafter. (Current law requires such requests beginning May 15, 1977, and not later than May 15 of each second even numbered year thereafter.) Prohibits funds that are appropriated for purposes of land acquisition from being expended for any other purpose. Provides that no regulation shall impose liability without fault with respect to a right-of-way granted, issued, or renewed under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to a non-profit entity or an entity qualified for financing under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 if such entity uses such right-of-way for the delivery of electricity to parties having an equity interest in such entity. Requires that a specified tract of land of the Sebastian Martin Land Grant near Los Luceros, New Mexico, be treated as public land for purposes of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Directs the Bureau of Land Management to permit, until July 1, 1990, any person providing public recreational services on public lands covered by the July 14, 1926, right-of-way granted to the Santa Cruz Irrigation District of New Mexico to continue to provide such services on the same terms and conditions as were provided on June 30, 1989. Prohibits subleasing which is defined as grazing on public lands or National Forest lands covered by a grazing permit of domestic livestock which are not both owned and controlled by the holder of the grazing permit. Provides penalties for a violation of such prohibition."
