    "text": "Anti-Drug Education Act of 1990 - Declares it to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to make more efforts, which are urgently needed, in the areas of drug and alcohol abuse education and prevention. Amends the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 (the Act) to require that drug-free school zones have specified characteristics. Authorizes a program for replication of successful drug abuse education programs. Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary), under such program, to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or consortia of LEAs and private nonprofit entities to provide drug abuse education, prevention, or counseling services to students in kindergarten through grade 12. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993 for such program. Authorizes the use of local drug abuse education and prevention funds for after-school programs that provide drug and alcohol abuse education for school-aged children, including children who are unsupervised after school, and that may include school-sponsored sports, recreational, educational, or instructional activities (but only if the LEA determines that it provides sufficient drug and alcohol abuse education during regular school hours). Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to any private nonprofit agency that has an agreement with an LEA to provide training in drug abuse counseling for individuals who will provide such counseling in the LEA's schools. Requires the Secretary to give priority in making a substantial number of grants to LEAs, State education agencies, and higher education institutions for such training. Requires that such funds be used for grants to train counselors, social workers, psychologists, or nurses who are providing or will be providing drug abuse prevention, counseling, or referral services in schools. Increases the amount authorized to be appropriated for training grants and for emergency grants under the Act for FY 1991 through 1993. Requires LEAs applying for grants to demonstrate, to the extent practicable, how grant assistance will be: (1) used to provide drug abuse counseling services to children of all ages, including elementary school students; and (2) coordinated with local law enforcement agencies in school security and drug abuse education activities. Requires that local recipients of funds clearly identify any assisted program as a Federal program funded under the Act."
