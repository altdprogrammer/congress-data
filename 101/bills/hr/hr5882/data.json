Requires employers to provide such leave to full-time employees who have been in their employ for at least 12 months before such a leave request. Subjects to civil penalties employers who refuse to provide such leave or who discriminate against an employee who requests such leave. Provides that such leave requirements shall take effect with respect to the school year beginning in 1991. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to grant a family leave credit to employers who provide their employees with family leave for attending school activities. Sets such credit at an amount equal to ten percent of the employer's qualified family leave expenses for the taxable year. Requires employers to post notice of such leave requirements. Sets civil penalties for violations of the notice requirement."
