Directs the Administrator to develop at least ten tree-planting and harvesting programs on federally-owned or State-owned lands. Grants priority to certain projects. Directs the SBA to help grantees with rapid implementation of such programs in periods of high unemployment. Requires grantees to use small business concerns and contractors whenever feasible. Establishes formulae for payment to the Treasury of proceeds from the sale of trees and forestry products under this program. Authorizes Federal agencies to furnish certain kinds of free technical services to grantees. Requires an annual report to the Congress and the President. Authorizes appropriations."
