    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-23", 
    "text": "Paperwork Reduction and Federal Information Resources Management Act of 1990 - Title I: Information Collection and Dissemination by Federal Agencies - Grants the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the authority to disapprove information collection requests proposed by Federal agencies. Revises provisions concerning paperwork control functions of the Director that relate to the reduction of the burdens of such requests to no longer require the setting of reduction goals but to instead require the establishment of procedures for agencies to estimate the burden and benefit that will result from such a proposed request. Establishes new functions for OMB with respect to paperwork control and automatic data processing which are, respectively: (1) promoting the reduction of unnecessary burdens imposed by Federal information collection requests on small business, Federal contractors, educational institutions, and State and local governments with particular emphasis on Federal taxation, procurement, and grant programs and conducting pilot projects to test the feasibility and value of changes in Federal information collection policies and procedures; and (2) developing and implementing policy guidance that describes the system by which Federal agencies must initiate, approve, and process plans for major acquisitions of automatic data processing equipment. Requires the information dissemination functions of the Director to include issuing guidance, after notice and receipt of public comment, that shall: (1) be applied by Federal agencies disseminating public information products and services; (2) apply to all significant products and services, regardless of the form in which the information is disseminated; (3) supplement and not replace laws requiring public information disclosure and certain laws concerning public printing and documents; and (4) be consistent with and promote disseminating such products and services equitably in a manner that promotes their usefulness to the public while encouraging a diversity of providers. Requires agencies which disseminate significant public information products or services to disseminate in usable electronic format information maintained in such format by utilizing the Government Printing Office to the extent provided by law. Requires agencies, in determining how to fulfill their public information dissemination functions, to consider certain criteria. Allows agencies to reduce or waive user fees for dissemination when dissemination may enhance an agency's mission. Prohibits agencies from taking certain actions restricting dissemination. Requires the Director, in carrying out information collection request review functions and reviews of such requests, to: (1) oversee the maintenance and improvement of the Federal Information Locator System; (2) identify and eliminate areas of duplication and unnecessary burden in information collection requests; (3) establish requirements for agency reviews of such requests and estimates of their burdens and benefits; (4) carry out functions relating to paperwork control; (5) maintain a public record for each information collection request review; (6) notify appropriate agency heads of all meetings of employees of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and non-Federal employees and provide them with an opportunity to attend such meetings; and (7) consider public comments and other relevant material. Requires the Director, in carrying out provisions with respect to the coordination of Federal information policy, to: (1) recommend to the President, for submission to the Congress, legislative proposals to remove legal inconsistencies and practices involving privacy, confidentiality, and disclosure of information; (2) create comprehensive information resources management policies; (3) issue, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Archivist of the United States, principles, standards, and guidelines to implement such policies; and (4) develop and annually revise, in consultation with the Administrator and Archivist, a five-year plan for information resources management. Requires officials carrying out the responsibilities of their agencies under such provisions to be career appointees in the Senior Executive Service well qualified through experience or training to carry out the programs. Requires Federal agencies to report to the Director on the privacy, information disclosure, confidentiality, and security implications of each significant information system planned by the agency. Requires Federal agencies, in proposing or reviewing an information collection request, to ensure that such requests are necessary for performance of agency functions, to explain the need and use of such information, and to use understandable language and appropriate statistical survey methodology to effectively and efficiently collect such information. Requires Federal agencies to review each information collection request contained in a rule at least once every three years. Requires the Director, annually, to: (1) conduct random audits of agency reviews for which no changes are proposed to determine whether the agency has properly applied standards; and (2) report to the Congress on audit findings. Directs agency heads to report annually to the Congress on coordination of Federal information policy and to maintain public records for each request under review by OIRA. Revises provisions concerning public information collection activities. Requires the Director to approve a proposed change to an existing information request within 30 days after receipt. Allows requests to remain in effect if the revision reduces the burden resulting from such request without substantially changing the request. Limits the authority of the Director to determine the necessity of a collection of information under an existing information collection request contained in a rule to the authority provided under provisions regarding Federal agency responsibilities and public information collection activities. Amends provisions regarding responsiveness to the Congress to revise the contents of the Director's report to the Congress on the major activities involving the coordination of Federal information policy. Directs the Comptroller General to review and annually submit to the Congress a report regarding the: (1) performance by the Director regarding the promoting of the reduction of the unnecessary burden imposed by the Federal information collection requests; (2) functions assigned to the Comptroller General under provisions concerning the coordination of the Federal information policy; and (3) performance by the agencies of their information collection request review functions under such provisions. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the House Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Committee on Government Affairs on the effectiveness of OIRA and agencies in fulfilling their information coordination functions within six months before the expiration of appropriated funds. Requires the Director to submit a report to such congressional committees on maintaining and improving the Federal Information Locator System. Authorizes appropriations to OIRA for FY 1990 through 1992. Title II: Federal Government Information Technology - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to: (1) establish and maintain an inventory of all automatic data processing equipment acquired by Federal agencies, except equipment procured by the Central Intelligence Agency or the Department of Defense for intelligence or cryptologic activities related to national security; (2) issue regulations establishing requirements for reporting by Federal agencies of acquisitions of the equipment required to be included in such an inventory; (3) review and audit information in such agency reports; and (4) use such information as appropriate to determine the compliance of Federal agencies with that Act. Prohibits Federal agency heads from procuring any service subject to the requirements of that Act if such service is available under the FTS 2000 contract unless: (1) the agency's requirement for service is outside the scope of such a contract or any modification or option; and (2) GSA approved in advance the procurement strategy the agency intended to use for the acquisition of automatic data processing equipment. Establishes within OMB the Advisory Committee on Statistical Policy to: (1) identify national long-term statistical data needs that can and should be filled by the Federal Government and recommend responses to such needs to the OMB Director and to the Congress; (2) make recommendations to the Director and the Congress for establishing priorities for Federal statistical policy initiatives and for implementing the Director's statistical functions; and (3) make any other recommendations regarding Federal statistical operations that would contribute to the general economic or social welfare or to the competitive position of the United States in the world economy. Requires the Director to: (1) conduct a review of routine uses, with respect to uniformity and consistency with law and published guidelines, for all systems of agency records established in accordance with provisions concerning records maintained on individuals; and (2) report to the Congress on the findings of that review. Revises provisions regarding reports on new systems and matching programs to require agencies proposing a significant change in a routine use to provide adequate advance notice of any such proposal. Requires agency records management programs to comply with provisions governing records disposal. Requires the Archivist of the United States to promulgate regulations establishing standards for: (1) interpreting the definition for the term \"records\"; and (2) creation of documentation of the organization, policies, and procedures of the agency."
