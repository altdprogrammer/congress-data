Requires the Secretary to undertake certain studies to obtain information about conditions which may be influenced by leasing and development activities off the shore of North Carolina to enable the Secretary to carry out responsibilities with respect to authorizing such activities. Establishes the Environmental Sciences Review Panel to make recommendations and findings as to the adequacy of such information. Authorizes appropriations."
