    "text": "Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish within EPA an office to promote pollution prevention through source reduction. Requires the Administrator to develop and implement a source reduction strategy which: (1) establishes standard methods for measuring source reduction; (2) coordinates and promotes source reduction activities and techniques in Federal agencies and businesses; (3) improves coordination of, streamlines, and assures public access to data collected under Federal environmental statutes; (4) establishes a training program on multimedia source reduction opportunities; (5) makes recommendations to the Congress to eliminate barriers to source reduction including the use of incentives; (6) develops and disseminates model source reduction auditing procedures designed to highlight source reduction opportunities; and (7) establishes an annual award program to recognize companies operating outstanding or innovative source reduction programs. Directs the Administrator to make matching grants to States for programs to promote source reduction by businesses. Sets forth criteria to be evaluated in the awarding of such grants. Limits Federal funds for such programs to 50 percent of the funds made available to a State each year. Requires the Administrator to establish a Source Reduction Clearinghouse to compile information including a computer data base which contains information on management, technical, and operational approaches to source reduction. Directs the Administrator to make such information available to the public. Directs owners or operators of facilities required to file annual toxic chemical release forms under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) to include with each such filing a toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report. Sets forth items to be included in such reports, including: (1) the quantity of each chemical entering any waste stream prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal during the reporting year, and the two years thereafter, and the percentage change from the previous year; (2) the amount of the chemical from the facility which is recycled annually, the percentage change from the previous year, and the process of recycling used; (3) the source reduction practices used with respect to such chemicals; (4) a ratio of production in the reporting year to production in the previous year; (5) the amount of any chemical released into the environment which resulted from a one-time event and is not associated with production processes; and (6) the amount of the chemical treated during the year and the percentage change from the previous year. Makes provisions of SARA applicable to the reporting requirements of this Act. Directs the Administrator to make data collected under this Act publicly available in the same manner as data collected under SARA. Requires the Administrator to report biennially to the Congress on actions and results of the source reduction strategy. Authorizes and allocates appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993."
