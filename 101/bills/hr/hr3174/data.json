    "text": "Mid-Dakota Rural Water System Act of 1989 - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior for planning and construction of a rural water treatment and distribution system in portions of specified counties in South Dakota. Prohibits the Secretary from obligating any Federal funds for the construction of such system until the Secretary finds that appropriate non-Federal interests have implemented water conservation programs throughout the system's service area. Provides that mitigation for fish and wildlife losses incurred as a result of the construction and operation of the system shall be on an acre-for-acre basis, based on ecological equivalency, concurrent with project construction. Directs the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration to make available, from power designated for future irrigation and drainage pumping for the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program and subject to certain conditions, the capacity and energy required to meet the pumping requirements of such system."
