Directs the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) designate, and publish a list of, those waters which constitute any part of the geographic range of sea turtles which are listed under such act as an endangered or threatened species; (2) publish and periodically update a list of each country which requires use of turtle excluder devices by its shrimp fishing vessels in designated waters; and (3) carry out provisions of this Act within three years after enactment. Delays the effective date of certain regulations issued by the Secretary on June 29, 1987, relating to sea turtle conservation until three years after enactment of this Act."
