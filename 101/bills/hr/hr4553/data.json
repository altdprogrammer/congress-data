Requires the Commodity Credit Corporation to make a specified amount available in credit guarantees under the Program to finance the export sales of U.S agricultural commodities (excluding wood and processed wood products). Requires the Corporation to insure that: (1) no more than 20 percent of such credit guarantees shall be extended to any one country; and (2) up to $2,000,000 of such guarantees shall be extended to preferred risk countries and those countries that constitute new customers for U.S. agricultural products. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from charging an organization fee in excess of one percent of the credit extended under the Program. Requires the Secretary to establish a personnel system that provides an experienced group of employees to administer the Program."
