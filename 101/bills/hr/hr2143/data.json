    "text": "Integrity in Post Employment Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding former officers or employees of the executive branch, any independent agency, or the District of Columbia attempting to influence the Government or the District. Makes it unlawful, within one year after employment or service has ceased, for: (1) former senior officials to lobby their former employing agency; (2) former top level officials (Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries) to lobby the executive or independent agency in which the person served during the one-year period before the termination of such service; and (3) former top level officials of the legislative or judicial branch to lobby the entity of the branch in which the person served during the one-year period before the termination of such service. Prohibits any senior or top level official (including the President), within 18 months after employment has ceased, from: (1) representing the interests of a foreign entity before any department, agency, or commission of the United States or either House of the Congress, with intent to influence; or (2) aiding or advising a foreign entity with intent to influence a decision of such an agency or the Congress. Prohibits any person from acting as an agent and communicating on behalf of such former officials and Members of Congress. Includes as exceptions to such prohibitions: (1) any person who is engaging solely in the solicitation or collection of funds and contributions within the United States to be used only for medical assistance, food, or clothing to relieve human suffering; or (2) any person who is providing a statement based on that person's special knowledge, provided that no compensation is received for such statement other than that regularly provided by law for witnesses. Increases the criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Prohibits the partner of a Member, officer, or employee of the legislative branch in a partnership for the provision of professional services from acting as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise representing, any other person other than the United States in lobbying activities before any department, agency, court or commission of the United States, or the House of the Congress in which the individual serves or is employed in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest, and in which such individual participates or has participated personally and substantially. Provides for the imposition of penalties upon any Member of Congress who: (1) affiliates with a firm, partnership, association, or corporation for the purpose of providing professional services for compensation; (2) permits the use of the Member's name by such firm, partnership, association, or corporation; or (3) practices a profession for compensation. Imposes criminal penalties upon Members of Congress who accept honoraria. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit Members of Congress from converting excess campaign funds to their own use. Applies independent counsel provisions to Members of Congress."
