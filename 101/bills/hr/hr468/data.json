Implements in its place a level percentage of base salary for beneficiaries of active-duty members (notwithstanding their age), and a level percentage of base salary for beneficiaries of reserve members. Repeals current Federal provisions which: (1) reduce the annuity amount for beneficiaries upon attaining age 62; and (2) base eligibility for such annuity payments on participation in the SBP on or before a specified date."
