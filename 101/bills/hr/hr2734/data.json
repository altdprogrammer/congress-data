    "text": "National Ground Water Research Act of 1990 - Directs the President to coordinate Federal ground water research, monitoring, and protection activities through the establishment of an Interagency Ground Water Research Committee. Requires the Committee to appoint an Education Committee to review the academic and related institutional capabilities for education and training of ground water research related professionals and to identify opportunities for improving such education and training. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the U.S. Geological Survey, to prepare a report assessing ground water quality and quantity information systems and data collection and monitoring. Requires the Secretary to submit such report to the Congress with biennial updates. Directs the Secretary to conduct a national ground water assessment program to assist State and local governments in ground water protection and remediation of contamination and depletion and in the design of monitoring programs, including recommendations for protocols to assist such governments in meeting their data collection responsibilities under specified Federal environmental statutes. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish and coordinate a research, development, and demonstration program for ground water protection and remediation of contamination, to include surveys, the development of cost-effective prevention, detection, and remediation techniques, and the provision of technical assistance. Sets forth demonstration project selection criteria and procedures, based upon the seriousness of the contaminant addressed and a project's applicability to other locations and circumstances. Requires that such project be monitored and evaluated by the Administrator. Authorizes the Administrator to pay the costs of such evaluation, but limits Federal cost sharing for the project in general. Requires the Administrator to publish an environmental profile for each significant ground water contaminant. Requires such profiles to include information useful to State and local governments for assessing the risk to human health and the environment within a range of concentrations of such contaminants. Directs the Administrator to implement research programs for each contaminant for which an environmental profile is prepared, assist with risk management decisions, and supplement information needed to prepare such profiles. Requires the Administrator to publish a list of contaminants for which environmental profiles are proposed to be developed. Establishes a timetable for the publication of such profiles. Requires the Administrator, in publishing such profiles, to give priority to the most toxic contaminants. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator each to establish a technical assistance program to serve other Federal and governmental agencies, including assistance for research, surveys, training, and technology transfer. Directs the Secretary, acting through the U.S. Geological Survey, to establish and maintain a National Groundwater Information Clearinghouse. Directs the Administrator to establish a ground water research committee for ground water resources. Directs the Science Advisory Board established by the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1978 to review and report to the Congress on EPA's ground water research programs. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and maintain research fellowships. Directs the Administrator to make grants for ground water research institutes. Requires that funds be equitably distributed throughout the United States and that one of the institutes be the National Center for Ground Water Research, a consortium between Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and Rice Universities. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of costs and earmarks funds for technology transfer. Requires the Administrator to review and evaluate such institutes. Directs the Administrator to develop a program to improve the coordination and transfer of commercial pesticide application information from the EPA to the Department of Agriculture's State Extension Service. Requires the President to report annually to the Congress on activities carried out under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to support the development and implementation of State strategies designed to detect, prevent, and correct ground water contamination and eliminate or control sources on potential sources of contaminants. Sets forth allotment requirements. Limits such grants to 50 percent of a project's total cost. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1991 through 1994. Authorizes the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative, to award to a domestic firm a contract that, under the use of competitive procedures, would be awarded to a foreign firm, if: (1) the final product of the domestic firm will be completely assembled in the United States; (2) at least 51 percent of the final product will be domestically produced when completely assembled; and (3) the difference between the bids submitted by the foreign and domestic firms is not more than six percent. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on such contracts, contracts entered into with foreign entities, and contracts that meet such requirements but are in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or another international agreement."
