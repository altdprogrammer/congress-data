    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract for the provision of rehabilitative and therapeutic services to veterans with any appropriate source, whether or not such source is an element of the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other Federal entity. (Current law allows such contractual arrangements with private industry or other sources outside the Department.) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a three-year demonstration program for the provision of transitional housing for veterans receiving therapeutic or rehabilitative services through the Department and who are furnished therapeutic work as part of such services. Allows the Secretary to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire residential housing for such purposes. Limits the operation of such transitional housing to no more than 50 residences. Outlines conditions for such transitional housing, including the payment of rent for resident veterans. Requires a house manager for each residence used for such housing. Authorizes the Secretary to use any suitable residential property for such housing, including property acquired through default under the veterans' home loan guaranty program. Authorizes the Secretary to dispose of property after use as transitional housing and to deposit the proceeds into the General Post Fund of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to assist nonprofit organizations in providing transitional housing for veterans who are or recently have been in a program for the treatment of substance abuse. Outlines terms, conditions, and limitations to such loan program. Authorizes the Secretary to provide loans to veterans for the purpose of avoiding foreclosure of a housing loan made under the veterans' home loan guaranty program. Conditions such assistance on the following: (1) that the dwelling securing the loan is the current residence of the veteran; (2) that the veteran is at least six months' delinquent in payments on the original guaranteed loan; (3) that the veteran has lost employment or has had a substantial reduction in income through no fault of the veteran; and (4) the Secretary determines that there is a reasonable prospect that the veteran will be able to resume payment on the original loan within six months after receiving such loan assistance. Limits to $10,000 the total amount of such loans made to any veteran. Requires a veteran to enter into an agreement to repay such a loan within a reasonable period not to exceed 15 years. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations and States or political subdivisions to sell real property acquired as the result of a loan made, insured, or guaranteed by the Secretary under the veterans' home loan guaranty program. Provides the following conditions to such agreements: (1) that the Secretary determines that such action will not adversely affect the ability of the Department to fulfill its statutory mission with respect to the veterans' home loan guaranty program; (2) that the entity to which the property is sold agrees to utilize such property solely as a shelter primarily for homeless veterans and their families, to comply with all zoning laws, and to make no use of the property that is incompatible with the area; and (3) that the Secretary determines that there is no significant likelihood of the property being sold for a price sufficient to reduce the liability of the Department or the veteran who defaulted on the loan. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to assist veterans who are participants in a compensated work therapy program, to convey to nonprofit organizations and States and political subdivisions real property acquired by the Secretary as the result of default on a loan made or guaranteed by the Secretary under the veterans' home loan program. Allows conveyance of such property only to persons who enter into an agreement with the Secretary to employ veterans who are participants in a compensated work therapy program. Terminates such agreement authority as of September 30, 1993."
