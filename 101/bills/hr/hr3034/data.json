    "text": "Sacramento Area Flood Control Act of 1989 - Modifies the project for flood protection along the Sacramento River and its tributaries, in California, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1917 to: (1) provide flood protection to the Sacramento metropolitan area by constructing a flow through flood control only facility causing no permanent impoundment on the North Fork of the American River designed to not preclude enlargement to help meet hydroelectric power and local water supply needs, subject to obtaining appropriate non-Federal sponsorship of such purposes; (2) bring up to current design standards, modify, and extend the Sacramento River Flood Control project involving areas of the American River and its tributaries from Nimbus Dam downstream to the Sacramento River, and areas along the Sacramento River and its bypass system from the Feather River downstream to Freeport; (3) improve the operational efficiency of the Folsom Dam project; and (4) provide fish and wildlife mitigation as necessary. Provides for determining Federal and non-Federal costs and for crediting non-Federal interests with prior flood control construction work. Deauthorizes the Auburn Dam and the Folsom South Canal and incorporates existing features with the flood control project authorized by this Act. Requires the non-Federal flood control interests benefiting from the operation of Folsom Dam to bear any actual loss of revenues: (1) resulting from the operation of such dam for flood control at a level greater than 400,000 acre-feet of storage capacity; and (2) which would otherwise have been derived from the generation of hydroelectric power and the delivery of water. Authorizes the transfer of land, if needed, for flood control along the Sacramento River."
