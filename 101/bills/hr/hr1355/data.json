Authorizes the Attorney General to so designate a country (or part thereof) in cases of: (1) ongoing armed conflict; (2) natural disasters; or (3) extraordinary and temporary conditions. Directs the Attorney General to review the status of a designated country at least annually. Permits waiver of certain alien excludability provisions for humanitarian or family unity purposes or when otherwise in the public interest. Prohibits such waiver in cases involving certain drug offenses, national security, or Nazi persecutions. Makes an alien ineligible for such benefits if the alien: (1) has been convicted in the United States of certain crimes; or (2) has participated in persecution or is a threat to U.S. security. States that during such temporary residency an alien shall not be eligible for public assistance. Allows such an alien to travel abroad temporarily and work in the United States. States that the statutory procedure established by this Act shall be the Attorney General's exclusive authority to permit specified aliens to remain in the United States temporarily by virtue of their nationality. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the temporary residency program."
