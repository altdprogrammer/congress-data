Requires the Secretary of Commerce to hold public hearings and issue a comprehensive management plan for the Sanctuary. Declares that a person who operates a vessel shall not strike or otherwise damage the natural resources of the Sanctuary, pending completion of the comprehensive management plan.

Requires the Governor of Florida, the Secretary, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a water quality protection program for the Sanctuary. Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992.
