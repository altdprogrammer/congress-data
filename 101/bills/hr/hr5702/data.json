    "text": "Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health the Office of Minority Health, to be headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Deputy Assistant Secretary, with respect to the health concerns of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities, to carry out the duties of the office, including: (1) establishing goals and coordinating departmental activities; (2) increasing the participation of minorities in health service and promotion programs; (3) establishing a national minority health resource center to facilitate information exchange; (4) support research; and (5) develop health information and teaching programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants to provide to residents of public housing primary health services and health counseling and education services. Requires, subject to waiver, that services covered by Medicaid be provided by providers qualified to receive Medicaid payments. Requires that services be provided at locations immediately accessible to residents of public housing. Allows grant funds to be used to: (1) train public housing residents to provide health screenings and provide educational services; and (2) provide health services to individuals who are not residents of public housing under the same terms and conditions as applied to residents of public housing. Authorizes appropriations. Replaces provisions mandating grants to health professions schools for programs of excellence in education for minorities with similar provisions, adding detailed eligibility requirements. Designates a school receiving a grant as a Center of Excellence in Minority Health Professions Education, a Hispanic Center of Excellence in Health Professions Education, or a Native American Center of Excellence in Health Professions Education. Requires public and nonprofit private schools to maintain the level of non-Federal spending at least at the level of the preceding fiscal year, but applies that requirement to nonprofit private schools only to the extent of the non-Federal amounts available to the school. Authorizes appropriations. Requires that the Federal capital contribution to a student loan fund under existing provisions, the school contribution to the fund, and collected principal and interest be used only for making loans to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and for collection costs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to health professions schools for scholarships to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Allows a limited percentage of the grant amounts to be used to assist undergraduates committed to a career in the health professions. Sets forth requirements for schools which receive the Federal capital contributions or the grants for scholarships, including: (1) recruiting students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities, and minority faculty; (2) ensuring instruction on minority health issues; (3) making arrangements with secondary and undergraduate institutions regarding the educational preparation of disadvantaged students to enter the health professions; (4) providing students experience in clinics which provide services to a significant number of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds; and (5) establishing a mentor program.

Directs the Secretary to establish a program in which the Federal Government agrees to repay a limited amount of the educational loans of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who agree to serve as members of the faculties of eligible health professions schools. Requires, subject to waiver, that the school where an individual serves on the faculty agree to repay an amount equal to the Federal payment. Authorizes appropriations. Amends provisions relating to the National Center for Health Statistics to direct the Secretary to encourage States and registration areas to obtain detailed data on ethnic and racial populations, including subpopulations of Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Requires an annual collection of data from a statistically valid sample concerning the general health, illness, and disability of the civilian noninstitutionalized population. Specifies elements required to be addressed on an annual or periodic basis. Directs the Secretary to collect and analyze health data specific to particular ethnic and racial populations. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Center, to make grants, with regard to ethnic and racial populations and subpopulations, for: (1) the conduct of surveys or studies; (2) analysis of data; and (3) research on methods for developing statistics. Exempts such surveys or studies from provisions prohibiting the release of information if the establishment or person supplying the information is identifiable. Requires approval by a peer review group. Allows the group to include officers and employees of the United States. Authorizes appropriations for the activities of the National Center for Health Statistics. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants to States for demonstration programs to increase the availability of primary health care in health manpower shortage areas through assisting community organizations in educating individuals to serve as health professionals in such areas. Requires that the program carried out by a State be administered by a single State agency. Requires States to use the grants to make grants to community organizations located in health manpower shortage areas for the costs of contracts under which the organizations agree to provide scholarships to individuals for attendance at health professions schools and the individuals agree to provide primary health care in the area in which the organization is located. Requires that a scholarship recipient be a resident of that area. Requires States, in their applications, to estimate the allocations of funds between urban and rural areas. Directs the Secretary to reduce the amount of a grant to a State based on breached contracts. Directs the Secretary, if the State is not receiving a grant under these provisions during a fiscal year when a reduction would be required, to reduce payments under other grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts under the Public Health Service Act. Authorizes appropriations for the grants, earmarking at least 50 percent of amounts appropriated for rural health manpower shortage areas. Requires that community health centers which serve a substantial number of individuals with limited English-speaking ability provide the services of personnel fluent in the language spoken by a predominant number of those individuals. Removes similar provisions from the definition of \"supplemental health services.\" Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions relating to community health centers. Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions relating to migrant health centers. Directs the Secretary to make grants or enter into contracts with agencies with experience in serving the health needs of Pacific Islanders living in specified areas.
