    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-10-12", 
    "text": "California Desert Conservation Act of 1989 - Title I: Wilderness Additions - Designates 81 wilderness areas in California as additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Releases certain non-designated areas administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the California Desert District and the Yuma District from otherwise applicable restrictions. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from conducting any future wilderness studies of land released from wilderness review unless authorized by the Congress. Title II: Preservation of California Desert Back Country Trails - Establishes the California Desert Back Country Trails System. Designates the following trails as components of such trail system: (1) the Mojave Trail/Old Government Road; (2) the Heritage Trail; (3) the Tonapah and Tidewater Railroad Right-of-Way Route; (4) the Bradshaw Trail; (5) the de Anza Trail; (6) the Butterfield Stage Route; (7) the Yuma to Picacho Road; and (8) the Old Spanish Road. Title III: Withdrawal of Military Lands - Withdraws from appropriation under public land laws, but not the mineral and geothermal leasing laws, and reserves for military use by the Department of the Navy specified lands in California known as the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in Inyo, Kern, and San Bernardino Counties and Chocolate Mountain in Imperial County. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), every five years, to determine which such lands are suitable for opening to the operation of mining and mineral leasing laws. Opens such lands to such operation. Requires the Secretary to close such lands for purposes of national security. Provides that patents issued for locatable minerals shall convey title to such minerals only and shall reserve to the United States the surface of all patented lands and all nonlocatable minerals. Requires the Secretary to manage nonmilitary uses of, and to be responsible for, all easements, leases, permits, and rights-of-way over, the lands withdrawn and reserved under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary and the Secretary of the Navy to continue cooperative management practices over such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, to develop a land use plan and management program for Chocolate Mountain and China Lake within five years after this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to report annually on the natural resource status of China Lake's lands to the Secretary. Provides that the Secretary of the Navy shall have the authority to control the military use of the lands withdrawn and reserved under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to close roads and trails for military operations or safety or security purposes. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to prevent and suppress brush and range fires with reimbursable assistance from the Bureau of Land Management. Makes the Secretary of the Navy responsible for the management of wild horses and burros on China Lake and allows the Secretary of the Navy to utilize mineral resources for construction needs. Requires the Secretaries to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement the plan and program developed for Chocolate Mountain. Declares that land withdrawals are not intended to: (1) withdraw any water for specified defense related uses; (2) affect future appropriation of water on such lands; and (3) affect water rights acquired by the Department of Defense prior to the enactment of this Act for use in military operations at China Lake and Chocolate Mountain. Terminates land withdrawals under this Act 25 years after this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to maintain a decontamination program for such lands during their withdrawal. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on such decontamination efforts. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to notify the Secretary, at least three years before the termination of the withdrawal, whether an extension is going to be requested and, if not, to what extent such lands are contaminated with hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to decontaminate relinquished lands, but if such decontamination is not practicable or economically feasible, authorizes the Secretary to refuse to accept such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to then: (1) warn the public of risks of entry; (2) conduct only decontamination activities on such lands after the expiration of the withdrawal; and (3) report to the Secretary and the Congress on the status of such lands. Directs the Secretary to publish the acceptance of withdrawn lands, indicating when such lands will be open and under what conditions. Exempts the United States from liability for injuries or damages resulting from nonmilitary activity on withdrawn lands. Amends the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 to correct \"Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Base\" to read \"Luke Air Force Base\" as a depository for certain maps and legal descriptions of public lands withdrawn for military purposes. Authorizes an extension of the Navy's use of the El Centro Ranges in Imperial County, California, through 1989, subject to resource protection requirements. Directs the Secretary to complete land exchanges between the Nature Conservancy and the Bureau of Land Management concerning the Coachella Valley Preserve. Continues the status of the U.S. Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center in the Toiyabe National Forest, California, as both a training center and as part of such Forest, subject to resource protection requirements."
