Prohibits any establishment or vessel from processing seafood (any aquatic plant or animal capable of use as human food) unless registered under the program. Requires all seafood labeling to be approved by the Secretary prior to use. Provides for the inspection of establishments and vessels registered under the program and for condemnation of adulterated or misbranded seafood. Requires the Secretary, with the Secretary of Commerce, to establish a system to sample and test seafood and seafood products to identify geographical areas having significant quantities of products not in compliance with this Act. Imposes standards, inspection requirements, and sampling requirements on imported seafood and seafood products. Requires the Secretary to review, upon request, the seafood inspection program of countries desiring to export products to the United States. Sets U.S. seafood export standards. Directs the Secretary to encourage States to establish seafood inspection programs, providing Federal assistance for such programs. Prescribes prohibited acts relating to seafood processing, sale, and transport, imposing civil and criminal penalties for violations. Exempts carriers from penalties for delivery of adulterated or misbranded seafood and products unless certain knowledge and other requirements are met. Exempts from this Act establishments and vessels processing seafood not intended for use as human food, intended for personal use, for certain restaurant processing, and vessels that do not process seafood by certain methods. Directs the implementation of a national program for seafood safety education. Authorizes appropriations. Requires reports to the Congress."
