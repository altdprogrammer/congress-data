    "text": "Eliminates a legal impediment to the consideration by the Secretary of the Interior of any petition by an organization representing the Lumbee Indians or other Indians residing in certain North Carolina counties for acknowledgement as an Indian tribe. Makes such impediment inapplicable to any group or organization whose petition for acknowledgement as an Indian tribe has been approved by the Secretary. Requires the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs to publish a proposed finding with respect to the petition for acknowledgement as an Indian tribe submitted by the Lumbee Regional Development Association on December 17, 1987, not later than 18 months after the petitioner notifies the Assistant Secretary that he or she has fully responded to the notice of obvious deficiencies regarding that petition. Allows the petitioner to treat the failure of the Assistant Secretary to publish such findings within such period as a final agency action denying acknowledgement. Provides for judicial review if the Assistant Secretary publishes a final decision refusing to acknowledge the Indians petitioning for recognition. Provides that the number of persons on the membership roll in the petition submitted by the Lumbee Regional Development Association may not be taken into account in considering such petition, except that the Assistant Secretary may review the eligibility of such persons in accordance with Federal regulations. Requires the State of North Carolina to exercise jurisdiction over all criminal offenses committed, and all civil actions that arise, on specified lands in North Carolina of an Indian tribe acknowledged pursuant to the Lumbee Regional Development Association petition. Expresses the sense of the Congress that review of the Lumbee Regional Development Association petition should not delay the review of other petitions for acknowledgement awaiting active consideration as of February 1, 1990."
