    "text": "Entitles members of the armed forces of Canada who served during World War I or II and participated in armed conflict with an enemy of the United States and who have been citizens of the United States for at least ten years to veterans' hospital or domiciliary care and medical services, as long as such persons are not entitled to such care under a program established by the Government of Canada. Authorizes the provision of a non-service-connected disability pension to such members who have resided in the United States for ten years or more, but are not citizens, provided they otherwise meet the eligibility criteria. Requires each applicant for either of such benefits to first obtain from the Government of Canada records which clearly indicate such military service with the Canadian armed forces."
