    "text": "Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Amendments of 1989 - Amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) of the Social Security Act to increase authorized appropriations under such title. Adds the promotion and provision of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children with special health care needs to the purposes to which title V block grants to States shall be devoted. Increases amounts set aside from the block grant program to enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and expand: (1) maternal and infant health home visiting programs; (2) integrated maternal and child health service delivery systems; (3) maternal and child health centers; and (4) maternal and child health projects serving rural populations. Authorizes States to use block grant funds to pay the salaries of National Health Service Corps personnel. Prohibits States from using more than ten percent of block grant funds for administering such funds. Requires States to use at least: (1) 30 percent of block grant funds for preventive and primary care for pregnant women, mothers, and infants; (2) 30 percent of such funds for preventive and primary care for children; and (3) 30 percent of such funds on children with special health care needs. Permits a waiver of such requirement if a State demonstrates an extraordinary unmet need for one of the activities. Requires State agencies administering a State's title V program to assist individuals who are eligible for assistance under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act in applying for Medicaid benefits. Requires title V providers to provide Medicaid services. Imposes maternal and child health reporting requirements on States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Provides States with Federal, technical assistance in developing consistent and accurate maternal and child health data collection mechanisms. Directs the Secretary to develop: (1) a model application form for use in applying, simultaneously, for assistance for a pregnant woman or a child under age six under specified maternal and child assistance programs; and (2) a national system for linking an infant's birth record, such infant's death record, and information on Medicaid claims submitted with respect to such infant or his or her birth."
