Exempts Aleutian trade and certain fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels from specified inspection requirements. Modifies safety requirements for documented vessels, including Aleutian trade. Excludes Aleutian trade from provisions relating to load lines. Provides for certain manning requirements, including those relating to watches, crew requirements, and merchant mariner's documents."
