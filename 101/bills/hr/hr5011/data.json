Details the information and assurances required to be included in State applications to conduct such projects. Authorizes each State which receives project grants to use such funds to improve the provision of child welfare, foster care, and adoption assistance services in any manner it deems appropriate. Provides for the evaluation of such demonstration projects. Makes part B (Child-Welfare Services) and the section of part E of title IV not added by this Act inapplicable to a State while it is conducting such a demonstration project."
