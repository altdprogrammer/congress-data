    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an international research, development, and production center at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, Washington, to be known as the International Research Reactor User Complex (IRRC). Allows the Department of Energy (DOE), and any contractors operating the IRRC, to enter into agreements with non-Federal entities, including foreign governments and entities, or a consortium of such entities, for use of the IRRC relating to production of isotopes, irradiation services, and the production of steam. Allows the Secretary to assess charges from those entities as necessary. Limits the agreements to 25 years. Allows the agreement to: (1) include a termination provision requiring the DOE to pay for the unamortized balance of certain facilities in some circumstances; and (2) authorize the use, to make the repayments, of funds made available for operating expenses. Allows the Secretary, in entering into an agreement, to use procedures other than competitive procedures as described in specified provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Requires any entity under contract to operate the IRRC to operate the Fast Flux Test Facility pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act and meet other requirements. Exempts the activities authorized under this Act from licensing or regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Establishes in the Treasury the IRRC Fund to consist of all amounts received under the assessments under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to use Fund amounts to offset IRRC operating costs."
