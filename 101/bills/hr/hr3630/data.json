    "text": "Emergency Substance Abuse Treatment Improvement Act of 1990 - Title I: Office for Treatment Improvement - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish in the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration the Office for Treatment Improvement. Sets forth the duties of the Office, including: (1) identifying individuals in need of treatment; (2) studying treatment outcomes; and (3) promoting the dissemination and implementation of research findings. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the Office to: (1) make three- to five-year grants for demonstration projects to improve the provision of substance abuse treatment services; (2) make grants for drug and alcohol treatment services to individuals under criminal justice supervision; and (3) develop programs to increase the number of full-time substance abuse treatment professionals and the number of health professionals providing treatment services through the awarding of grants. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a three-year renewable demonstration grant for the establishment, within the national capital area, of a model program for comprehensive treatment services for drug abuse. Requires that grant recipients be, or have the participation of, local governments in the communities in which the services will be offered. Allows the grantee to provide services directly or through arrangements with other entities. Requires non-Federal contributions in a specified ratio. Substitutes, in provisions authorizing appropriations, references to reducing the waiting period for drug treatment for references to model projects for pregnant and post partum women and their infants. Repeals provisions relating to drug abuse demonstration projects of national significance. Adds to the list of allowed drug abuse demonstration projects that of: (1) determining the effects of drug abuse among pregnant women and the resulting effects on their infants; and (2) outreach to intravenous drug abusers regarding preventing exposure to and transmission of the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and encouraging intravenous drug abusers to seek treatment. Replaces provisions directing the Secretary, in making drug abuse demonstration projects, to give special consideration to drug abuse among pregnant women with provisions directing the Secretary, in making such grants, to make a competitive grant to support: (1) an epidemiological study of infants and the families of infants with fetal cocaine syndrome; and (2) longitudinal study of those infants and their families. Title II: Office for Substance Abuse Prevention - Directs the Secretary, through the Director of the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, to make grants for demonstration projects to provide to pregnant and postpartum women and their infants prevention, education, and treatment services regarding substance abuse, including: (1) outreach to identify those in need of the services and encourage them to undergo treatment; (2) health care for the women and their infants and children; (3) child care, transportation, and other support services; (4) employment counseling; and (5) case management. Requires that the services: (1) be provided at locations accessible to low-income women; (2) be provided in the language and the cultural context that is most appropriate; and (3) which are covered by title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act be provided by an entity which is qualified to receive Medicare payments. Limits the imposition of charges for services. Requires non-Federal contributions in specified ratios. Limits grants to five years; allows renewals. Makes the payments subject to annual approval by the Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary from discriminating against applicants who provide treatment to women that receive treatment by order of a court, subject to the availability of qualified applicants. Title III: Revision of Program of Block Grants Regarding Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Other Matters - Adds to the allowed uses of alcohol and drug abuse and mental health services block grants that of developing and operating programs of treatment for adult and juvenile substance abusers in State and local criminal and juvenile justice systems, including treatment programs for individuals in prisons and jails and those on probation, parole, supervised release, and pretrial release. Replaces provisions prohibiting using the funds for distributing needles for injecting illegal drugs or bleach for cleaning needles with provisions prohibiting distributing needles or syringes unless the Surgeon General determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk of infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Excludes expenses for the training of individuals as required by existing provisions from the determination of the level of administrative expenses. Revises requirements regarding maintenance of the level of State expenditures for alcohol, drug abuse, and community mental health services. Changes the percentage of the block grant set-aside for alcohol and drug abuse programs and services designed for women. Requires that a State ensure that treatment services are available to each pregnant woman in the State who seeks or is referred to and would benefit from the services. Requires that States meeting certain requirements identify each locality in which intravenous drug use or crack use is prevalent and designate at least one facility in each such locality in which certain services will be offered and encouraged, if necessary at State expense. Requires a State to develop, implement, and submit, as part of its block grant allotment application, a statewide Substance Abuse Treatment Plan. Requires the Plan to be submitted to the Secretary annually for review and approval."
