Authorizes the President to permit Central European countries (defined for purposes of this Act as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia) with emerging market economies to pay debt owed to the United States into local currency trust accounts to be used for environmental protection and economic development projects. Directs the President to treat each Central European country on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the need of the country for financial resources and the commitment to carrying out such projects."
