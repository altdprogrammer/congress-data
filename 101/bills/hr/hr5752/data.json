    "text": "Steven McDonald Public Safety Officers' Compensation Act of 1990 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Bureau of Justice Assistance to pay a lump sum benefit of $100,000 to any public safety officer who has become permanently and totally disabled as a direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. Bars the payment of benefits under such Act with respect to: (1) the death of a public safety officer if a benefit is paid with respect to the disability of such officer; (2) the disability of such officer if a benefit is paid with respect to the death of such officer; and (3) personal injuries under other specified situations, such as where such officer was voluntarily intoxicated or was grossly negligent at the time of injury. Deletes from the definition of \"firefighter\" for purposes of benefit provisions the requirement that a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew be \"responding to a fire, rescue or police emergency.\""
