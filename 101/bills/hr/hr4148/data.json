Requires the Secretary to use such water in Maricopa, Pinal, and Pima Counties to settle water rights claims involving the United States, Indian communities, and appropriate third parties with priority to the Fort McDowell Indian Community and other tribes having claims to the surface water of the Salt and Verde River system. Authorizes the Secretary to provide credit and offset repayment requirements for the Harquahala District and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District as consideration for the fair market value of such water rights."
