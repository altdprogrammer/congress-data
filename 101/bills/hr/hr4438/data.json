    "date": "1990-03-29", 
    "text": "Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to repeal a provision concerning the expiration of authority to make coastal zone management grants to States. Removes a requirement that coastal States expend an increasing proportion of administrative grants on specified coastal zone activities in order to receive such grants. Deletes provisions concerning the segmental development of coastal zone management programs and the inclusion of standards for coastal resources of national significance in such programs. Defines \"National Priority Program Element\" as: (1) enhanced wetland protection and restoration; (2) prevention and mitigation of risks to life and property from coastal hazards and of nonpoint source pollution; and (3) management of beach and marine debris to reduce coastal zone pollution. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to coastal States for the implementation of coastal zone management program changes supporting the National Program Priority Elements. Limits the amounts of such grants to be used for such changes. Permits the Secretary to suspend payment and withdraw any unexpended portion of financial assistance to a State if the State is failing to adhere to: (1) a management program or national estuarine reserve management program; or (2) the terms of any grant or cooperative agreement. (Current law requires the Secretary to reduce such assistance by a specified amount if the State is failing to achieve certain coastal management objectives.) Revises notice requirements with respect to such suspensions. Provides that such suspensions shall last between six and 36 months. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any person (currently, coastal States) for educational or interpretive activities related to a natural estuarine reserve. Authorizes appropriations for various activities under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972."
