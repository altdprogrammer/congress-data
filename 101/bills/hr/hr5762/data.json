    "text": "Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to implement the Caribbean Regional Development Act of 1990. Sets forth U.S. policy with respect to development and economic assistance for the Caribbean. Provides that priority in providing development assistance should be given to supporting indigenous democratic Caribbean institutions that represent and benefit the poor. Requires priority in the allocation of assistance to the Caribbean to be given to: (1) increased food production; (2) rural development; (3) community-based agro-industries; (4) small- and medium-sized farm and manufacturing enterprises; (5) the expansion of tourism; (6) regional integration; (7) the upgrading of technical and managerial skills; (8) support for renewable natural resources; (9) private sector development; (10) democratic development and the administration of justice; and (11) human services and human resources development. Directs the President, in providing assistance to a Caribbean country, to take into account whether the government of such country has failed to protect worker rights and is taking steps to implement laws that demonstrate advancement in providing such rights. Prohibits the Agency for International Development (AID) from providing assistance for the use of any substance in a Caribbean country if such use is prohibited under the country's or U.S. public health laws. Declares that AID should ensure the active participation of women in the development process. States that AID should: (1) take into account the perspectives of the poor in the development process; and (2) monitor socioeconomic conditions in the Caribbean and the effect of U.S. assistance on such conditions."
