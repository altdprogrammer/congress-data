    "text": "Great Lakes Oilspill Prevention Act - Title I: Great Lakes Oilspill Response - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) review Federal, State, local, and private oilspill contingency plans for the Great Lakes region; and (2) report to the Congress any changes in such plans to better protect the Great Lakes environment and natural resources from the effects of an oilspill. Requires the Secretary to consult with specified entities with expertise in oilspill response and containment. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Congress a report on existing Federal, State, and local oilspill response capabilities. Title II: Great Lakes Vessel Manning - Authorizes a member of a vessel to serve as the pilot required in Great Lakes waters not designated by the President for the route being navigated, if such member is: (1) a U.S. citizen who has a pilot license; or (2) a Canadian citizen who has an equivalent pilot license. Authorizes a vessel to operate in waters of the Great Lakes without a U.S. or Canadian registered pilot when the Secretary notifies the master that a registered pilot is not available, except for specified regulated vessels. Makes vessels liable in rem for rates and charges for pilotage services and any costs of collection. Increases the penalties for owners of vessels who permit such a vessel to navigate in the waters of the Great Lakes without a U.S. or Canadian registered pilot. Requires the Secretary, with respect to vessels operating in waters of the Great Lakes, to: (1) review the training and watchstanding standards for individuals employed on such vessels; (2) transmit to the Congress provisions of international conventions and U.S. laws that apply; and (3) make appropriate recommendations on necessary changes to manning requirements to reduce the risk of vessel casualty that may result in oilspill damage to the Great Lakes environment. Title III: Great Lakes Navigation Safety - Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the imposition of fees for examining foreign vessels for compliance with certain navigational safety standards. Sets forth civil penalties."
