    "text": "Title I: Pay-As-You-Go-Budget - Budget Reform Act of 1989 - Prohibits the President's budget and that adopted by the Congress in a concurrent resolution on the budget from including: (1) total budget outlays that exceed those for the preceding fiscal year, unless at least equivalent revenue increases and their sources are identified; and (2) a reduction in revenues from the preceding fiscal year, unless at least equivalent reductions in outlays are identified, along with the affected programs. Authorizes the Congress to waive the prohibition with respect to its budget resolution by a two-thirds vote. Makes it out of order in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to consider a concurrent budget resolution under which fiscal year revenues exceed outlays, unless the purposes for which the excess is to be allocated are specified. Title II: Biennial Budget - Biennial Budgeting Act of 1989 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, and other Federal law to revise the Federal budget process by: (1) establishing a two-year budgeting and appropriations cycle and timetable, beginning in the 102d Congress; and (2) requiring separate consideration of authorizations, appropriations, the concurrent resolution on the budget, and the reconciliation bill or resolution. Devotes the first session of any Congress to committee work and includes the following deadlines: (1) June 30 for completion of oversight hearings and reports; (2) July 1 for beginning legislative work for the two-year budget period; (3) November 30 for the Budget Committee report of the concurrent resolution on the budget; and (4) December 1 for committee reports of legislation authorizing new budget authority and providing new spending authority. Establishes the following deadlines, among others, with respect to the second session: (1) March 10 for completion of congressional action on authorization legislation; (2) March 31 for completion of congressional action on the concurrent resolution on the budget; (3) April 15 for Appropriations Committee reports of legislation providing new budget authority; (4) the week following Labor Day for completion of congressional action on legislation involving new budget and entitlement authority; and (5) September 25 for completion of congressional action on reconciliation legislation implementing the budget resolution. Directs each standing committee of the Congress to review the laws and programs under its jurisdiction in every odd-numbered year to determine whether they should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated and whether new legislation is necessary to comply with congressional intent. Conforms provisions governing the President's budget to the biennial framework. Directs the President to transmit to the Congress during the first 15 days of the second session any budget revisions with respect to the budget transmitted in the first session. Title III: Line Item Veto - Grants the President, for the two-year period following this Act's enactment, line item veto authority with respect to appropriations legislation, except for any item of appropriation for the legislative or judicial branch of the Government."
