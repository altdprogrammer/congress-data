Authorizes the rent maximum to be increased yearly by the same percentage by which retired pay of members and former members of the armed forces is increased for such year. Provides for a stay of such a court action in the case of a member of the reserves called to active duty for a period of more than 30 days. Requires such reserve member to pay as rent an amount equal to the sum of any basic allowance for quarters and variable housing allowance received for such period of active duty. Provides for the repayment of agreed rent that is unpaid during the period of active duty after such period is completed."
