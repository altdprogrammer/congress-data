    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to any group of individuals affected by a release of hazardous waste from solid waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities having or seeking permits under such Act. Permits such grants to be used for technical assistance to: (1) interpret information with respect to the nature of the release; (2) investigate the release or monitor a facility owner or operator in investigating such release; and (3) make recommendations to the Administrator on corrective actions to be taken at the facility. Limits the amount of such grants. Requires grant recipients to contribute a specified percentage of the costs of technical assistance. Waives such limitations and contribution requirements under specified circumstances. Prohibits the provision of more than one grant to a single facility, but authorizes grant renewals at all stages of corrective action."
