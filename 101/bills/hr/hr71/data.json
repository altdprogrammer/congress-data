Excludes such contributions from the resources of SSI recipients. Makes this Act's income exclusions applicable under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to notify SSI applicants and recipients of the opportunities this Act provides them to exercise greater independence and the applicability of the reduction in SSI eligibility thresholds and benefits to individuals living in another person's household and receiving support and maintenance from such person."
