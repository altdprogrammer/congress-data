    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1989-11-07", 
    "text": "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 - Provides that authorizations of appropriations and of personnel strength levels in this Act for any fiscal year after 1990 are effective only with respect to appropriations made during the first session of the 101st Congress. Limits the net amount authorized to be expended during FY 1990 from certain covered defense appropriations. Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence to ensure compliance with such limitation. Requires the Secretary to ensure that outlay rates for congressional interest items are not reduced during FY 1990 to implement such limitation. Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate and House Armed Services and Appropriations Committees on implementation of such limitation. Requires the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget and of the Congressional Budget Office to submit to the Speaker of the House and specified congressional committees a joint report concerning outlays and budget authority for that fiscal year. Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to required reductions and other changes in national defense outlays in relation to budget authority. Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Part A: Funding Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 to the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, and Air Force for: (1) aircraft; (2) missiles; (3) weapons and tracked combat vehicles; (4) ammunition; (5) shipbuilding and conversion; (6) other procurement; and (7) the installation of modernization equipment. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 for: (1) procurement for the defense agencies and the reserves; and (2) the chemical demilitarization program. Specifies programs for which the Secretary of the military department concerned may and may not use funds appropriated for FY 1990 to enter into multiyear procurement contracts for specified defense procurement programs. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to reduce or increase various defense procurement program authorizations under such Act. Part B: B-2 Aircraft Program - Limits the amount of FY 1990 Air Force funds which may be obligated for procurement of B-2 aircraft and spare parts. Prohibits such funds from being made available until a series of flight testing is completed and certain certifications are made with regard to the results of such tests. Prohibits the annual production of B-2 aircraft for fiscal years after FY 1990 unless certain certifications with regard to performance and testing milestones having been met. Requires the U.S. Comptroller General to conduct an ongoing evaluation of B-2 test and evaluation results and report periodically to the Congress on his findings. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Senate and House Armed Services and Appropriations Committees (the defense committees) on the cost, schedule, and capability of the B-2 aircraft program. Requires the Secretary to provide for an ongoing independent assessment of the technological capabilities and performance of the B-2 aircraft and submit periodic reports to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to submit to the defense committees an unclassified version of the B-2 performance matrix. Requires the Secretary to: (1) report to the defense committees on the implementation of certain contractor guarantee requirements with respect to B-2 aircraft procurement contracts; and (2) conduct a comprehensive study of the force structure of the B-2 aircraft. Expresses the sense of the Congress with regard to initial and full-rate production of B-2 aircraft, with emphasis on less use of the B-2 and more use of certain alternative aircraft in the future. Part C: Other Strategic Programs - Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to proceed with the recovery program for the B-1B aircraft electronic countermeasures program only in accordance with the following conditions: (1) testing by the Secretary of Defense during FY 1990 and 1991 of the B-1B avionics modifications; (2) implementation of such modifications by the Secretary of the Air Force to not more than six B-1B aircraft; (3) bimonthly status reports by the Secretary of Defense with respect to the B-1B avionics modifications; and (4) an independent assessment by an outside panel, after completion of the test program, of the capabilities of the B-1B aircraft to penetrate air defenses of the Soviet Union. Provides funding for the avionics modification program. Requires certain testing and certifications before FY 1990 Air Force funds may be obligated for procurement of missiles under the Advanced Cruise Missile program. Limits to 50 the number of MX missiles that may be deployed at any one time. Part D: Program Terminations - Directs the Secretary of Defense to terminate new production of F-14 aircraft under specified conditions which include the production of spare parts for existing aircraft and the production of such aircraft for which funds were already obligated before the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to terminate new production of the following aircraft, with specified exceptions and conditions: (1) AH-64 helicopters; (2) AHIP Scout aircraft; (3) F-15 aircraft; (4) M88A2 recovery vehicles; and (5) reconnaissance aircraft.

Directs the President to prescribe regulations to implement the SSBP. Authorizes an eligible retired or former member of the armed forces to participate in the SBP during an open enrollment period. Allows such person, at the same time, to also elect to participate in the SSBP. Defines as eligible a person who on the day before the first day of the open enrollment period is not a participant in the SBP and is either entitled to retired pay or would be so entitled but for the fact that such member or former member is under 60 years of age (for reserve members or former members). Allows a person who is a participant in the SBP but not at the maximum base amount while providing coverage for a dependent child but not for a spouse or former spouse to: (1) elect to participate in the SBP at a higher amount; or (2) elect to provide an annuity under the SBP for a spouse or former spouse. Authorizes current SBP participants to elect to participate in the SSBP during the open enrollment period. Outlines those persons eligible to make such an election and sets limitations on eligibility for certain SBP participants not affected by the two-tier annuity computation (a computation that differentiates in the annuity amount depending on whether the annuitant has attained the age of 65). Requires any SSBP election to be made in writing, signed by the person making the election, and received by the Secretary concerned before the end of the open enrollment period. Defines the open enrollment period as the one-year period beginning on October 1, 1991.
