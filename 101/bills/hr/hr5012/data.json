Requires the Marty II Unit to irrigate Indian lands in the Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation. Allows both units to be utilized for rural water supplies via agreements between the Secretary and any rural water supply system operators. Requires the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses incurred as the result of the construction of such units. Directs the Secretary to carry out a demonstration program to: (1) develop an accurate and definitive means of quantifying projected irrigation and drainage requirements with respect to glacial till and other soils found in the areas to be served with irrigation water by such units; (2) develop best water use and management techniques and technologies for such soils; (3) investigate and demonstrate the potential for enhancement of fish and wildlife and wetlands in the unit areas; and (4) investigate and demonstrate the suitability of glacial till soils for crop production under irrigation. Requires study sites for the carrying out of such program to be obtained through voluntary leases with landowners, under specified conditions. Requires reports from the Secretary concerning the demonstration program. Concludes such demonstration program after the fifth full irrigation season. Requires certain planning reports and environmental impact statements with respect to the construction of the units and the demonstration program. Requires, both with respect to construction of the units and the carrying out of the demonstration program, that preference be given in employment to members of the Yankton-Sioux Indian Tribe. Provides for the sharing of the cost of constructing the Lake Andes-Wagner Unit between the United States, South Dakota, and the Lake Andes-Wagner Irrigation District. Authorizes appropriations for the construction of each unit, the demonstration program, and the operation and maintenance of each unit."
