    "text": "Child Care Incentives Act of 1989 - Title I: Child Care Services Grant - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992 for allotments to States to make grants to eligible entities for child care related projects. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make allotments to States through a formula based on the number of children living in a household whose income is not greater than 200 percent of the poverty level, adjusted for family size. Sets the Federal share at 80 percent of the project grants. Makes eligible for such grants: (1) local government units, including school districts; (2) nonprofit organizations; (3) professional or employee associations; (4) small business consortia; (5) higher education institutions; (6) hospitals or health care facilities; (7) family care providers; (8) parents, for use for employment-related or education-related expenses for child care by a registered, licensed, or accredited provider; or (9) entities the State considers able and appropriate to carry out such a project. Allows a State to make such grants to eligible entities for: (1) scholarships enabling low-income families to obtain adequate child care; (2) community or neighborhood child care centers, including renovation of public buildings for such purposes; (3) grants or loans for start-up costs of employer-sponsored child care programs; (4) training programs for child care providers; (5) temporary care of sick children unable to attend their regular child care programs; (6) expansion of existing part-day child care programs into full-day child care programs; (7) child care programs for homeless children; and (8) child care programs linked with programs to assist the elderly. Sets forth limitations on State use of allotments. Requires States to meet specified certification requirements, including establishment of standards of accreditation or licensing for family-based and group child care providers, and methods of inspection and certification based on such standards. Requires annual State reports. Directs the Secretary to summarize State reports annually for the Congress. Requires grant recipients to cover between ten percent and 50 percent of the project cost with non-Federal funds. Requires States to give grant priority to programs and projects designed to operate in succeeding years without receiving such grants. Directs each State Governor to establish an advisory council on child care. Applies specified provisions of the Social Security Act to this title. Title II: Revolving Loan Fund - Provides assistance for State-established revolving loan funds to enable family-based child care providers to meet accreditation or licensing standards. Requires each applicant State in its plan for such assistance to have established a revolving loan fund along with specified procedures and guidelines. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990, to remain available for assistance to States for FY 1990 through 1992. Directs the Secretary to make allotments to States through a formula based on the number of children. Title III: Miscellaneous Federal Child Care Provisions - Establishes the President's Award for Responsive Management Policy to honor public and private sector employers who have: (1) successfully implemented in their businesses family-oriented personnel programs and policies responsive to child care needs of working parents; or (2) made significant contributions to child care projects in their communities. Directs the President, through the Secretary of Labor, to solicit nominations. Directs the Secretary to coordinate all activities of the Department of Health and Human Services relating to child care, together with similar activities of other Federal agencies."
