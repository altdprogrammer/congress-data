    "text": "Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 - Title I: Multilateral Economic Assistance - Makes appropriations for FY 1991 for the U.S. contribution to the: (1) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank); (2) International Development Association; (3) International Finance Corporation; (4) Inter-American Development Bank; (5) Inter-American Investment Corporation; (6) Asian Development Fund; (7) African Development Fund; (8) African Development Bank; (9) European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and (10) Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Requires 25 percent of World Bank funds to be withheld from obligation until the Secretary of the Treasury reports to the Appropriations Committees on the actions the Bank has taken, and is contemplating, in support of energy, forestry conservation, and family planning activities. Limits the subscriptions to the callable capital portion of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Reduces from the amount obligated for the International Development Association the U.S. share of any loans approved (after 1989) for China for non-basic human needs. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank to oppose assistance to any recipient who refuses to agree to conduct procurement using Bank funds in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of nationality against any person interested in providing goods or services. Makes appropriations for FY 1991 for international organizations and programs. Prohibits funds from being made available to the Unitd Nations Fund for Science and Technology. Earmarks specified amounts of such funds for certain international organizations and United Nations programs. Provides that such funds may be made available to the International Atomic Energy Agency only if the Secretary of State reports to the Congress that Israel is not being denied its right to participate in the Agency. Permits funds to be made available for the Tropical Forestry Action Plan (TFAP) only if the Secretary of State reports to the Congress that: (1) TFAP has been reorganized with an international steering committee and secretariat independent of the Food and Agriculture Organization; (2) TFAP's responsibilities include areas outside the forestry sector; and (3) procedures exist to ensure increased participation in TFAP plans by affected populations and individuals outside the forestry sector. Title II: Bilateral Economic Assistance - Makes appropriations for FY 1991 for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition development assistance.
