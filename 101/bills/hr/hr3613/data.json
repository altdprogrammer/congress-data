    "text": "Upper Sacramento River Fishery Resources Restoration Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a ten-year program to restore salmon and steelhead trout populations of the Sacramento River (and its California tributaries and its drainage basin above the confluence with the Feather River) to the optimum carrying capacity of the habitat in a restored condition and to provide sufficient hatchery-produced fish to meet fishery restoration and mitigation requirements that cannot be satisfied by natural production. Requires memoranda of agreement with Federal, State, and local agencies having jurisdiction over certain necessary activities. Requires the Secretary's responsibilities under this Act, except for those related to construction and operation of facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, be carried out through the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Establishes the Upper Sacramento River Fisheries Task Force to assist the Secretary and coordinate activities with governmental and private anadromous fish restoration projects within the basin. Terminates the Task Force on September 30, 2000. Authorizes appropriations for formulation, establishment, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the program. Requires cost sharing from California and the electric utilities, water districts, and other direct purchasers of water and power from the Central Valley Project. Prohibits use of amounts appropriated under these provisions to protect fisheries from chronic or acute toxicity caused by heavy metals or acid mine drainage."
