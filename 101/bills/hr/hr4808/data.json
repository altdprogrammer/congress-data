Sets forth general qualification, certification application, and construction deadline requirements for such facilities. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to modify the definition of a uranium enrichment production facility to preclude any equipment or device capable of separating uranium isotopes or enriching uranium in isotope 235. Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to prescribe regulations for the control, ownership, or possession of any equipment or device, or important component part specifically designed for such equipment, capable of separating uranium isotopes or enriching uranium in isotope 235. Establishes criminal penalties for the sabotage of a uranium enrichment facility licensed by the Commission. Declares that the issuance of a uranium enrichment facility license shall be considered a major Federal action requiring an environmental impact statement.
