Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to replace provisions authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to acquire suitable vessels in exchange for obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) with provisions authorizing the Secretary to acquire suitable vessels with funds in the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund derived from the sale of obsolete vessels in the NDRF."
