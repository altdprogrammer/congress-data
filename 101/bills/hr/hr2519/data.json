Requires the Secretary to: (1) notify the President of any negative determination; and (2) publish it in the Federal Register. Requires the President, after receiving a negative determination for any elephant-producing country, to revoke most-favored-nation treatment for all products of that country. Makes it unlawful for any person to import or export ivory products. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should instruct U.S. representatives to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to obtain the consensus of the Contracting Parties to such Agreement regarding sanctions to reduce or eliminate international trade in endangered and threatened species products."
