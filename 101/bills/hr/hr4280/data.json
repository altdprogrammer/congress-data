    "text": "Health Insurance for Children and Mothers Act of 1990 - Establishes a health insurance program under a new title XXI of the Social Security Act which is to be financed by an increase in the payroll tax paid by employers and employees and cover children under age 23 and pregnancy-related care for all women. Provides the same benefits to children as are provided to individuals entitled to benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) and enrolled under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. Waives the application of deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments to normal newborn care, pediatrician services for high-risk deliveries, routine office visits, routine immunizations, routine laboratory tests, and preventive dental care provided to children under title XXI. Covers prenatal care, inpatient labor and delivery services, postnatal care, and postnatal family planning services for all women under title XXI without the application of deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments. Requires peer review organization authorization prior to the delivery of such pregnancy-related items and services which are not routine, common, or delivered in exigent circumstances. Sets forth payment provisions which include an incentive for first trimester prenatal care and a disincentive for cesarean sections. Establishes the Children and Mothers Health Insurance Trust Fund which shall be administered by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and into which funds collected by the increase in the payroll tax shall be paid. Makes various provisions regarding the administration of the Medicare program applicable to the health insurance program for children and mothers under title XXI."
