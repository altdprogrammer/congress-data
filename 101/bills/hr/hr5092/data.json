Requires such study to identify: (1) land and other assets to convey to Native corporations organized by the Native residents of the villages accorded such status; (2) the means to fund such corporations. Directs the Secretary to submit any legislation necessary to implement such study to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources."
