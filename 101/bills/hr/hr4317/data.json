    "text": "Public Hospitals and Schools Alien Compensation Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a grant to, or enter into a contract with, an eligible public hospital to compensate the hospital, partially or fully, for unreimbursed expenses incurred by the hospital in providing emergency medical services to presumptive aliens. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make a grant to, or enter into a contract with, any eligible local educational agency to assist the agency in providing adequate educational services to the students served by the agency. Sets forth eligibility criteria, including considerations of overcrowding and the presence of a certain number or percentage of presumptive aliens. Defines presumptive alien, for both the hospital and educational agency parts of this Act, to mean a low-income individual who is not (or who the hospital or educational agency reasonably believes is not) a citizen or national of the United States, without regard to the immigration status of the individual."
