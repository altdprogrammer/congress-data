    "text": "Omnibus Nuclear Power Safety and Security Enhancement Act of 1989 - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue regulations requiring nuclear industry contractors to implement an identification and reporting mechanism regarding substantial safety hazards and defects. Establishes a civil penalty for noncompliance with such regulations. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to include within the scope of security-related safeguards information any generic studies, reports, and analyses containing information that would provide substantial assistance in compromising or negating a licensee's security measures to protect nuclear material or facilities or in targeting vital plant equipment. Establishes an Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste to: (1) advise the NRC on nuclear waste management and disposal; and (2) review license applications referred to it by the NRC. Requires that the Committee's report be made part of the application record. Permits the NRC to authorize employees of its licensees (and such licensees' contractors) to carry firearms and make warrantless arrests upon reasonable belief that a felony is being committed at facilities within the NRC enforcement purview. Establishes criminal penalties for the sabotage of production or utilization facilities under construction. Authorizes the NRC to conduct warrantless premise searches of specified licensees and applicants and to enter the premises of certain non-licensed persons pursuant to a judicially approved administrative search warrant."
