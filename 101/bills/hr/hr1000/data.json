    "text": "National Community Service Act of 1989 - Title I: Establishment and Administration of the National Community Service Corporation - Establishes the National Community Service Program. Allows any individual to volunteer for service with the Program if: (1) such individual is determined by the Corporation for National Community Service (the Corporation) to be fit for service; and (2) adequate funds are available for enrollment. Directs the Corporation to establish rules for selecting and accepting applicants as volunteers, up to the total number of positions authorized for each fiscal year. Sets the length of individual service at three to six years, with individual discretion allowed within such time limits. Allows a portion of specified financial assistance to be provided to a volunteer who is released after partial completion of service because of compelling personal circumstances. Requires Program volunteers to serve for: (1) two weekends a month and two weeks during the year; or (2) an average of nine hours per week. Provides for transfers of volunteers. Directs the Corporation annually to provide each Program participant a non-transferable voucher equal to $3,000 for each year of service. Requires that such voucher be used only for: (1) payment of a federally-sponsored student loan; (2) downpayment for a first home; or (3) payment for educational tuition, fees, room, and board, to be paid directly to an educational, technical, or vocational institution. Excludes such compensation from gross income for income tax purposes. Requires each volunteer to attend a six-week national training session conducted by the Corporation. Requires each State to provide any additional training a volunteer may receive on the community level. Requires that each volunteer receive additional training in relevant skills from the sponsoring government agency or organization. Directs the Corporation to coordinate and administer the Program. Title II: Establishment and Organization of the Corporation - Establishes the Corporation for National Community Service as a nonprofit organization which shall not be considered an agency or establishment of the U.S. Government. Title III: Provision of Community Services - Directs each State Governor to designate a State Administrator to administer and supervise the Program in that State. Sets forth provisions for State plans and State office duties. Directs each State Administrator, in selecting eligible organizations for placement of volunteers, to give preference to agencies and organizations that involve: (1) primarily existing programs; (2) nonprofit organizations (e.g. United Way); (3) government-sponsored volunteer programs (e.g. State conservation corps); and (4) programs that provide or develop services for young people (e.g. Big Brother/ Big Sister), the elderly (e.g. Meals on Wheels or nursing home visitors), public safety (e.g. volunteer firefighters or emergency medical personnel), conservation (e.g. parks and reforestation), and helping others help themselves (e.g. home care, literacy training, and Habitat for Humanity). Title IV: Miscellaneous - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1991 through 1994. Authorizes the following maximum numbers of volunteers: (1) 50,000 in FY 1991; (2) 100,000 in FY 1992l (3) 200,000 in FY 1993; and (4) 400,000 in FY 1994. Provides for Federal, State, local, and private shares of Program costs."
