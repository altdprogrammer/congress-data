    "text": "Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to apportion and distribute certain funds awarded to the Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada on a per capita basis among persons enrolled as members of certain tribes and their descendants who are members of the Western Shoshone Judgment Distribution Association (the distributees). Sets forth procedures to establish a judgment roll for apportioning the award. Directs the Secretary to pay such funds directly to the distributees or their beneficiaries. Directs the Secretary to retain the funds of persons who are on the judgment roll but who are not distributees in an invested account until the Congress determines the disposition of the remaining funds. Exempts such funds from Federal and State income tax. Prohibits discrimination by tribes and bands against distributees who participate in the distribution of such funds by denying such distributees the benefits and opportunities available to other persons not receiving a share of such funds. Prohibits the receipt of such funds as construing a waiver of existing treaty or State compact rights or as a sale of ancestral lands. Declares that such funds are compensation for past damages. Prohibits executive order reservations set aside for the Western Shoshone Indians from being diminished by this Act and confirms them effective with their respective dates."
