    "text": "State Energy Efficiency Programs Improvement Act of 1990 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to mandate that each State energy conservation plan which receives Federal assistance under the Act contain a specified improvement in energy efficiency as one of its goals. Adds to Federal assistance eligibility prerequisites for proposed State energy conservation plans. Requires a supplemental emergency planning program for energy supply disruptions. Requires State assurances that Federal financial assistance will be used to supplement and not supplant State and local funds. Permits a State to use available Federal financial assistance to develop and conduct the energy emergency planning program requirements. Cites optional State energy conservation programs. Repeals the mandate for supplemental State energy conservation plans. Revises requirements of State Energy Technology Commercialization Services programs to emphasize service to small or start-up businesses. Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) a State Energy Advisory Board to: (1) make recommendations regarding energy efficiency objectives; (2) encourage technology transfer of Federal research and development results with respect to energy efficiency and renewable energy resources; (3) serve as liaison between the States and DOE on energy programs; and (4) submit an annual status report to the Congress. Authorizes the use of loan programs and performance contracting for the non-Federal share of energy conservation project costs for schools and hospitals. Repeals the prohibition against the use of Federal grants for energy conservation measures in school administration buildings. Sets forth circumstances under which a State may use specified Federal funds for program and technical assistance and marketing costs associated with leveraging of non-Federal funds for energy conservation programs. Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to list the cooling measures that are eligible for Federal assistance under the Weatherization Assistance Program. Mandates that States participating in the low-income weatherization assistance program (WAP) ensure that: (1) weatherization assistance benefits accrue primarily to low-income tenants; and (2) such tenants are not subjected to rental increases unless they are demonstrably unrelated to weatherization measures. Requires the Secretary to update annually the data used for allocating weatherization assistance funds. Cites conditions under which the Secretary may approve a State application for a waiver of: (1) the requirement that at least 40 percent of Federal weatherization assistance for low-income persons be used for weatherization materials; and (2) the limitations placed upon expenditures per dwelling unit for weatherization measures. Terminates the Performance Fund used for State weatherization assistance. Conditions Federal low-income weatherization assistance upon the establishment of State plans and procedures for using such assistance to increase the portion of low-income weatherization assistance that the State obtains from non-Federal sources, including private sources. Sets forth additional requirements for the Secretary's annual weatherization assistance report to the Congress and the President. Outlines an incentives program under which the Secretary may allocate funds: (1) beginning in FY 1992 to provide supplementary financial assistance to those States with the best low-income weatherization assistance performance; and (2) beginning in FY 1991 among the States in equal portions so that they may make supplementary financial assistance to grant recipients with the best low-income weatherization assistance performance record. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993 for: (1) State energy conservation plans; and (2) energy conservation for schools and hospitals. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994 for the weatherization assistance program."
