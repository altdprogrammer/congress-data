    "text": "Title I: Federal Victim's Services and Protections Compliance Act - Federal Victim's Services and Protections Compliance Act - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish an evaluation system for law enforcement officers which rates such officers on their compliance with specified laws protecting victims of crimes; and (2) use such evaluation system to create standards governing services to victims and witnesses in Federal cases and to serve as a model to States and localities. Requires the Office for Victims of Crime to report periodically to the public, the Congress, and the President on victim protections and on compliance with this Act. Title II: The Federal Child Victim's Bill of Rights - Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to authorize a court to order that testimony of a child be taken in a room other than the courtroom and be televised by closed circuit equipment to be viewed by the court. Limits the parties who may be present during the child's testimony. Authorizes the court to: (1) require a party to be sequestered in an adjacent room or behind a screen or mirror that permits the party to see and hear the child during the child's testimony but does not allow the child to see or hear the party (requires the court, in such cases, to ensure that the party and counsel can confer during testimony and to provide an opportunity for cross examination); (2) order that the testimony of a child be taken by recorded deposition for use at trial; (3) admit into evidence the recorded statements of a child describing sexual conduct performed with or on the child, if specified conditions are met; and (4) permit the use of anatomical dolls, puppets, or toys which the court determines may aid the testimony of a child in describing such sexual conduct. Establishes procedures for: (1) determining the competency of a child to be a witness; and (2) protecting the identity of the child victim and the confidentiality of specified information. Prohibits the release of such information except as authorized by the court or to the accused or accused's counsel. Specifies that there is no statute of limitation within which a prosecution must be commenced for any sex offense involving a victim under 18 years of age. Directs or authorizes the court to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interests of the minor under specified circumstances. Grants a child under 18 years of age, while testifying at or attending a judicial proceeding, the right to be accompanied by a parent, victim/witness counselor, or other adult designated by the court. Specifies the role of such attendant. Provides for expedited procedures for the prosecution of any action involving a dangerous crime against children. Requires any physician, social worker, or specified other individuals (medical personnel, teachers, and anyone who has reasonable cause to believe that a child is abused or neglected) to report to the appropriate authorities. Makes: (1) reporters immune from liability under this Act; and (2) failure to report a class A misdemeanor. Title III: Child Care Worker Employee Background Check - Requires each Federal agency hiring individuals determined to have supervisory or disciplinary authority over children to require a report of the criminal history of specified employees."
