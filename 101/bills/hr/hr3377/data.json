Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of such requirements. Amends Federal law to require public notice of agency rules changes. Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to: (1) authorize inspectors general to subpoena witnesses; (2) authorize inspectors general to transmit a report directly to the appropriate congressional committee if the Secretary of an agency fails to do so; and (3) appoint inspectors general for ten-year terms. Establishes within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) a Comptroller to advise the Secretary on Department financial and management activities. Prohibits: (1) HUD fee arrangements tied to success in obtaining a grant or the amount of such grant; and (2) HUD officers or employees from disclosing inside information during the housing assistance selection process."
