Requires such program to emphasize on-the-job training and recruitment of the unemployed. Requires that an inventory of available programs be accessible. Requires the Director to appoint a National Advisory Council on Advanced Technician Training to review and report to the Director and to the Congress (directly, without review by NSF or the Office of Management and Budget) on the effectiveness of the program, with recommendations as needed. Requires the Director to designate ten centers of excellence among such colleges to serve as clearinghouses, half for advanced technician training and half for undergraduate education in mathematics and science. Requires the Director to make at least 20 grants annually. Requires that funds under this Act be used to strengthen programs in advanced-technology occupations, for faculty development in advanced-technology fields such as laser, robotic, and computer technology, and the development of cooperative training and information networks with other schools and the private sector. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992."
