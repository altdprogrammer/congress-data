    "text": "Access to Professional Sports Programming Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require persons who encrypt (hold the right to the programming or establish the price, terms, and conditions for the distribution of such programming) professional sports programming for satellite delivery to: (1) make such programming available to satellite antenna users for both private and public viewing; (2) establish nondiscriminatory financial, character, technical, and service requirements for distributors of such programming; and (3) establish price, terms, and conditions for the wholesale distribution of such programming which do not discriminate against users or among distributors (with specified exceptions for certain rate differentials). Authorizes persons aggrieved by violations of this Act to bring civil actions. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to investigate and report to the Congress on the availability of professional sports network programming and the degree to which payment for the programming will affect the availability of such programming without charge."
