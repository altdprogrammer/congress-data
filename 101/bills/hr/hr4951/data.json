Sets forth home dialysis payment amounts, but prohibits payment in excess of the Medicare payment which would otherwise have been made for such ambulance services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the costs and effectiveness of various home dialysis services available to end stage renal disease patients."
