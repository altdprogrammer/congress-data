    "text": "Aid for Development Act - Title I: Findings and Funding - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that not less than $200,000,000 be made available for FY 1990 for certain activities which can significantly reduce childhood mortality. Adds maternal malnutrition and morbidity reduction as a goal for such activities. Adds safe water programs to the list of activities. Provides that priority should be given to activities which strengthen the capacity and infrastructure of local communities to improve the health of children and women. Requires that not less than 50 percent of funds authorized each fiscal year for education and human resources development be available only for programs in basic primary and secondary education. Prohibits the provision of human rights and development assistance to the government of any country which engages in a consistent pattern of violations of: (1) the rights of civilians and noncombatants in armed conflict; or (2) internationally recognized child labor rights. Requires the Secretary of State to transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate an annual report regarding: (1) the status of the rights of civilians in armed conflict situations; and (2) the status of internationally recognized child labor rights. Adds civilians in situations of armed conflict as a matter pertaining to human rights and humanitarian affairs for which the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs is responsible. Increases to 18 percent from 13 1/2 percent the aggregate amount of specified appropriations required to be made available for activities of private and voluntary organizations for FY 1990 through 1992 (currently FY 1986 through 1989). Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 to authorize appropriations for the Inter-American Foundation. Amends the African Development Foundation Act to authorize appropriations for the African Development Foundation. Title II: Asian and Pacific Development Foundation - Asian and Pacific Development Foundation Act - Establishes the Asian and Pacific Development Foundation. Declares that the purposes of the Foundation shall be: (1) to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the people in Asia and the Pacific and the people of the United States; (2) to support self-help activities at the local level designed to enlarge opportunities for community development; (3) to encourage the establishment of development institutions which are indigenous to particular countries in Asia and the Pacific. Requires the Foundation to coordinate its development assistance activities with the activities of the U.S. Government and private, regional, and international organizations. Authorizes the Foundation to make grants, loans, and loan guarantees to certain indigenous private or public groups or associations in Asia or the Pacific. Sets priorities for making such grants, loans, and loan guarantees. Authorizes appropriations."
