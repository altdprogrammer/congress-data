    "text": "Revises property conveyance restrictions placed upon certain property transferred to the Peninsula Airport Commission, Virginia, to: (1) increase the total acreage for which the Secretary of Transportation may grant releases; and (2) repeal the prohibition on the Commission's conveyance of any property interest to persons other than the City of Newport News, Virginia. Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to authorize the State of Hawaii to use certain excess funds generated in off-airport locations in the State from the sale of duty-free merchandise for highway construction aimed at facilitating access to its airports. Authorizes such use for revenues generated on sales through December 31, 1994. Limits the amount of revenues permitted to be used in such manner during each year. Reduces such limit if the State increases a landing fee or other service charge by a percentage which is greater than the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for that year. Prohibits the State, if any such revenues are used in a calendar year for airport facility improvement purposes, from receiving Federal grants for airport development, planning, or noise compatability programs. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency to institute, for a one-year period beginning no later than December 30, 1990, a program for the operational evaluation of the collision avoidance system known as TCAS-II. Authorizes the Administrator to extend the deadline for installing collision avoidance equipment for not to exceed two years if necessary to promote a safe and orderly transition to operation of a fleet of civil aircraft equipped with TCAS-II or to promote other safety objectives. Authorizes another extension beyond such two-year period if the Administrator notifies the Senate and House Transportation Committees of such extension to promote aviation safety at least 90 days before it is to take effect. Directs the Administrator to consider the feasibility and desirability of amending the schedule for the installation of airborne low-altitude windshear equipment in order to make such schedule compatible with the schedule for the installation of TCAS-II. Extends by four months the period in which the Administrator is authorized to assess civil penalties for FAA safety and security violations under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958."
