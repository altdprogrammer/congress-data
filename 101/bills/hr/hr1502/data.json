Police) of the District of Columbia. Makes such funding available only for salaries and expenses of the D.C. Police in excess of the authorized level of 4,355 members of the department for FY 1989. Prohibits the use of such funds in FY 1990 until the Mayor develops and submits a community-oriented policing system plan to specified congressional committees. Prohibits the use of such funds after FY 1990 until the Mayor notifies such committees that a community-oriented policing system has been implemented in the District of Columbia. Requires the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration in the District of Columbia to report to the Congress on: (1) the resources available to D.C. courts; (2) the feasibility and cost of increasing D.C. court personnel; and (3) the need for changes in detention and sentencing guidelines and the social services program of the D.C. courts. Directs the Attorney General to report to the Congress on the potential effects of increased efforts to eliminate drug-related criminal activity in the District of Columbia on crime and law enforcement in the D.C. metropolitan area. Requires the District of Columbia to request the Director of the Bureau of Prisons and the Director of the National Institute of Corrections to provide it with technical assistance and training in the development of a criminal recordkeeping and classification system providing the basis for a uniform strategy for managing and evaluating the processing of D.C. criminals. Amends the District of Columbia Uniform Controlled Substances Act of 1981 to require that proceeds from the sale of forfeited property be used to finance law enforcement activities of the D.C. Police. Directs the D.C. Police to disseminate its unexpurgated adult arrest records to members of the court and law enforcement officers without cost and without the authorization of persons to whom such records relate. Authorizes appropriations for the implementation of a Police Corps program in West Virginia and the District of Columbia assisting up to 25 college or graduate students in each of such jurisdictions in paying for their education if they agree to serve for at least four years as law enforcement officers in West Virginia or the District of Columbia."
