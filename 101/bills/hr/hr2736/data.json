Restricts the diversion of water to the recharge system of the Unit based on the level of instream flows of the Platte River. Requires the Secretary, the State of Nebraska, and other Federal entities to enter into a cost-sharing agreement before funds are expended for construction of groundwater recharge components. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to pay annually an in-lieu tax payment to the counties and other political subdivisions that provide real property for the recharge facilities and the habitat component of the Unit."
