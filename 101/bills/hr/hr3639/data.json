    "text": "Surveying and Mapping Cooperative Opportunity Act of 1989 - Establishes within the National Mapping Division of the Geological Survey the Surveying and Mapping Cooperative Opportunity Program for FY 1991 through 1994. Mandates that such Program apply to all surveying and mapping activities of the Division associated with measuring, locating, and preparing graphical or digital presentations depicting natural or manmade physical features, phenomena, and legal boundaries of the earth. Directs the Division to: (1) utilize private, for-profit firms for work performed by contract; (2) increase its percent of such activities performed under contract with such firms annually by specified amounts; and (3) comply with the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act for selection of such firms and provisions of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988 affecting surveying and mapping services in order to assure a fair distribution of contracts to firms of all sizes. Requires the performance of such contracts to be under the supervision of appropriate persons in private firms. Requires all mapping by the U.S. Government at a scale larger than 1:24,000 to be performed by such firms. Requires the Division to contract with private firms for any work requested by, or for which reimbursement is provided by, other entities. Prohibits the Division from entering into any contract for the: (1) utilization of persons other than Survey employees for any surveying and mapping service which requires the use of or performance at Government facilities; and (2) performance of surveying and mapping services for the Division with any entity other than a private firm. Waives such requirement and prohibition for work performed by the Division for the Department of Defense if the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy that the use of contractors to perform such work would impair national security. Prohibits the Division from: (1) acquiring additional equipment, personnel, or facilities related to surveying and mapping activities except to the extent that they are necessary to carry out development on products and services that are not available from the private sector; and (2) conducting certain studies for such surveying and mapping activities. Directs the Division to make available to the public an inventory of such surveying and mapping activities annually. Directs the Division to submit a final report on such Program to the Congress within 90 days before the end of FY 1994."
