Requires the Administrator to make inspections, and conduct reviews of maintenance and other records, of passenger aircraft to determine the airworthiness of such aircraft. Requires inspections to be conducted as part of a heavy maintenance check, on or after the first day of the 15th year in which such aircraft is in service. Requires air carriers, at a minimum, to demonstrate to the Administrator that maintenance of the aircraft's structure, skin, and other age-sensitive components has been adequate to ensure the highest degree of safety. Directs the Administrator to establish certain aircraft maintenance safety programs, including one for the training of inspectors."
