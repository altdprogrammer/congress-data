Specifies that such programs may include treatment and education, street patrols, sealing up deserted buildings, organizing youth activities, and activities related to improving communication and information-sharing with police. Allows grants to be made to pay the salary of a full- or part-time employee to coordinate and direct the programs of the group. Requires a grant application to contain: (1) a description of the program to be funded and how it would benefit the community; and (2) information relating to how the group would benefit from the hiring of an employee. Requires: (1) each group receiving a grant to submit semiannual reports to the President describing the status and activities of the program being funded; and (2) the President to submit semiannual reports to the Congress describing the programs being funded and their impact on illegal drug traffic and use. Authorizes appropriations."
