Authorizes the Secretary to acquire fee title to lands which, as of August 1, 1990, were owned by Upper Peninsula Energy Corporation without regard to any acreage limitation set forth in this Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study certain rivers for possible designations as wild and scenic rivers and to establish for each such river a River Study Committee to advise him in the preparation of a study report to the Congress. Terminates each such Committee after submission of its report. Permits the installation and operation of facilities or other activities within or outside the boundaries of such designated river segments for the control of the lamprey eel, subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe for the protection of water quality and other values (including wild and scenic characteristics) of the river. Authorizes appropriations."
