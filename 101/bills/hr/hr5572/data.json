    "text": "IRCA Anti-Discrimination Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend General Accounting Office employer sanction reporting requirements. Includes certain seasonal agricultural workers within the scope of such anti-discrimination employment provisions. Requires public dissemination of information about anti-discrimination protections under such Act and under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Repeals the requirement that an alien must file a declaration of intention to become a citizen in order to be covered by such anti-discrimination provisions. Repeals the provision awarding attorney's fees only if the losing party's argument is without reasonable legal and factual foundation. Revises and increases employer civil money penalties. Establishes criminal penalties for pattern or practice violations. Permits a person who was discriminated against by an employer while merely testing such employer's employment practices to file a complaint. Treats certain employer documentary practices as employment practices for purposes of such Act."
