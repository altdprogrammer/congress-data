    "text": "Coastal Wetlands Recovery Act - Directs the Secretary of the Army to identify and designate threatened coastal wetlands for which a wetlands action plan must be developed. Grants priority to those wetlands determined to be most threatened. Requires each such plan to specify wetlands boundaries, causes of degradation, and a timetable for actions which need to be taken, as well as allocating financial responsibility for such activities. Authorizes the use of water control structures and the appropriate diversion or deposition of natural elements. Sets forth State participation and financial responsibilities under this Act, requiring the contribution of at least 25 percent of costs from non-Federal sources. Requires wetlands plans to be periodically reviewed and updated. Grants the Secretary emergency authority to take necessary actions at priority wetlands during FY 1987 and 1988. Authorizes appropriations."
