Prohibits REA guarantees of loans from any Federal lending agency after such date. Revises guaranteed loan and direct or insured loan prepayment provisions. Reduces the maximum amount of funds that a borrower may invest. Prohibits the REA from guaranteeing loans after such date to certain metropolitan area borrowers for: (1) recreation purposes; or (2) telephone service improvement if the borrower's gross revenues exceed specified amounts. Repeals the provision creating a telephone bank reserve for losses due to interest rate changes. Requires the telephone bank to retire all Treasury-held debentures by September 30, 1995. Prohibits the further issuance of such debentures. Provides for the privatization of the telephone bank."
