Increases authorized appropriations. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the Director) to publish in the Federal Register advisory standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories in conducting DNA analyses. Specifies that such standards shall: (1) state criteria to be applied to each procedure used by forensic laboratories to conduct DNA analyses; and (2) be revised periodically by the Director. Authorizes the Director to approve a DNA proficiency testing program offered by a private nonprofit organization if: (1) such program satisfies the then current published standards; and (2) such organization agrees to issue to each forensic laboratory that participates in such program a document certifying that such laboratory participated in such program and specifying the period during which such organization tested the proficiency of such laboratory to conduct DNA analyses. Requires the Director to withdraw approval of a DNA proficiency testing program if such program or organization ceases to satisfy the requirements specified in this Act."
