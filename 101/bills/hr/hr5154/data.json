    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-06-26", 
    "text": "Military Personnel Readjustment Assistance Act of 1990 - Title I: Military Personnel Readjustment Benefits - Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish within the Office of the Secretary of Defense a Military Personnel Readjustment Office to develop and coordinate Department of Defense (DOD) programs designed to assist military personnel and their dependents in readjusting to civilian life after discharge or release from active duty. Provides separation pay for a regular enlisted member of the armed forces who is discharged involuntarily or as the result of the denial of reenlistment if such member has completed at least six but less than 20 years of active service, unless the Secretary determines that the conditions of discharge do not warrant such pay. Repeals the limitation on the amount of separation pay for any individual. Makes the payment of such separation pay inapplicable to a member of the armed forces who is serving on active duty as of September 30, 1990, is discharged or released, and who has at least five but less than six years of active service. Entitles a member of the armed forces who is involuntarily separated from active duty during the five-year period beginning October 1, 1990, to medical and dental care and other health benefits provided while on active-duty service for a transitional period of 60 days for those separated with less than six years of active service, and 120 days for those with six or more years of active service. Directs the Secretary to inform each member involuntarily separated after October 1, 1990, of the availability for purchase of a conversion health policy for members and their dependents to pay the costs of health care for one year. Urges the Secretary of the military department concerned to consider, on an individual basis in cases of hardship, the provision of health care at a military facility for members separated during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 1990, and who are ineligible for transitional health care or who do not obtain a conversion health policy. Requires the Secretary concerned to give special consideration to requests for such care when the condition for which treatment is required was incurred or aggravated before separation. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to allow a member of the armed forces involuntarily separated during such five-year period to continue to use commissary and exchange stores for one year. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to permit individuals involuntarily separated during such period to continue for up to 180 days after such separation to reside with their dependents in military family housing provided or leased by DOD during their active service. Directs the Secretary concerned to require a reasonable rental for such use. Includes as part of preseparation counseling available to members of the armed forces: (1) information concerning government and private-sector programs for job search and job placement assistance; (2) job placement counseling for a member's spouse; (3) information concerning the availability of medical coverage following separation from active duty; (4) information concerning the availability of relocation assistance services; (5) counseling on the effects of career changes on individuals and their families; and (6) financial planning assistance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a program to promote and publicize job fairs which may be of interest to members of the armed forces and their dependents; (2) establish a program to provide to members discharged or released from active duty a certification or verification of any skills and experience acquired while on active duty that may have application to employment in the private sector; (3) provide that members of the armed forces who are involuntarily separated (and their dependents) are awarded a preference in hiring by nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of DOD; and (4) develop and carry out at not less than ten military installations outside the United States a program to assist members who are preparing for discharge or release from active duty (and their dependents) in readjusting to civilian life. Amends the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 to provide that a member of the armed forces involuntarily separated during the five-year period who has a dependent enrolled in a school of the defense dependents' education system shall continue to be eligible to enroll such dependent in such school until the earliest of the completion of the dependent's secondary education, the end of the two year period following such separation, or, in the case of dependents not enrolled at the time of separation, the completion of the period of enrollment during which the member is involuntarily separated. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense committees on the implementation of provisions of this title. Repeals Federal law concerning the starting period and the aggregate amount of unemployment compensation to be paid to individuals released or discharged from Federal service. Title II: Defense Officer Personnel Management Policies - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to allow the Secretary of the military department concerned, during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 1990, to: (1) shorten the period of the continuation of active duty for a regular officer who is serving on active duty pursuant to a selection for continuation on such duty; (2) provide that regular officers on the active-duty list may be considered for early retirement by a selection board for specified officers in the regular grade; (3) suspend current Federal law stating that so long as an officer below brigadier general or rear admiral holds the same grade, he may not be considered for early retirement more than once in any five-year period; and (4) convene selection boards to consider for discharge regular officers on the active-duty list in grades below lieutenant colonel or commander who have at least one year in such grade, whose names are not on a recommended-for-promotion list, and who are not eligible to be retired and are not within two years of becoming eligible. Limits the total number of officers who may be recommended during a fiscal year for discharge by such a selection board. Authorizes the Secretary to allow the Secretary of the military department concerned to reduce the time-in-grade requirement before voluntary retirement is permitted to two years in the case of retirements effective during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 1990. Authorizes the Secretary to allow the Secretary concerned, during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 1990, to reduce the required length of commissioned service before voluntary retirement is permitted from ten years to eight years."
