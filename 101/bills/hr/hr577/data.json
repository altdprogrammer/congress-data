Deletes the provision contained in the law providing for an early warning system in Sinai that permits the Congress to require the removal of U.S. civilian personnel assigned to Sinai if the Congress by concurrent resolution determines that the safety of such personnel is jeopardized or that continuation of their role is no longer necessary. Amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to repeal the authority of the Congress to terminate a declaration of a national emergency by concurrent resolution. Amends the Neutrality Act of 1939 to repeal the provision that authorizes the Congress by concurrent resolution to declare that a state of war exists between foreign states. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to delete certain provisions that give the Congress the authority to limit certain international aid programs, including nuclear transfers, by adopting a concurrent resolution. Deletes the provision prohibiting the use of foreign aid funds to train the police forces of foreign countries. Changes certain provisions relating to the Department of Defense that give the Congress the authority to limit actions of the Department of Defense by adopting a resolution or a concurrent resolution or by requiring the Department of Defense to notify the Congress before taking action (including provisions dealing with the ordering to duty of selected reserves, emergency construction projects, contributions for NATO infrastructure, Naval Petroleum Reserves, and a long-range proving ground for guided missiles). Amends certain Acts dealing with armed forces personnel and veterans' health care to limit the authority of the Congress to oversee programs contained in such Act. Amends the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to delete the provision authorizing the Congress to nullify a proposed rule or order by passage of a resolution. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to delete certain provisions that give the Congress the authority to oversee actions, programs, or agreements under such Acts."
