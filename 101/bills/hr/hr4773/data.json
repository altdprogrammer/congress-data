Prohibits the Commission from accepting any gifts of money from any source. Mandates that fees or charges collected under this Act be used solely to pay for Conference participants' meals and to defray the expense of meeting rooms. Requires the Commission to maintain a receipts and disbursements record according to specified guidelines. Establishes the White House Conference on Small Business Commission, which shall be responsible for the National Conference and for its final report to the President and the Congress. Requires the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy to provide planning and administrative assistance for the Conference. Directs the Administrator to prescribe financial controls and accounting procedures for fees and charges received by the Commission and for Commission payment of authorized meal and meeting room expenses. Directs the Commission to establish procedures whereby a Conference delegate may petition for reimbursement of Conference expenses that would constitute a financial burden. Restricts such reimbursement to: (1) transportation, meals and lodging; and (2) the rates provided Federal employees who travel to Washington, D.C. on official business. Directs the Commission to: (1) provide to the Small Business Administration a separate accounting for such reimbursed expenses (and a final financial report and all financial records); and (2) deposit in the Treasury any unexpended monies which were collected as fees and charges. Requires the Small Business Administration to report annually to the Congress for the next three years on the status and implementation of Conference recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
