Provides that surety bonds required for direct Federal procurement of response action contracts under the Miller Act shall be issued in accordance with such Act. Provides that, if under any Federal law surety bonds are required for direct Federal procurement of response action contracts: (1) no right of action shall accrue on the performance bond issued on such contract to or for the use of any person other than the obligee named in the bond; and (2) in the event of a default, the surety's liability on a bond shall be only for the cost of completion of the contract work in accordance with the plans less the balance of funds remaining to be paid under the contract, up to the penal sum of the bond."
