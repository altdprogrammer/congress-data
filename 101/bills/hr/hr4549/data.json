Requires the Administrator to conduct a national competition in which he or she shall award grants to participants for research and development of design for a magnetic levitation transportation system. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Administrator to award one grant for the construction of a magnetic levitation transportation system at least 40 miles long. Requires the Administrator to study the feasibility of and need for adopting a standard for the construction of guidelines for magnetic levitation transportation systems which would allow for future development of an interconnecting network of such systems."
