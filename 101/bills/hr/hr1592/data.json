Amends the National Bank Act to allow national banks to acquire the shares of a thrift institution that has an amount of regulatory capital equal to less than three percent of the total liabilities of such institution. Prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from imposing on a bank holding company which purchases shares in such a thrift institution any limitations relating to the extent such bank holding company may: (1) increase the number of branches of any insured institution subsidiary; (2) allow insured institution subsidiaries to offer or market the products or services of bank subsidiaries; (3) consolidate certain functions; (4) allow the use of the same name or logo by bank and insured institution subsidiaries; or (5) allow transactions between insured institution subsidiaries and other affiliates of such insured institutions. Amends the National Housing Act to allow certain savings and loan holding companies to acquire not more than five percent of the voting shares of a thrift institution which is not a subsidiary of such holding company. Allows mutual savings and loan holding companies to sell to the public not more than 49 percent of the shares of any insured institution subsidiary of such holding company."
