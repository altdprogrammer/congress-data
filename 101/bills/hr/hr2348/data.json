Increases the delayed retirement credit rate for individuals who work beyond retirement age. Eliminates the recomputation of an individual's primary insurance amount when such individual has wages or self-employment income after entitlement to old-age or disability insurance benefits. Charges off an individual's excess earnings by eliminating such individual's entitlement to retroactive OASDI benefits for months preceding such individual's attainment of retirement age. Authorizes the appropriation of revenues received by reason of this Act's amendments to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund from 1990 through 1994."
