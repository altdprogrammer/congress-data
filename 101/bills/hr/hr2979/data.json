    "date": "1989-07-24", 
    "text": "Warrant Officer Management Act of 1989 - Title I: Amendments to Subtitle A of Title 10, United States Code - General Military Law - Part A: Permanent Grade of Chief Warrant Officer, W-5 - Authorizes appointment of chief warrant officers (CWO) at the grade of W-5. Prohibits an appointment if it would result in more than five percent of the warrant officers of that armed force on active duty being in a grade above CWO, W-4. Part B: Retirement of Warrant Officers for Length of Service - Sets forth requirements for retirement of regular Army warrant officers at grades W-5 (after 30 years' service) and W-4 (after 24 years' service). Part C: Promotion - Directs the Secretary concerned to convene selection boards as necessary (removing from existing law the at least once per year requirement) to recommend for promotion warrant officers from W-2 through W-4. Directs that W-1 officers be promoted in accordance with prescribed regulations. Alters the composition of selection boards to allow appointment of senior warrant officers as additional members. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to convene selection boards to recommend permanent warrant officers for continuation of active duty and for retirement. Allows inclusion of reserve officers on boards considering promotion of reserve warrant officers. Requires the Secretary concerned, before convening a selection board, to establish: (1) a single list of warrant officers on active duty for each armed force under his jurisdiction; (2) competitive categories for promotion of warrant officers on the warrant officer active-duty list; (3) a promotion zone for warrant officers on such list serving in each grade and competitive category to be considered by the board; and (4) the maximum number of warrant officers to be recommended for promotion from those serving in any grade or competitive category who are eligible for promotion. Establishes criteria for determining a warrant officer's position on the active-duty list and for recommending best-qualified warrant officers for promotion. Exempts certain reserve, retired, student, and Coast Guard warrant officers from coverage under this Act. Sets forth procedures for consideration of selective retirement of regular warrant officers, deeming such retirement to be involuntary for purposes of any other provision of law. Revises provisions relating to effective dates of promotions and the effect of a second failure of promotion. Title II: Amendments to Title 37, United States Code, Pay and Allowances for Chief Warrant Officer, W-5 - Authorizes pay and allowances for CWOs at the grade of W-5. Title III: Effective Dates - Sets forth the effective dates of this Act. Title IV: Transition Provisions - Regular Warrant Officers Serving in a Higher Temporary Grade Below Chief Warrant Officer, W-5 - Establishes interim provisions for the promotion of regular and reserve warrant officers serving in a higher temporary grade. Allows any Army warrant officer who on the effective date of this Act holds a regular grade of CWO or is on a list of officers recommended for promotion to such grade to be retained on active duty until completing 30 years of active service or 24 years of active warrant officer service, whichever is later, and then be retired. Continues temporary appointments of Navy and Marine Corps warrant officers. Title V: Technical and Conforming Amendments - Makes technical and conforming amendments."
