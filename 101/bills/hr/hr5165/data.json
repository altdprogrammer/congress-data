    "text": "Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1989 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to grant a public agency which controls a commercial service airport authority to assess a fee for enplaning passengers at such airport to finance airport-related projects. Sets forth requirements with respect to the use and imposition of such fee. Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to reduce by a specified percentage airport improvement program apportionments for large and medium hub airports that impose a passenger facility charge. Earmarks a specified percentage of funds saved by such reduction for: (1) a specified discretionary fund; and (2) the establishment of a small airport fund to be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary. Redefines \"eligible point\" for the small community air service program. Prohibits determination that a point is not eligible on the basis of the per passenger subsidy at the point or on any other unspecified basis. Provides funding for the program."
