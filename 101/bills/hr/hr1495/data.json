Permits the use of appropriations for expenses of travel of Agency personnel outside the United States that continues beyond the end of a fiscal year. Directs the Agency Director to study and report to the Congress on steps which could be taken to improve prospects for conversion of portions of U.S. defense industries to nondefense-related activities as opportunities are presented through the achievement of arms control agreements. Title II: On-Site Inspection Activities - Declares that: (1) the Secretary of Defense should provide to the On-Site Inspection Agency policy guidance formulated through an interagency mechanism established by the President; and (2) the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency should provide to the interagency mechanism appropriate recommendations for such guidance.
