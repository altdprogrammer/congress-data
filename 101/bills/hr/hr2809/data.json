Conditions the conveyance of such lands and interests on requirements that: (1) the State of California agrees to provide to the United States a cash payment, monetary grants, or lands the Secretary finds are suitable for addition to, or are contiguous to, the National Forest System; (2) no harvest of timber and no mining, mineral leasing, or geothermal exploration or development shall be permitted on such lands; (3) any action by the State to convey any portions of such lands or interests to any entity other than the United States, or to permit use of such lands for any purpose that is prohibited or incompatible with the continued ability of such lands to support ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or giant sequoia trees, shall result in reversion of such lands to the United States; (4) the Secretary shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to collect seed from trees located on such lands for scientific or silvicultural purposes and, upon prior notification to such State, shall be entitled at any time to enter such lands to monitor the management of such lands and the compliance of such State with this Act; and (5) the conveyance shall be subject to certain reservations and exceptions. Requires the Attorney General, upon the request of the Secretary, to bring any action or take any other steps necessary to enforce such conditions of conveyance. Provides for the termination of National Forest designation of lands conveyed to California, the incorporation of other lands not conveyed into the Stanislaus National Forest, and the designation of lands conveyed to the United States as national forest lands."
