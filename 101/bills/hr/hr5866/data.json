    "text": "Airport System Planning Act of 1990 - Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to prohibit project grant applications from proposing airport development or airport planning except in connection with public-use airports included in an Airport Capital Improvement Plan prepared pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the approval of such an application unless the Secretary of Transportation is satisfied, among other things, that the project is reasonably consistent with airport and aviation system plans (existing at the time of the projects approval) of the State and the regional transportation planning authorities of the area in which the airport is located. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish performance measures for evaluating both individual airport improvement projects and the needs of the Nation's system of airports in conducting planning activities. Requires the Secretary, every four years, to conduct a national forum of Federal, State, and local officials and private sector representatives to identify and evaluate long-range problems associated with public-use airports. Directs the Secretary to transmit to the Congress and the President a strategic plan for airports. Requires the Secretary to transmit annually to the Congress and the President an Airport Capital Improvement Plan that includes: (1) a list of airport improvement projects which may receive Federal funding in the next five years; and (2) an evaluation and specific proposals to eliminate or reduce constraints on the development of such projects. Requires, upon a State's request, Federal cooperation and participation in the airport system planning of that State. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish guidelines for forecasting aviation activity at public-use airports within each State; and (2) develop a model State statute for airport vicinity land use planning. Directs the Secretary to conduct research and establish a methodology for determining the relationship between airport system capacity enhancement alternatives and the overall performance of the national economy, including the impact of such alternatives on private sector production of goods and services and on U.S. international competitiveness."
