    "text": "Federal Triangle Development Act Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Federal Triangle Development Act to exempt from any State and local sales taxation any materials, supplies, equipment, and goods connected with the development of the Federal Triangle property. Declares that no transfer or lease made pursuant to this Act, no instrument executed in connection with financing development of such property, and no lease or sublease of space by the International Cultural and Trade Center Commission to any nonprofit entity established for the exclusive purpose of operating, maintaining, and managing the international cultural and trade center shall be subject to State or local real or personal property tax, recordation tax, transfer tax, or special assessment. Grants the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation authority to obtain financing for the development of the Federal Triangle property from appropriate persons (including Federal agencies and instrumentalities). Provides for the Board of Directors of the Corporation to pay a maximum of three Corporation officers or employees Senior Executive Service pay rates. Adds the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to the International Cultural and Trade Center Commission. Provides that a Commissioner's term of office, after initial appointment, shall be six years. Prohibits the Commission staff from being composed of more than 15 individuals after the center's occupancy date (thus permitting a larger staff up to such date). States that, on or before the center's occupancy date, Federal personnel shall be detailed and office space, supplies, equipment, and support services shall be provided on a nonreimbursable basis. Authorizes the Commission to enter into contracts, leases, and agreements under such Act notwithstanding other provisions of law relating to acquisition, disposal, and use of property. Removes the annual limitation on the Commission's expenses for overhead costs for the period before occupancy of the center. Excludes certain operation and maintenance expenses from overhead expenses of the center. Authorizes appropriations for the Commission and the center for FY 1991. Provides for reimbursement of the Commission by a Federal agency for any program the agency requests. Requires the Commission to prepare a business plan for operating the center that contains the amount of space necessary for such operation before entering into an agreement with the General Services Administration (GSA)to lease space in the center. Requires the Commission to submit such plan to specified congressional committees and GSA. Requires GSA to approve the plan if it assures that the Commission will fulfill its responsibilities under the lease. Provides for annual payment to the GSA for various costs related to lease of space for the center. Authorizes nonprofit entities that manage the international cultural and trade center to purchase supplies directly from GSA under the conditions and terms applicable to Federal agencies. Defines \"occupancy date\" as the date on which the building and the center are substantially completed and available for public use and occupancy."
