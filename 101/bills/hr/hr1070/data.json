Requires such Plan to address coastal wetland loss, including the sediment starvation of such wetlands an and analysis of: (1) the need for river water diversion, increased flow, or navigation locks or channels; (2) the feasibility of repairing such lands; and (3) the role of government programs in developing and implementing such Plan. Limits the Federal share of costs to 75 percent except where the Plan benefits a Federal wildlife refuge or lands, in which case the Federal share shall be 100 percent. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1992."
