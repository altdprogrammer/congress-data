    "text": "Chinese Temporary Protected Status Act of 1989 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a temporary protected status for certain nationals of the People's Republic of China and other designated foreign states. Authorizes an alien under such status to work in the United States. Authorizes the Attorney General to so designate a country (or part thereof) only if: (1) there is an ongoing armed conflict which would threaten the safety of returned aliens; (2) a natural disaster has created conditions under which the country cannot handle the return of such aliens, and the country has requested such designation; or (3) extraordinary and temporary conditions exist in the country that prevent the aliens' return, unless the Attorney General finds that their presence in the United States would be contrary to U.S. national interest. Makes initial foreign state designations effective for between six and 18 months, as determined by the Attorney General. Designates the People's Republic of China such a country (based on extraordinary and temporary conditions). Makes such initial designation effective for three years from the date of enactment of this Act. Requires the Attorney General to review the status of a designated country at least annually. Makes a designation, extension, or termination of designation of a foreign country effective upon publication in the Federal Register. Prohibits judicial review of such designations. States that a Chinese national shall be eligible for such status only if he or she: (1) has been continuously physically present in the United States since the date of enactment of this Act; (2) has continuously resided in the United States since July 1, 1989; (3) is otherwise admissible as an immigrant; and (4) registers as required. States that an alien from a designated country shall be eligible for such status only if the alien: (1) has been continuously present and resided in the United States since the most recent designation of his or her country; (2) is otherwise admissible as an immigrant; and (3) registers as required. Authorizes registration fees, with a maximum amount of $50. Permits waiver of certain alien excludability provisions for humanitarian or family unity purposes or when otherwise in the public interest. Prohibits such waiver in cases involving certain drug offenses, criminals, national security concerns, or Nazi persecutions. Makes an alien ineligible for such benefits if he or she: (1) has been convicted in the United States of a felony or two or more misdemeanors; or (2) has participated in persecution or is a threat to U.S. security. States that such temporary residency period shall not be considered as physical presence for suspension of deportation purposes unless the Attorney General determines that extreme hardship exists. States that during such temporary residency period the alien: (1) shall not be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law; (2) shall not be eligible for Federal public assistance, except for specified emergency medical treatment; (3) may be deemed ineligible for public assistance by a State or local authority; (4) may travel abroad; and (5) shall be considered in lawful status for adjustment or change of status purposes. States that the statutory procedure established by this Act shall be the Attorney General's exclusive authority to permit specified aliens to remain in the United States temporarily by virtue of their nationality. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the operation of such temporary residency program."
