    "text": "Youth Crime Gang Control Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal criminal code to modify the factors to be considered by the court in determining whether a juvenile should be tried in Federal district court as an adult to include consideration of previous firearms offenses and to exclude evidence of the availability of programs designed to treat the juvenile's behavioral problems. Authorizes the transfer for trial in Federal district court of a former juvenile as an adult where the court finds that such transfer is in the interest of justice, considering the juvenile's age at the time of indictment and the reason for the delay in the filing of the indictment. Specifies that the rules of the State or place in which the Federal court sits governing records and information about juvenile delinquency proceedings shall govern with respect to permitted or required disclosure in a Federal juvenile delinquency proceeding."
