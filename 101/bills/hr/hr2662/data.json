Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress any notices provided by contractors regarding specific violations or non-compliance before their actual occurrence. Directs the Secretary, upon contractor request, to renegotiate the terms of compensation under covered contracts. Directs the Secretary to establish a payments incentive system to encourage contractors to discover and avoid violations that might occur in the course of contract performance. Sets a deadline by which the Secretary must issue regulations implementing this Act."
