    "text": "Medicaid Child Health Amendments of 1989 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to cover children born after September 30, 1983, whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Authorizes States to continue such coverage for one year after the family's income rises above the Federal poverty level. Requires States to receive the Medicaid applications of pregnant women, infants, and children at locations which include locations other than those used under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Act. Permits States to provide Medicaid coverage to all children whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Allows States to offer an additional nine-, 12-, 15-, or 18-month period of Medicaid eligibility, rather than the additional six-month period, to families who lose AFDC eligibility because of increased earnings or employment hours, or a loss of earning exclusions and receive the initial six months of extended Medicaid coverage. Requires that States submit information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by April 1 of each year, pertaining to the supply of and demand for pediatric services and proposed Medicaid payment rates for such services so that the Secretary may determine whether such rates are sufficient to ensure that pediatric services will be at least as available to Medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population. Requires States to immediately revise rates determined to be insufficient. Increases, by 25 percent, the Federal share of Medicaid costs attributable to State demonstration projects to reduce childhood mortality and morbidity by improving the access of Medicaid-eligible children to pediatricians. Limits FY 1990 expenditures for such projects. Directs States to adjust Medicaid payments to disproportionate share hospitals to take into account exceptionally costly and lengthy inpatient hospital services for children under 18 years of age."
