Directs the Administrator to revise the National Contingency Plan under such Act to require owners and operators of vessels or facilities to: (1) provide equipment that is adequate to minimize damage, and suitable for responding effectively to, discharges of oil or hazardous substances; (2) provide such equipment in an amount appropriate for the unique features of the environment; (3) have such equipment inspected for certification by the Coast Guard at least every three years; (4) provide response teams for Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, California, the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, the northeast, mid-, and south Atlantic coasts, and inland waters; (5) ensure that such teams are properly and immediately in use upon receiving notice of any discharge and are engaged in containment and removal activities no later than five hours after receiving such notice; and (6) subject such teams to federally approved training, review, and approval by the agency responsible for administering such team, and periodic drills without prior notice. Authorizes the Administrator to permit owners and operators to engage in cooperative efforts to comply with the Plan. Requires all activities under the Plan to be funded by persons engaged in interstate commerce in the production or transportation of oil or any hazardous substance. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to charge a fee for certification inspections. Requires owners and operators to meet the requirements of the revised Plan no later than December 31, 1990. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Makes chief executive officers of owners or operators jointly and severally liable for: (1) any fines assessed against such owners or operators; and (2) all costs incurred by the United States for the removal of oil or hazardous substances pursuant to this Act."
