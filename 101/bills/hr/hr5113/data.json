Replaces provisions requiring a study concerning childhood injuries with provisions directing the Secretary, through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, to submit to specified committees of the Congress a report describing the activities conducted or supported under provisions relating to injury control. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such injury control provisions. Eliminates provisions limiting the percentage of appropriated funds which may be used for Federal administrative expenses."
