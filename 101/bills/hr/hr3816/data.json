Directs the President to establish, and report to the Congress on, a nationwide monitoring program to compile data on acid deposition emissions, surface water quality, forest conditions, and visibility impairment. Provides for annual updates of monitoring results. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the President to develop an assessment framework for reporting complicated technical information about acid deposition in a manner useful to policymakers and the public to assist in formulating a response. Directs the President to: (1) submit updated assessments to the Congress every five years; and (2) report to the Congress on the reduction in acid deposition rates that must be achieved to prevent adverse ecological effects. Authorizes appropriations."
