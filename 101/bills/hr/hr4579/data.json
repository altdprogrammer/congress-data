    "text": "Environmental Vigilance Act - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate and periodically revise a list of environmental areas of concern. Requires areas to be included on such list if the environmental integrity of the area is: (1) indicative of the general state of environmental health; (2) important to the health of the local human populations; or (3) important to the production of food or other renewable goods. Lists areas to be included. Directs the Administrator, with respect to each area of concern, to determine whether the area is adequately monitored for chemical substances or other factors that may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Requires persons who manufacture or distribute chemical substances in areas with inadequate monitoring to monitor such areas if: (1) the substances have been detected in the areas; (2) the substances could have originated from their activities; and (3) the substances pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."
