Requires the Board to establish licensing standards for new or substantially modified DOE defense nuclear facilities. Prohibits such facilities from commencing operations without such a license. Grants the Board investigatory and oversight powers over the transportation of nuclear materials between facilities. Requires the Board to maintain an onsite staff for investigation, review, and compliance at each DOE defense nuclear facility. Requires the Secretary of Energy to notify the Board and the Congress immediately of any abnormal occurrence at a DOE defense nuclear facility that may result in an unplanned release of radioactive or hazardous materials. Authorizes the Board to issue administrative orders and bring suit in Federal court to compel compliance with its standards (including compliance with State and Federal standards). Authorizes the President, in the interests of national security, to issue the orders the overriding either court orders or administrative orders of the Board. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations under this Act."
