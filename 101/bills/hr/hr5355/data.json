Prohibits the House of Representatives or the Senate from considering legislation that: (1) would provide for a net increase (beyond a certain amount) in Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance benefits without providing at least a net increase in OASDI taxes; or (2) would provide for a net decrease (beyond a certain amount) in OASDI taxes without providing for at least a net decrease in OASDI benefits. Amends the Social Security Act to require the Board of Trustees of the OASDI trust funds to include in its annual report a finding as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are in close actuarial balance."
