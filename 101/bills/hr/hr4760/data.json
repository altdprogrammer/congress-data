    "text": "Budget Process Reform and Social Security Protection Act of 1990 - Title I: Budgetary Treatment of Social Security and Certain Other Trust Funds - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to exclude the social security trust funds from deficit calculations. Excludes receipts of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund from calculations of the unachieved deficit reduction. Amends the Social Security Act to make it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or resolution which would: (1) increase Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits without increasing OASDI taxes; or (2) decrease OASDI revenues without decreasing OASDI benefits. Requires the annual report of the Board of Trustees of the Trust Funds to include a finding as to whether the trust funds are in close actuarial balance. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish points of order for the House and the Senate in the consideration of legislation which would provide for an increase in outlays under any trust fund which would: (1) cause an imbalance in such trust fund during the next five fiscal years; or (2) provide for a net decrease in taxes without providing for at least a net decrease in outlays. Title II: Sequestration - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to provide permanent sequestration authority. Provides for the sequestration formula to include revenue increases until the budget is balanced. Revises the method of calculating the budget baseline. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax surcharge on the income of every taxpayer (to reduce the Federal deficit) when there is a required revenue increase for any fiscal year. Provides for applying sequestration to full-year appropriation bills enacted after a presidential final order. Title III: Tightened Scoring Rules and Multiyear Deficit Reduction - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the concurrent resolution on the budget to consist of planning levels for the four ensuing fiscal years (currently, two ensuing fiscal years). Makes conforming adjustments to provide five fiscal year coverage in multiyear deficit reductions, committee allocations, the President's budget, and the Congressional Budget Office analysis of prior legislation and the President's budget. Terminates deficit reduction requirements when an estimate of the start-of-year baseline deficit is less than one percent of the estimated gross national product for a fiscal year. Title IV: Public Debt Limit - Establishes the public debt limit for FY 1991 through 1995 or any subsequent fiscal year. Reduces such limit by any estimated net decrease in social security expenditures. Amends rule XLIX of the Rules of the House of Representatives and the Standing Rules of the Senate to make conforming changes. Title V: Pay As You Go - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to prohibit the House or Senate from enacting legislation that would result in an increased deficit of a specified amount. Title VI: Miscellaneous Reforms - Makes inapplicable certain provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, and repeals certain Senate resolutions, which govern extraneous provisions in the Senate. Amends rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate to make germaneness applicable to appropriation measures. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise legislative procedure regarding reconciliation. Title VII: Establishment of the Social Security Administration as an Independent Agency - Establishes the Social Security Administration as an independent agency, charged with administration of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program and supplemental security income program. Establishes a Social Security Board as head of the Administration and an Executive Director as the chief operating officer. Title VIII: Improvements in Social Security Services - Amends the Social Security Act to set forth standards governing the collection of overpayments. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out demonstration projects designed to implement accountability procedures in telephone service centers. Directs the Secretary to establish a program under which homeless individuals who may be eligible for insurance benefits may be provided reasonable assistance and support in applying for such benefits. Requires notices to individuals to be written in clear and simple language and include information on how to contact a responsible person regarding such notice. Provides that failure to request review of an adverse determination of entitlement to benefits shall not serve as a basis for denial of a subsequent application if the applicant failed to make such a request acting in good faith reliance on incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information provided by the Social Security Administration. Title IX: Representative Payee Reforms - Revises the process for selecting and recruiting representative payees and provides for compensating qualified payees. Requires the Secretary to conduct, and report to the Congress on, demonstration projects relating to screening individuals with criminal records. Requires the Secretary to maintain a centralized file of representative payees and the individuals they represent. Directs the Secretary to study the need for a more stringent accounting system for high-risk representative payees and report to the Congress on results. Directs the Secretary to implement demonstration projects to make available a listing of addresses of multiple benefit recipients to State agencies primarily responsible for child and adult protective services. Requires the Secretary's annual report to the Congress to include information on representative payees."
