    "text": "Fair Labor Standards Technical Amendments - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (the Act) to revise coverage relating to minimum wage and other requirements. Provides that certain minimum wage and overtime requirements cover employees engaged in industrial homework subject to the Act. Provides that certain equal pay provisions against sex discrimination in wages cover employees engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce. Provides that certain provisions for handicapped workers in sheltered workshops are applicable to such workers who are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or who are employed by an enterprise so engaged. Applies training wage provisions to seasonal agricultural workers under age 20 who are not employed, referred, or transported by a farm labor contractor. Directs the Secretary of Labor, within 90 days, to promulgate regulations that permit computer systems analysts, software engineers, and other similarly skilled professional workers to qualify for the exemption from overtime requirements as professional employees. Provides that if such employees are compensated on an hourly basis, they shall be exempt only if they are compensated at an hourly rate at least six and one-half times greater than the minimum. Makes technical corrections to the special minimum wage provisions for American Samoa."
