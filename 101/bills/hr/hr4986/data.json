Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to submit to the Congress a ten-year Airway Capital Investment Plan (currently, a national airways system plan). Authorizes appropriations for air navigation facilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992 for the general operations of the FAA. Repeals for FY 1991 and 1992 a specified reduction of the maximum amount which may be appropriated from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for costs: (1) of services provided under international agreements relating to the joint financing of air navigation services which are assessed against the United States; and (2) incurred by the Secretary of Transportation to flight check, operate, and maintain air navigation facilities. Sets forth a formula for a higher ceiling on appropriations to cover such costs. Authorizes appropriations for the costs incurred by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in providing the FAA with weather reporting services. Requires the Secretary to develop a system of manned Auxiliary Flight Service Stations. Title II: Federal Aviation Administration Procurement Reform - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to authorize the Administrator of the FAA (currently, the Secretary of Transportation) to procure personal property or services as well as real property on a noncompetitive basis under specified circumstances. Provides for multiyear service and property acquisition contracts with terms of up to five years."
