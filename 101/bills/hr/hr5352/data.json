    "text": "Employee Investment Opportunity Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish opportunity stock options which are granted to an individual for any reason connected with employment by a corporation. Provides for the deferral of income for an individual who exercises an opportunity stock option if: (1) no disposition of shares is made within two years of stock transfer to the individual; and (2) the individual is employed by such corporation at all times during the period beginning on the date of the granting of the option and ending on the day three months before the date of such exercise. Requires, upon disposition of the stock, the inclusion as ordinary income of the excess (\"spread\") of the fair market value of such stock on the date of option exercise over the amount paid for such stock. Allows a business expense deduction to the employer equal to the \"spread\" at the time the individual disposes of such stock. Declares that a grant option shall be deemed to be an opportunity stock option if not more than 60 percent of the value of the grant is received by employees who were senior management employees during the three-year period immediately preceding the date of the grant. Imposes an interest charge on the premature disposition of opportunity stock options."
