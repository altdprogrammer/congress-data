    "text": "Solid Waste Transportation Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require each State to prepare a plan for the management of solid waste generated in the State. Specifies that such plan shall cover a 20-year period and require the State to: (1) identify the amount of solid waste by waste type that is expected to be generated in the State or accepted from another State for disposal in the next 20 years; (2) establish a process to assure the availability of facilities with adequate capacity to treat or dispose of such waste in a manner protective of human health and the environment; and (3) identify the volumes of waste planned to be reduced through source reduction and recycling. Authorizes such plan to include provisions for disposal outside the State of solid waste generated in the State only if the State determines that it does not have, and cannot develop within a reasonable period of time, the landfill or other capacity to handle the disposal of such waste in the State. Requires, in such case, that the plan provide for the establishment of such enforcement mechanisms as necessary to prevent the out-of-State disposal of waste in amounts in excess of those provided for in the plan. Requires States to submit such plans to the Administrator for approval. Specifies that, upon approval of a State plan, the State: (1) may not dispose waste outside of the State, or treat or dispose solid waste in the State, in a manner other than in accordance with such plan; and (2) shall establish a permit program and issue permits to facilities in compliance with such plan and State law. Prohibits the transportation of solid waste for treatment or disposal, following the establishment of a permit program, at any facility that has not been issued a permit. Authorizes any State that has an approved plan to restrict the acceptance of solid waste originating in other States, including a prohibition on medical waste, if such State justifies such restriction on the basis of lack of capacity to handle the disposal of solid waste generated in such State. Sets forth recordkeeping requirements. Authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency or a State to: (1) require any person who generates, transports, or handles solid waste to furnish information and grant access to all records relating to such waste; (2) enter at reasonable times any solid waste facility and inspect and obtain samples of any such waste or any container or label for such waste. Sets penalties for States that fail to submit, or fail to have approved, a plan for solid waste disposal."
