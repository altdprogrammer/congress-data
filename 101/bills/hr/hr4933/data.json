    "text": "Advanced Television Standards Act of 1990 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in carrying out the public interest requirements of the Communications Act of 1934 in the development and promulgation of an advanced television broadcast transmission standard (standard), to promote: (1) the expansion and vitality of telecommunications research and development in the United States; (2) employment and commerce through the manufacture and integration in the United States of advanced television equipment and technology; (3) the suitability of the standard for the transmission or interchange of advanced television programming using other distribution media; and (4) the suitability and flexibility of the standard to accommodate future improvements in television transmission technology. Authorizes appropriations to the FCC for FY 1990 and 1991 for the establishment of an internal advanced television task force, the purchase of testing equipment, and, if necessary, the hiring of additional personnel to assist in the development and promulgation of the standard. Requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to report to specified congressional committees recommending U.S. policy to be pursued before any international body considering the establishment of production and related technical standards with respect to advanced television. Requires NTIA to seek to promote as its principal objective the case of transfer of video programming between domestic and foreign markets and to seek advice from appropriate U.S. business and Federal entities and agencies. Requires semiannual progress reports from NTIA. Requires the FCC to report to the congressional committees on the development, testing, and public demonstration of advanced television systems."
