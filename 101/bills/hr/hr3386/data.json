Requires such regulations to prohibit a person from using, offering, or arranging for the use of a tank truck, rail tank car, cargo tank, or motor or rail vehicle to provide transportation of food, additives, drugs, devices, or cosmetics if the vehicle is used to transport certain nonfood products. Requires appropriate marking of vehicles and prohibits transportation of items in vehicles marked not to handle them. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register lists of: (1) unsafe nonfood products; and (2) of nonfood products whose common transportation does not make such food, food additives, drugs, devices, or cosmetics unsafe to human or animal health. Requires such regulation to prohibit a person from using, offering for use, or arranging for the use of a motor or rail vehicle to provide transportation of asbestos or products which present an extreme danger to human or animal health, despite decontamination procedures, unless such vehicles are used only to provide transportation of such asbestos and dangerous products, and refuse. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any prohibition of this Act if such waiver is not contrary to the public interest. Authorizes the Secretary to provide inspections conducted by State employees to carry out motor carrier safety assistance program under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. Requires the Secretary to develop an inspector training program. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties. Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990 - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation act to require motor carriers which receive an unsatisfactory safety rating to take necessary action to improve such rating to conditional or satisfactory. Prohibits carriers which have not received a conditional or satisfactory rating within a specified time from operating a commercial motor vehicle to transport: (1) hazardous materials; or (2) 15 passengers, including the driver. Prohibits Federal agencies from using a motor carriers with an unsatisfactory safety rating. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue a final rule establishing procedures to ensure the proper and timely correction of commercial motor vehicle safety violations, including an inspection and verification program. Amends Federal law to require specified highway safety specialists to initiate enforcement actions with respect to transportation safety violations, except recordkeeping violations not specified as serious. Requires the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking procedure to adopt measures to make trucks more visible to motorists in order to reduce accidents, especially at night."
