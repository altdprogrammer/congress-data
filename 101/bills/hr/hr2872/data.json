Authorizes the Secretary to charge a fee to cover costs of boarding and examining foreign-flag tank vessels to assure compliance with specified navigational, safety, and pollution prevention regulations. Increases civil penalties for failure to have such a federally licensed pilot on board where required by Federal law."
