    "text": "Urban Schools of America (USA) Act of 1990 - Title I: Urban School Improvement - Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to reserve specified funds for: (1) national activities to evaluate urban school improvement programs; and (2) competitive grant awards to exemplary school programs. Directs the Secretary to allot, from remaining amounts, to each eligible local educational agency (LEA) with an approved application an amount based on relative numbers of students enrolled in the LEA's jurisdiction. Makes an LEA eligible if it: (1) serves the largest city in a State; or (2) enrolls 30,000 or more students as of October 1, 1987, and serves a city with a population of at least 200,000 in a metropolitan statistical area. Requires LEAs to use such funds to: (1) increase the academic achievement of urban school children to at least the national average; (2) prepare all urban children for school; (3) increase the graduation rates of urban students to at least the national average; (4) prepare urban school graduates to enter higher education, pursue careers, and exercise their responsibilities as citizens; (5) recruit and retain qualified teachers; and (6) decrease the use of drugs and alcohol by urban students, enhancing their physical and emotional health. Sets forth program requirements: (1) in general, for initial grants, renewal grants, and renewal of school participation; (2) for achievement, including demonstration of improvement; and (3) data collection. Authorizes the Secretary to reserve funds for competitive awards to schools participating in projects assisted under this title that demonstrate exemplary progress in meeting program requirements. Directs the Secretary, by January 1, 1991, to report on the effects of Federal and State education regulations on urban public schools. Requires LEAs desiring to receive a grant under this Act to establish a local advisory group to: (1) design and conduct a needs assessment for participating schools; (2) assist in planning for community-wide collaboration in service delivery for youths in participating schools; (3) advise the LEA and the community on how they can work together to use multiple service providers; and (4) monitor program implementation and oversee program evaluation. Allows use of a comparable existing local advisory group to comply with such requirement. Sets forth special rules relating to ranking of schools to determine relative needs, in general, on the basis of achievement, poverty, and number of minority students. Requires each LEA receiving a grant to serve between ten and 20 percent of its schools. Requires eligible LEAs to have flexibility to serve homeless children, desegrating students, immigrants, migrants, or other highly mobile populations, even if they do not attend a project school. Deems certain approved programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for education of disadvantaged children to be sufficient to meet plan and criteria requirements of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Repair and Renovation of Urban School Buildings - Authorizes the Secretary to make three-year grants to eligible LEAs for: (1) repair and renovation of school buildings; and (2) improvements related to environmental concerns and safety. Directs the Secretary to allocate funds for both such types of grants on the basis of the number of: (1) children from families below the poverty line; (2) school buildings used for instructional purposes; and (3) school buildings more than 25 years old used for instructional purposes. Requires annual grant review by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Urban School Research - Directs the Secretary to reserve specified funds for the National Urban Research Center established under this title. Allows programs and projects assisted under this title to include: (1) collaborative and coordinated research and evaluation of educational techniques or approaches in multiple cities served by eligible LEAs; (2) evaluation of projects assisted under title I; (3) dissemination of information on successful projects and approaches under title I; (4) design and implementation of programs for LEA provision of technical assistance to individual schools and teachers involved in title I projects; (5) data and information management services for schools participating in a title I program; (6) staff training in such schools; and (7) evaluation of progress in meeting national educational goals by LEAs receiving assistance under this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate a National Urban Research Center to: (1) evaluate, monitor, and disseminate activities assisted under this title; (2) conduct independent research in urban education; and (3) serve as a clearinghouse on urban education research fundings, policies, and practices. Authorizes appropriations.
