Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1990 through 1992. Limits the maximum amount of such a demonstration grant to an eligible critical languages and area studies partnership in any single fiscal year. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires that a consortium eligible for such demonstration grants consist of already incorporated entities located in no fewer than two States, which include at least: (1) one not-for-profit corporation with extensive experience in administering both cultural exchange programs and language and culture training programs in the United States and abroad; (2) one public or private elementary secondary school committed to providing quality language and area studies programs to its students and assisting other schools in the surrounding area; (3) one institution of higher education; and (4) one institution with extensive experience in graduate level training of language instructors."
