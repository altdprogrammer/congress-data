    "text": "Martinez Job Training Partnership Accountability Act of 1989 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (the Act) to establish additional fiscal controls and procurement accountability requirements. Defines \"profit\" to mean any revenue in excess of expenditures. Increases the maximum portions of specified program funds for a service delivery area which may be used for administrative costs, or for a combination of administrative and work experience program costs. Requires the Secretary of Labor to define all cost categories comprehensively. Establishes procurement standards with which all recipients, subrecipients, or service providers receiving funds under the Act must adequately demonstrate that they have complied. Directs the Secretary to issue various regulations relating to such standards, prohibiting conflicts of interest or restrictions of competition, and requiring recipients to perform cost and price analyses in connection with each procurement action, including contract modifications. Requires the Secretary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking within three months, allow at least 60 days for public comment, and issue final regulations within six months."
