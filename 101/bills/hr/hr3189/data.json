    "text": "National Environmental Policy on International Financing Act of 1989 - Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to require that before casting the U.S. vote on a proposed action by an international financial institution significantly affecting the quality of the environment, the appropriate Federal official request such institution to furnish an environmental impact statement. Requires such official to identify: (1) any minimum criteria not met; and (2) any pertinent information absent from the statement but available elsewhere. Requires such official to: (1) inform the management of such institutions of the expected nature of such statements; and (2) begin negotiations with their personnel to facilitate the conduct of environmental impact assessments. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) make Federal personnel available upon request to assist an institution in making such assessments; (2) take steps with both donor and borrower nations to expand international consensus on environmental needs; and (3) file a detailed status report with specified congressional committees on the institution's implementation of procedures for systematically assessing the environmental impact of its activities. Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to report to certain congressional committees on the efficacy of U.S. efforts to encourage timely environmental impact assessment within international financial institutions."
