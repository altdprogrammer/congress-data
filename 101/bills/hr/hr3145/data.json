    "text": "Consultant Disclosure and Fraud Prevention Act of 1989 - Defines the term \"covered consultant\" as any individual who knowingly receives aggregate compensation of $5,000 in any calendar quarter or $10,000 in any calendar year for contacting a Federal agency on behalf of any applicant for Federal assistance worth more than $100,000. Excludes from such definition: (1) any salaried employee who works an average of 20 hours per week for the applicant during the applicable period; and (2) any individual who is retained by any applicant or recipient to provide technical architectural or engineering services. Requires covered consultants to submit a report within 30 days after the end of each applicable calendar period during which they received such compensation to the inspector general of the agency contacted or to the Administrator of General Services when such agency does not have an inspector general. Requires such report to contain: (1) certain information identifying the covered consultant, the consultant's employers, and the applicants on whose behalf contacts were made; (2) the total amount of compensation received; and (3) a statement of whether the consultant was employed with the Government within two years of the beginning of such calendar period and, if so, the most recent position title, agency of employment, and salary; (4) a description of any Federal assistance involved; and (5) the names and titles of agency employees or officials contacted. Establishes penalties for failure to submit information as required by this Act. Prohibits anyone convicted of violating this Act from receiving payment for performing any services with respect to any application for Federal assistance for any applicant for three years."
