Requires the Administrator to issue a detailed environmental impact statement regarding proposed changes to air routes at or below an altitude of 19,000 feet. Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to review and publish in the Federal Register by a certain date how commercial air routes proposed by the FAA Administrator comply with certain noise control criteria. Prohibits the FAA Administrator from excluding air commerce operations from certain environmental requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 on the basis of altitude. Requires the FAA Administrator to report to the Congress the results of a commercial aircraft noise level study."
