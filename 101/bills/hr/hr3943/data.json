    "text": "Tobacco Product Education and Health Protection Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to add a new title establishing, at the Centers for Disease Control, a Center for Tobacco Products to coordinate Federal education and research with regard to tobacco products. Directs the Center to conduct certain activities, including to study tobacco product additives and disclose their health risks to consumers and to establish ten model State programs to enforce laws concerning the sale of tobacco products to minors. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993. Transfers functions of the Federal Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health to the Center. Amends the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act to require the establishment of an outreach program to youth about the health consequences of smoking. Directs the Center to make grants: (1) for public information campaigns concerning the use of tobacco products; (2) to States for anti-tobacco use programs and programs to limit youth access to tobacco products; and (3) to unions and others to attempt to reduce the incidence of smoking among workers. Requires the establishment of a program, with an Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health, to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking and by smokeless tobacco products. Requires related reports to the Congress. Details administrative requirements of grants. Imposes criminal penalties allowing seizure of such products, and penalties against retailers engaged in a pattern of sale to minors. Declares tobacco products to be misbranded for not disclosing to the public information on additives and harmful constituents. Describes conditions which constitute adulteration of tobacco products, including if the product contains any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, or package any tobacco product unless the person has provided the Center: (1) a complete list of tobacco additives and the quantity of each; and (2) a complete list of all brands that includes the levels of tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other constituents for each brand. Makes it unlawful to engage in certain types of advertising and promotion of tobacco products. Provides for establishment of an advisory committee to give advice on promulgation of regulations imposing additional restrictions or requirements on tobacco advertising and promotion. Repeals the Federal preemption of State regulation of local tobacco advertising, allowing the enactment by States and local governments of additional restrictions on the sale of tobacco products to minors and on the placement of tobacco advertising displayed solely within the applicable geographic area. Makes conforming amendments to the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986. Changes the warning label on cigarettes."
