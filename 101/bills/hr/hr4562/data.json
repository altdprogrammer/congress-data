Removes goods or technology which no longer meet the performance levels increased pursuant to such procedures from the commodity control list unless a U.S. agency objects to such removal and the Secretary determines subsequently that they shall not be removed. Directs the Secretary to require technical advisory committees to establish indexing procedures for certain goods or technology."
