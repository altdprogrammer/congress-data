Requires the Commission to develop for each region of the United States standards for the construction of structures which would minimize loss of life and damage to property in an earthquake. Requires such standards to reflect the probability of an earthquake in such region. Requires the Commission to report to the President and the Congress on the construction standards. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report to the President and the Congress which designates earthquake probability zones in the United States and estimates the probability and severity of earthquakes in each zone. Directs the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to report to the President and the Congress an estimate of the impact that implementation of the standards developed by the Commission would have on the cost and availability of residential and commercial structures in each zone. Directs the President to issue standards for the construction of structures in each zone. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny the deductibility of certain charges and expenses with respect to structures which do not meet the earthquake construction standards under this Act."
