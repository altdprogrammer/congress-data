    "text": "Amends the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act to prohibit: (1) the siting of a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in an area whose average annual rainfall exceeds 18 inches per year; and (2) the shallow land burial of low-level radioactive waste at any disposal site. Removes class C low-level radioactive waste disposal responsibility from the States and leaves it with the Federal Government. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to reimburse certain compact-member States for losses incurred as a result of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Absolves such States from financial or legal liability for failure to comply with the requirements of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act as a result of compliance with this Act. Exempts existing low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities from the requirements of this Act."
