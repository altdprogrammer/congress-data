    "text": "Nontidal Wetlands Protection Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize States with approved wetlands management plans to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material onto wetlands. Requires the Secretary of the Army to transfer permit administration authorities to such States. Permits States to submit wetlands management plans to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for approval. Sets forth plan approval procedures. Prohibits approval of a plan unless the plan: (1) identifies all State wetlands based upon categories established under this Act and the watersheds within which each wetland area is located; (2) satisfies specified permit and compensation mitigation requirements; (3) designates a State official as the State Wetlands Management Administrator; and (4) is developed in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary and meets this Act's requirements. Establishes wetlands categories and sets forth specified discharge permit and compensation mitigation requirements for each category. Provides for the biennial review of State wetlands management plans. Requires the Administrator to revoke a State's authority to administer permits if the State's plan review is unsatisfactory."
