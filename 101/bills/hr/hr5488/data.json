    "text": "Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture, notwithstanding certain other provisions, to reserve a specified amount from sums appropriated to carry out the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC Program) to be allocated to State agencies that experience funding emergencies. Declares that a funding emergency occurs when a State agency uses all the funds allocated to the agency before the end of a fiscal year because unanticipated inflation causes increases in the costs of the foods. Replaces provisions requiring certain steps relating to cost containment with provisions requiring a State to implement a competitive bidding system for each product distributed under the program. Requires that the formula for the division of funds ensure that a State with a level of program participation, as a percentage of its eligible population, that exceeds the national average not receive amounts greater than it received the preceeding fiscal year, adjusted for inflation. Directs the Secretary, in determining the level of program participation, to adjust for any non-Federal funds that are expended to provide supplemental foods under the program."
