Limits the amount of such funds available for capital improvements to facilities not located at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 to the District of Columbia Commission on Mental Health Services for carrying out mental health training programs at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. Extends from October 1, 1991, to October 1, 1993, the deadline by which the District of Columbia must have in operation an integrated coordinated mental health system and complete repairs and renovations to Saint Elizabeths Hospital. Requires the Congress to approve the Mayor's master plan for the use of that portion of Saint Elizabeths Hospital not yet transferred to the District of Columbia within two years, rather than one year, after the Mayor submits such plan to the Congress."
