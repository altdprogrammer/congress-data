    "text": "Immigration Legal Numerical Limitation and Preference Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a two-tiered immigration annual entry level made up of \"family connection\" immigrants and \"independent\" (employment-related) immigrants (plus current fifth preference backlog reduction visas of up to 100,000 per year for each of FY 1990 through 1992). Establishes worldwide fiscal year levels of: (1) 103,000 for \"family connection\" immigrants; and (2) 200,000 minus 50,000 for each of FY 1991 through 1993 plus any unused family connection visas. Revises the immigration admissions preference system to allocate family connection preferences as follows: (1) unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens or permanent residents; (2) married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens or permanent residents; and (3) unmarried brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens and backlogged married brothers and sisters. Allocates independent preferences as follows: (1) aliens holding doctoral degrees; (2) aliens who are members of the professions or of exceptional ability; (3) skilled workers; (4) employment creation (minimum $1,000,000 capital investment which will create at least ten jobs); and (5) selected immigrants chosen on a point system basis. Sets forth the following system criteria: (1) English fluency; (2) equalization of immigration source countries (based upon a country's percentage of world population or 1956-1965 U.S. immigration levels); (3)occupational demand; (4) arranged employment; (5) education; and (6) age. Terminates the registration of an alien who fails to apply for an immigrant visa within one year of availability unless the alien establishes within two years of such time that such failure was due to circumstances beyond his or her control. Permits visa petitions based on immediate relative, family connection, and independent status to be filed with the Attorney General. Establishes a two-year conditional permanent resident status for certain alien entrepreneurs and their families. Subjects an alien to deportation and criminal penalties for entrepreneurship fraud. Sets forth related application and interview requirements. Reduces the naturalization U.S. residency requirement from five years to three years."
