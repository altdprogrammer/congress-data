    "text": "Fur Seal Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Fur Seal Act Amendments of 1983 to direct the Secretary of Commerce, when a fishery management plan takes effect that would establish a limited entry or access program related to the ground-fish fishery of the Bering Sea, to immediately provide an annual allocation of ten percent of the total allowable catch of that fishery to the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. Requires the establishment in accordance with State law of a Pribilof Aleut Fisheries Development Association to accept and manage the allocation. Requires the Association to be formed by agreement among the Alaska Native village corporations and the Indian Reorganization Act entities for the Islands. Makes the allocation effective only on the determination by the Secretary that the Association has been established. Allows the allocation to be transferred or assigned, in whole or in part: (1) during the first five years the allocation is made, by the Association to certain individuals; and (2) thereafter, by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under the applicable fishery management plan."
