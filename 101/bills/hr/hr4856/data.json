Sets forth eligibility requirements. Permits such grants to be used for technical assistance to: (1) interpret information with regard to the nature of the hazardous waste to be managed at the facility; (2) interpret information concerning the potential threats to human health, the environment, and the economy posed by the facility; (3) interpret information regarding the suitability of the proposed site and the record of the permit applicant; and (4) prepare views for presentation at a public hearing on the issuance of the permit. Limits the amount of such grants. Requires grant recipients to contribute a specified percentage of the costs of the assistance. Waives the contribution requirement under certain circumstances."
