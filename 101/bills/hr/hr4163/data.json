Prohibits shipping in interstate commerce, manufacturing, assembling, or importing any such television except pursuant to rules by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Requires such rules to provide performance and display standards for such built-in decoder circuitry. Requires the FCC, within five years, to evaluate compatibility issues and advancements in TV technology and take any action it deems necessary to amend such rules to ensure that such decoder chip circuitry is capable of continuing service to closed-caption consumers regardless of new broadcast technologies."
