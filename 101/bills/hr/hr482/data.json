Provides that the location of a principal office outside of the District of Columbia may only be carried out after: (1) consideration is given to agency needs and mission, the best interests of the United States, and economic impact; and (2) appropriate Federal, State, and local officials are consulted. Exempts the principal office of an executive department from the provisions of this Act. Requires the head of each executive department and the Administrator of General Services to report to the Congress on the components of the principal office in terms of personnel, operations, and facilities."
