Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on such study. Requires the Administrator, no later than six months after the effective date of final regulations revising the asbestos National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, to report to the Congress on the geographic patterns of disposal of asbestos-containing material.
