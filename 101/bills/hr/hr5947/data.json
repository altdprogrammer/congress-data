Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) notification requirements before moving such animals; and (2) inspections for violations committed under this Act. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate rules establishing standards for a physical environment adequate to promote the psychological well-being of animals protected under this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory board to make recommendations with respect to such regulations. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Sets forth specified exemptions."
