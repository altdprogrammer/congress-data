Requires an inmate in such program, for up to six months of initial imprisonment, to: (1) adhere to a highly regimented schedule that provides the strict discipline, physical training, hard labor, drill, and ceremony characteristic of military basic training; and (2) participate in appropriate job training and educational (including literacy) programs and drug, alcohol, and other counseling programs. Specifies that an inmate who has successfully completed the required period of shock incarceration shall remain in the custody of the Bureau for such period (not to exceed the remainder of the prison term otherwise required) and under such conditions as the Bureau deems appropriate. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Attorney General to make available to the States and local governments the services of U.S. prisoners for public works projects."
