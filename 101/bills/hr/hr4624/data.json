    "text": "Central European Outreach Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to triple the number of professional personnel assigned to the Office of Eastern European and Soviet Affairs of the Department of Commerce. Urges the assignment of at least 75 additional foreign service officers to Central Europe (Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993 to establish and expand Peace Corps programs in Central European countries. Authorizes the Export-Import Bank to guarantee, insure, finance, and extend credit in connection with the purchase or lease of products by Czechoslovakia, East Germany, or Yugoslavia. Expresses the sense of the Congress that in order to expand the direct loan program of the Bank into Central Europe, the ceiling provided in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991, with respect to such loan program for FY 1991 should be at least $85,000,000 higher than the ceiling for FY 1990, with the increase earmarked for direct loans to Central Europe. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to make Czechoslovakia and East Germany eligible for Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) programs. Increases the amount of funds for loans made by OPIC under the direct investment program in order to expand direct investment in Central Europe. Expresses the sense of the Congress that in order to expand the OPIC's loan guaranty program into Central Europe, the ceiling provided in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991, with respect to such loan guarantees for FY 1991 should be at least $80,000,000 higher than the ceiling for FY 1990, with the increase earmarked for loans to Central Europe. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to require the President to instruct the Secretary of State to seek the approval of the Coordinating Committee for the removal of controls on exports of goods or technology to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland that are at a level not exceeding that to which exports to China require only notification of the governments participating in the Committee. Declares that exports which exceed such levels shall be processed on a case-by-case basis with the proper referral. Declares that the removal of such controls against East Germany will take effect if the President determines such country is continuing to make progress toward market liberalization and political pluralism."
