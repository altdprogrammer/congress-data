Phases out, over three years beginning in 1991, the requirement that 25 percent of the gross tonnage of certain U.S. exports be transported on U.S.-flag commercial vessels. Requires the Secretary of State to initiate discussions with Canada to reduce or eliminate all tolls on the International Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the progress of such discussions."
