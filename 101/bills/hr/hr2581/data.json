Requires the Administrator to establish a solicitation, review, and evaluation process that ensures: (1) the funding of proposals having relevancy to the mission of the FAA; (2) an equitable geographical distribution of grant funds; and (3) the inclusion of historically black colleges and universities for such funding. Directs the Administrator to report annually to specified congressional committees regarding the research grant program. Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to make a specified percentage of funds under the Airport and Airway Trust Fund available for such grants."
