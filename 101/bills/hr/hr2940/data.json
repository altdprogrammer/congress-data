    "text": "Merchant Mariner Memorial Act of 1989 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to convey to a group of two or three nonprofit organizations, without consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United States in a vessel which is in the National Defense Reserve Fleet on the date of enactment of this Act, is of a specified minimum displacement tonnage, has no usefulness to the Government, and is scheduled to be scrapped. Requires each organization in the group to: (1) agree with the other organizations in that group to sell the vessel for scrap and divide the proceeds equally; (2) use its share to establish a merchant mariners' memorial; (3) have raised a minimum amount from non-Federal sources before enactment of this Act; and (4) agree to any other conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. Allows organizations to apply individually or as members of a group. Authorizes the Secretary to designate groups from organizations which apply individually. Prohibits organizations from belonging to more than one group. Terminates the Secretary's authority to convey vessels two years after enactment of this Act."
