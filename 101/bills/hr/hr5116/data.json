Mandates that such plans contain alternatives for complying with Northern Spotted Owl endangered species conservation criteria in a manner minimizing employment disruption in public timber-dependent communities. Requires submission of plans to the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by a specified deadline. Requires the Director to respond in writing to such alternatives. Authorizes appropriations."
