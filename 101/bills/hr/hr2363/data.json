    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-05-16", 
    "text": "Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1989 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize a cable television franchising authority, in its request for proposals for a franchise, to require: (1) that the cable system carry the signal of any broadcast station if any portion of the area covered by such franchise lies within the local service area of such broadcast station; (2) that the cable systems carry the commercially available video transmissions of the games of any organized professional sports team if any portion of the area covered by such franchise lies within the home territory of such team; or (3) both. Authorizes a franchising authority to modify cable television franchise agreements in effect to impose such requirements, unless the cable operator demonstrates commercial impracticability. Considers the law of any State or franchising authority which imposed such requirements as a consumer protection law consistent with the Communications Act of 1934. Requires the cable franchising authority (currently the cable operator) to set the price, terms, and conditions of the commercial use of cable television channel capacity by a person unaffiliated with a cable franchising authority. Places a ten-year limitation on cable television franchise agreements. Prohibits any cable operator from entering into any agreement with a producer, distributor, or supplier of cable programming which: (1) gives that operator exclusive rights to that programming within the franchise area; or (2) prevents or hinders another multichannel video program distribution system from purchasing or retransmitting that programming. States that nothing in this Act shall prohibit a common carrier from leasing telephone facilities or equipment to any franchising authority, cable operator, or other applicant that is not owned by, controlled by, or under common control with such common carrier."
