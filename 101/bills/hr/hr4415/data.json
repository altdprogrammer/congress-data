    "text": "Public Television Cable Carriage Act of 1990 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require each cable operator to carry on its cable system the signals of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station (QLNETS) according to provisions of this Act. Requires the operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels to carry only one QLNETS on such system, while allowing other QLNETSs to be carried at the discretion of the operator. Allows a cable operator which operated beyond the presence of any QLNETS to carry the system of one qualified noncommercial educational station (QNETS) (a nonlocal station) at its discretion. Requires a cable operator with a system of 13 to 36 usable activated channels to carry at least one but not more than three QLNETSs, while allowing other QLNETSs to be carried at its discretion. Requires the cable operator of a system which increases its usable activated channel capacity to more than 36 stations on or after March 29, 1990, to carry on such system each QLNETS requesting carriage, subject to other provisions of this Act. Requires all cable operators to continue to provide carriage to all QLNETSs carried on their systems as of March 29, 1990. Allows such requirement to be waived upon the written consent of the cable operator and any such station. Provides that a cable operator with a capacity of more than 36 channels which is required to carry three QLNETSs shall not be required to carry additional QLNETSs if their programming substantially duplicates the programming broadcast by another QLNETS requesting carriage. Requires a cable operator to retransmit in its entirety the primary video and audio transmission of each QLNETS carried on its cable system, as well as material necessary for the receipt of programming by handicapped persons or for educational or language purposes. Prohibits a QLNETS from being repositioned to a different channel by a cable operator unless the operator notifies the station and all cable subscribers at least 30 days in advance of such change. States that a cable operator: (1) shall not be required to carry any QLNETS which does not deliver a signal of good quality as defined by the Federal Communications Commission; (2) is prohibited from accepting monetary payment or other consideration in exchange for carriage of the signal of a QLNETS, except for certain carriage delivery costs; and (3) is not required to add a QLNETS not already required as of March 29, 1990, where such station would be considered a distant signal for copyright purposes, unless such station reimburses the operator for incremental copyright costs assessed against the operator as the result of such carriage."
