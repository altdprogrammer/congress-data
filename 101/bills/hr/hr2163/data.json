Deletes the requirement that such property be used for a commercial activity. Adds as exceptions to the immunity from attachment or execution that: (1) in the case of a claim based upon acts of violence in the United States intended to result or actually resulting in bodily harm, such property is used or intended to be used for a commercial activity in the United States; and (2) such property belongs to a foreign state engaged in a commercial activity in the United States and the judgment relates to a claim for which the foreign state is not immune from jurisdiction by virtue of a general exception to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state or as a result of certain counterclaims."
