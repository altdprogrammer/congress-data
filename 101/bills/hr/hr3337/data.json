Title II: Accountability in the Payment of Official Mail Costs - Establishes the Senate Official Mail Costs Account within the contingent fund of the Senate and the House Official Mail Costs Account within the contingent fund of the House of Representatives. Requires the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards to prescribe rules and regulations governing franked mail. Requires a Member of Congress to repay postage costs in excess of the amount allocated to such Member. Requires quarterly reports to Members on expenses incurred by them for mass mail. Requires a separate appropriation for the House and the Senate for franked mailings. Requires unsolicited mass mailings to contain a notice of taxpayer financing of such mailings. Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1973 to require official mail costs of Senators to be paid exclusively through the Senate Official Mail Costs Account. Prohibits the Postal Service from transmitting franked mail after appropriations for such mail have been expended unless additional funds are appropriated and paid to the Postal Service."
