Allows current members of the armed forces to fill the initial staff requirements of the Corps for no longer than five years after enactment of this Act, unless certain conditions have been met. Requires the Corps to carry out all procurement functions of the Department of Defense (DOD). Requires the Corps to: (1) operate as the sole negotiator between the private sector and DOD in defense procurement business; (2) seek and receive evaluations and advice from specified officials within DOD about the need and justification for property and services; and (3) carry out functions and relevant acquisition regulations of DOD relating to the research, development, and production of property and services. Requires the Secretary of Defense to be the chief liaison between DOD and the Corps for purposes of communicating the views of DOD, including the military departments and defense agencies, on acquisition matters. Prohibits a person from serving as Director if such person has been employed by a defense contractor or the Corps, has served on active duty with the armed forces, or has been a consultant to DOD during the three-year period before being nominated as Director. Prohibits a former Director from accepting compensation for a period of five years after leaving office from any person under contract with DOD or the Corps during the period in which such person served as Director. Provides similar three-year limitations for staff members of the Corps. Requires the Director to submit to the President, the Congress, and the Secretary of Defense annual reports on the activities of the Corps. Terminates the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. Transfers to the Director all procurement functions from various offices within the departments and agencies of DOD. Title II: Inspector General for Defense Procurement - Establishes the Office of the Inspector General for Defense Procurement as an independent office in the executive branch. Requires the Inspector General to appoint: (1) an Assistant Inspector General for Auditing who shall be responsible for auditing the programs and operations of the Corps; and (2) an Assistant Inspector General for Investigations who shall be responsible for supervising the performance of investigative activities relating to such programs and operations. Prohibits a person from serving as Inspector General if such person has been employed by, or has been a consultant to, a person under contract with DOD or the Corps, has served on active duty as an officer in the armed forces, or has been a consultant to DOD during the five-year period ending on the date on which the person is nominated to be Inspector General. Prohibits a former Inspector General from accepting compensation for five years after serving in such position from any person under contract with DOD or the Corps during the period in which the person served as Inspector General. Provides similar three-year limitations for employees of the Office. Prohibits any member of the armed forces, active or reserve, from being appointed to the Office under this Act."
