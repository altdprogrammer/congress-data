Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to establish a National High Speed Rail Transportation Policy to promote the design, construction, and operation of high speed rail transportation systems in the United States. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to guarantee obligations used to acquire, rehabilitate, or establish high speed rail facilities or equipment. Prohibits such guarantees until the Secretary finds, in the case of high speed rail facilities and equipment, that at least 85 percent of such items are manufactured in the United States. Requires the Secretary before extending such guarantees to receive assurances from the obligor that he or she will not use any assets from high speed rail operations for purposes other than high speed rail purposes if such use will impair the obligor's ability to provide high speed rail services in an efficient and economic manner, or will adversely affect the obligor's ability to perform any obligation guaranteed by the Secretary. Requires the Comptroller General to report annually to specified congressional committees concerning high speed rail facilities and equipment."
