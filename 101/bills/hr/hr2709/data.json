    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-06-21", 
    "text": "Comprehensive Violent Crime Control Act of 1989 - Title I: Firearms and Related Amendments - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of firearms to non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides. Provides for the disposition of forfeited firearms. Classifies as serious drug offenses for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 serious drug offenses committed by juveniles. Specifies that if a conviction was for a violent felony involving the threatened or actual use of a firearm or explosives, or was for a serious drug offense, such person shall be considered convicted for purposes of this Act irrespective of any pardon, setting aside, expunction, or restoration of civil rights. Permits the judicial officer to consider pretrial detention with respect to certain firearms and explosives offenses. Provides for enhanced penalties for: (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses. Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives. Bars the sale or possession of firearms and explosives to or by persons convicted of violent or serious misdemeanor drug or narcotic offenses. Provides for the mandatory revocation of the supervised release of an individual for possession of a firearm. Increases penalties for: (1) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (2) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a Federal felony. Prohibits the assembly of semiautomatic rifles or shotguns which are prohibited from being imported into the United States, with exceptions. Title II: Capital Punishment - Capital Punishment Procedures Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Sets forth special aggravating factors for espionage, treason, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President. Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified based on consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating factors. States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Sets forth procedures for the implementation of the sentence of death. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) \"murder for hire\"; (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); and (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death. Increases the minimum sentence to life imprisonment for the crime of bank robbery which results in death. Provides for appointment of counsel where a defendant is charged with a crime with respect to which a sentence of death is sought and is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Title III: Prohibited Gun Clips and Magazines - Includes ammunition feeding devices (AFDs) within the definition of firearms for purposes of Federal firearms laws. Defines an AFD to include any detachable magazine, feed strip, or similar device which has a capacity of, or which can be readily converted to accept, more than 15 rounds of ammunition, with exceptions. Prohibits the importation, manufacture, transfer, receipt, or possession of AFDs, with exceptions. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain a central registry of all such devices transferred after the effective date of this Act which, after such transfer, are not under the control of the United States or any State or political subdivision. Specifies that such registry shall include: (1) identification of the device; (2) date of registration; (3) identification and address of the person entitled to possess the device; and (4) such other information as may be required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Establishes additional registration procedures. Requires all AFDs to be identified by a serial number and such other identification as the Secretary may prescribe. Provides for criminal penalties for violation of provisions of this Act relative to AFDs. Authorizes specified individuals engaged in the manufacture or importation of AFDs requiring a license to continue to engage in such business pending final action on the application. Title IV: Drug Testing of Defendants on Post-Conviction Release - Requires: (1) the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to establish a program of drug testing of criminal defendants on post-conviction release; and (2) the chief probation officer in each district to arrange for the drug testing of such defendants. Requires, as an explicit condition of probation, parole, or supervised release of a defendant involving a felony or a specified violent or drug offense, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to periodic drug tests. Sets limitations on the authority to require such tests and to take action against a defendant based on test results. Title V: Exclusionary Rule - Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that evidence obtained by a search or seizure undertaken in an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution is admissible. States that evidence obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant constitutes prima facie evidence of such a reasonable belief. States that, except as provided by statute or a rule of procedure prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, evidence which is otherwise admissible shall not be excluded on the ground that the evidence was obtained in violation of a law, rule, or regulation. Title VI: Habeas Corpus Reform - Reform of Federal Intervention in State Proceedings Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal judicial code to condition consideration of a habeas corpus claim by a prisoner on a showing of actual prejudice resulting from the Federal right violated and that: (1) State or Federal Government action precluded assertion of that right; (2) the Federal right did not previously exist; (3) the factual basis of the claim could not have been discovered by reasonable diligence; or (4) the violation asserted probably resulted in an erroneous conviction, a sentence predicated on an erroneous conviction, or a sentence predicated on an erroneous factual determination. Establishes a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners, and a two-year statute of limitations for similar motions made by Federal prisoners. Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. Permits denial on the merits of habeas corpus writs notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. Prohibits the granting of a habeas corpus writ with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings. Provides for appointment of counsel for a petitioner who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel at the court's discretion, with exceptions. Title VII: 1990 Fiscal Year Authorization - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 to the Department of Justice for: (1) general administration; (2) the Office of Inspector General; (3) the United States Parole Commission; (4) general legal activities; (5) the Antitrust Division; (6) the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission; (7) United States Attorneys; (8) the United States Marshals Service; (9) the support of United States prisoners in non-Federal institutions; (10) fees and expenses of witnesses; (11) the Community Relations Service; (12) the United States Trustees System Fund; (13) the Assets Forfeiture Fund; (14) organized crime drug enforcement; (15) the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (16) the Drug Enforcement Administration; (17) the Immigration and Naturalization Service; (18) the Federal Prison System; and (19) Office of Justice Programs."
