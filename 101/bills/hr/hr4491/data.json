    "text": "Coast Guard Omnibus Act of 1990 - Amends the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act of 1971 to require every power-driven vessel of 20 meters or more in length to have a radiotelephone while navigating. (Currently, the requirement applies to every power-driven vessel of 300 gross tons and upward.) Deems the Sidney Lanier Bridge at mile 6.3 on the Brunswick River in Georgia to be an obstruction to navigation. Amends Federal law to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue a permit exempting three specified vessels from passenger vessel inspection requirements so long as such vessels are owned by nonprofit organizations and operated as nonprofit memorials to merchant mariners. Provides for the biennial designation of members of the Board of Visitors to the Coast Guard Academy. Declares that certain Federal measurement of vessel requirements shall not apply to barges (except a barge engaged on a foreign voyage) unless the owner of the barge requests. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating or the Commandant of the Coast Guard to require, under specified circumstances, the posting of a bond by contractors for the construction of Coast Guard vessels. Exempts seagoing, self-propelled hopper dredges from Federal laws requiring vessels to be under the control of a licensed pilot. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to quitclaim without consideration to the Town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, all rights, title, and interest of the United States in Coast Guard property and improvements at Reynolds Channel, Atlantic Beach, New York. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to transfer without consideration all rights, title, and interest of the United States in certain Coast Guard property to the city of South Haven, Michigan. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to transfer without consideration to the Secretary of Commerce all rights, title, and interest of the United States in certain Coast Guard property and improvements in the city of Muskegon, Michigan. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to make such property available to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Prohibits the use of authorized FY 1992 funds by the Coast Guard to acquire additional information resources, including information equipment, until the Commandant of the Coast Guard develops a strategic information resources plan. Revises Federal law relating to the computation of Federal funds allocated to States for recreational boating safety programs. Directs the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to transfer without compensation to Dare County, North Carolina, all rights, title, and interest of the United States in Coast Guard property and improvements located in that county. Deems Bayou Lafourche, Louisiana, between the Percy Brown Road (Hwy 648), and the Southern Pacific Railroad bridge crossing the bayou, to be a navigable waterway. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 to the University of Alaska to establish a Cold Water Survival Training Center in Kenai, Alaska."
