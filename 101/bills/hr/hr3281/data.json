Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 to prohibit through such date any increase in premiums for national flood insurance coverage. Requires certain flood-risk zone data and probable flood-loss estimates to be updated through FY 1991. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to report any determination that the current flood insurance program cannot be carried out or that such program requires Government assumption of the operational responsibility for flood insurance to the Congress and the private insurance companies participating in the program. Prohibits the Director, upon making such a determination, from implementing the revised flood insurance program until nine months after the submission of such report unless it would otherwise be impossible to continue to carry out the national flood insurance program. Extends through FY 1991 the authorization of appropriations for certain studies in connection with the national flood insurance program. Requires the Director to conduct a study, and report to the Congress, on the impact of relative sea level rise on the flood insurance rate maps. Amends the National Housing Act to: (1) extend through FY 1991 the general authority of the Director to carry out the national crime insurance program; and (2) extend through FY 1992 the reinsurance and direct insurance under such program. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 to prohibit the premiums charged for crime insurance under provisions of the National Housing Act from being increased by more than 15 percent annually through FY 1991. (Currently, the annual rate is no more than five percent through FY 1989.) Requires the Director to report at least annually (currently biennially) on the national crime insurance program under the National Housing Act. Amends the National Housing Act of 1949 to extend through FY 1990: (1) the authority for the provision of direct and insured loans to provide housing and related facilities for elderly persons and families in rural areas; (2) the current determinations for rural area classification; and (3) the authorization of appropriations for mutual self-help housing grant and loan authority. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 to extend through FY 1990 the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to carry out a rural rental rehabilitation demonstration program. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to extend through FY 1990 the emergency homeownership counseling program. Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to extend the expiration date of such Act to August 10, 1990. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 for the purchase of metals, minerals, and other materials for Government use or resale. Limits the aggregate amounts of certain loans, guarantees, and purchase agreements under the Act during FY 1990."
