Allocates sufficient water to the States of California and Nevada from such river and its tributaries to serve beneficial uses not encompassed in such decree and initiated prior to the effective date of this Act. Establishes a right to compensation to California for any discontinuance of waters of such river and its tributaries, subject to specified conditions. Authorizes the State of Nevada, its agencies, or private entities and individuals to construct storage facilities within the Carson River Basin, with a specified condition. Confirms under the court decree: (1) the right to change water use from irrigation to storage for municipal or industrial uses; and (2) the storage, release, and use of water as determined by reservoir capacity and river yields. Allows water so diverted to be stored for use in current or subsequent years. Sets limits on the annual gross diversions for use within the Lake Tahoe Basin from natural sources. Specifies allocations for California and Nevada and conditions for measuring such diversions. Authorizes specified transbasin diversions from the Lake Tahoe Basin to the extent permitted under State law. Allocates to California the right to divert and extract a specified portion of water from the Truckee River Basin in California. Confirms such State's right to such water under the court decree. Allocates to Nevada the remaining unused portion of water from the Truckee River Basin after diversion by California of its allotted portion. Authorizes each State to provide for voluntary interstate transfers of water or water rights within the Basin subject to the provisions of this Act. Provides that water used by the United States or by Indian tribes and water extracted or diverted from one State for use in another State shall be charged to the allocation of the State in which the water is used. Title II: Truckee River Management - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the agreement signed by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe and Sierra Pacific Power Company on May 23, 1989 (Preliminary Settlement Agreement), including contracts for the use of space in Truckee River reservoirs for the storage and exchange of water, if certain conditions are met. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement projects for the rehabilitation of existing Truckee River water diversion facilities in order to improve their efficiency. Authorizes appropriations.

Title IV: Cui-ui and Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Enhancement Program - Directs the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, the State of Nevada, and the Secretary of the Interior, to develop and implement a project for the rehabilitation of the Lower Truckee River for the benefit of the Pyramid Lake Fishery. Authorizes appropriations.

Outlines criteria for the development of such plans. Directs the Secretary to replace or reimburse Sierra Pacific Power Company for reductions in hydroelectric power generated at plants on the Truckee River resulting from implementation of the Preliminary Settlement Agreement. Title V: Pyramid Lake Development Fund - Establishes within the Treasury the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribal Development Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund. Requires all appropriated funds to be used for economic development. Grants the Tribe complete discretion to invest and manage such funds, subject to specified conditions. Title VI: Newlands Project - Provides that all payment obligations owed the United States or its agencies by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District shall be cancelled by the Secretary, provided that such District shall have the right to collect all unpaid construction costs. Makes the District responsible for the operation and control of the Newlands Project lands, works, and rights, subject to repair and maintenance regulations that the Secretary may adopt. Requires Project operating criteria to be agreed upon by the District and the Secretary and approved by the Paiute Tribe and the State of Nevada. Establishes in the Treasury the Nevada Settlement Fund. Authorizes appropriations to such Fund. Outlines Fund uses, including improvement of physical facilities within Carson Lake and the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area, improvement of cui-ui spawning habitats, and the rehabilitation of certain dams, canals, and other improvements within the State of Nevada.
