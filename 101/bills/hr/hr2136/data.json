    "text": "District of Columbia Civil Contempt Imprisonment Limitation Act of 1989 - Amends the District of Columbia Code to limit the term of incarceration for civil contempt in child custody cases to 12 months, except in cases where a person incarcerated for civil contempt is charged with criminal contempt for failure to comply with a court order. Provides that an individual may be charged for criminal contempt no earlier than six months and no later than 12 months after incarceration for civil contempt in a child custody case, and be imprisoned until the completion of the trial for criminal contempt, but in no case for more than 18 months. Requires that such criminal contempt trial: (1) begin within 90 days after the individual is charged with criminal contempt; (2) be a trial by jury upon such individual's request; and (3) not be conducted before the judge who incarcerated such individual for contempt. Requires the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to hear an appeal from an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia holding an individual in contempt and imposing imprisonment on such individual in the course of a child custody case within 60 days after such individual requests such appeal. Directs the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on the District of Columbia to study civil contempt law and procedures in District of Columbia courts and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to study civil contempt laws and procedures in Federal courts. Requires reports on such studies by September 1, 1990. Makes this Act applicable to persons imprisoned during the 18-month period beginning on the date of this Act's enactment."
