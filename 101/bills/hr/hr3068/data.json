Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to repeal rule XLIX relating to the establishment of a statutory limit on the public debt. Title II: Restriction on Use of Continuing Appropriations - Amends rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the consideration of a bill or joint resolution making appropriations under the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee of the Committee of Appropriations which applies to more than 30 calendar days during a fiscal year. Allows the waiver or suspension of such rule by a vote of three-fifths of the Members present. Title III: Spending Control - Adds a title to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to authorize the President to rescind all or part of any budget authority provided in an appropriations bill by notifying the Congress of the rescission by a special message within ten calendar days after enactment of the Act in question. Effects any such rescission unless the Congress, within ten days after receiving the special message, completes action on a bill disapproving the proposal. Describes: (1) information to be included in the President's message; and (2) procedures to govern consideration of rescission disapproval legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
