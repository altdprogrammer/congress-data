Requires the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the International Trade Administration, to submit to the Congress a five-year export market efficiency strategy. Requires the Secretary, in developing such strategy, to consider the best means to: (1) eliminate duplicative export promotion activities by the Department; and (2) improve and increase information and assistance to U.S. firms, particularly small-and medium-size firms, that export their products overseas. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the export market efficiency strategy, including (in the first report) consideration of the best means to establish within the United States and Foreign Commercial Service a one-stop shop which would: (1) make information on export services from U.S. agencies available to exporters; and (2) coordinate Federal, State, local, and regional export activities with not-for-profit groups and trade associations involved in promoting exports."
