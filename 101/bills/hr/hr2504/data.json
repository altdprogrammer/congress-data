    "text": "Great Lakes Maritime Trade Act of 1989 - Title I: Eligibility of Certain Reflagged Vessels in the Great Lakes to Carry Preference Cargoes - Exempts an American Great Lakes vessel (AGLV) from provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 which prohibit a vessel which is built or rebuilt outside the United States or documented under any foreign registry from being, for purposes of cargo preference provisions, a privately owned U.S.-flag vessel. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to designate a vessel to be an AGLV if it meets certain requirements regarding U.S. documentation and if the owner enters into a construction and purchase agreement specifying that: (1) all repair, maintenance, reconditioning, and other construction (except emergency repairs) shall be performed in the United States; and (2) if the designation is revoked or terminated under provisions of this Act, the United States shall have an exclusive right to purchase the vessel under specified price terms. Declares that, notwithstanding any law, if the United States does not purchase the vessel, the owner shall not be prohibited from transferring the vessel to a foreign registry or selling it to a non-U.S. citizen. Prohibits an AGLV, except during the Great Lakes shipping off-season, from engaging in trade: (1) from a non-Great Lakes U.S. port; (2) between U.S. ports; or (3) between Great Lakes U.S. ports and Great Lakes Canadian ports. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to revoke the designation of a vessel as an AGLV on determining that the vessel does not meet a requirement for the designation, it has been operated in violation of this title, or the owner has violated a construction and purchase agreement under this title. Terminates an AGLV designation three years after the date of the designation or on an earlier date as may be requested by the vessel owner. Title II: Great Lakes Maritime Passage Enhancements - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to extend indefinitely, with regard to certain cargo preference provisions, the requirement that the Secretary of Transportation take steps to preserve the percentage share, or metric tonnage of bagged, processed, or fortified commodities experienced in calendar year 1984, of waterborne cargoes exported from Great Lakes ports pursuant to specified provisions of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Directs the Secretary of the Army, notwithstanding specified requirements of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, to initiate and complete the design, planning, and engineering of the Sault Sainte Marie lock project. Extends the authorization of such project to the end of FY 1993. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) initiate discussions with Canada to eliminate all tolls on the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway; and (2) report to the Congress, by January 1, 1990, regarding those efforts, any results, and recommendations for further action. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that: (1) funding for icebreaking capability in the Great Lakes should be maintained at a level sufficient to ensure passage under any conditions which may reasonably be expected to occur during the Great Lakes shipping season; and (2) it is essential to maintain in the Great Lakes an icebreaking vessel with horsepower and beam equivalent to those of the Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw."
