Requires grantees to: (1) set aside 50 percent of the grant to make grants to community-based programs for carrying out the same purposes; (2) establish a comprehensive program of identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes or related complications and providing such individuals with education and counseling with respect to receiving preventive health care; and (3) provide information and services in the language and cultural context most appropriate for the individuals for whom the information and services are intended. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to block grants to state that allotments under certain provisions for preventive health services may be used for services relating to the prevention of diabetes and related complications among populations at risk for diabetes."
