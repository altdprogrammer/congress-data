States that U.S. policy toward China should: (1) be guided by the progress toward democratic political reform in China and Tibet; and (2) take into account the extent to which China has ceased missile sales to the Middle East, is respecting its public assurances regarding opposition to chemical and biological weapons, is cooperating to reach a negotiated settlement to the Cambodian conflict, and is ceasing repressive measures against Tibet and working to enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama concerning Tibet's status. Requests the President to report to the Congress on human rights and democratic political reform in China and on Chinese cooperation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts."
