Urges such Government to extend to all people in Haiti rights guaranteed in relevant human rights accords and to undertake efforts to restore confidence in the electoral process. Calls upon the Secretary of State to: (1) make free and fair elections, a democratic transition, and respect for human rights key issues in determining U.S. relations with Haitian authorities; (2) urge such Government to guarantee the safe return of exiled opposition leaders, provide security to candidates, permit a resumption of political activity by parties and candidates, and assure voter safety; (3) call attention to the state of siege and ongoing human rights violations by such Government in international fora; (4) cooperate with other governments in multilateral appeals and bilateral actions to focus world attention on the situation in Haiti, to promote protection of the Haitian people, and to underscore the consequences of the failure of the Haitian Government to meet engagements for credible elections; and (5) conduct a review of U.S. policy to consider further bilateral, multilateral, economic, and political measures to assure the success of free and fair elections in Haiti."
