Expresses the deep regret of the Congress on behalf of the United States to the descendants of the victims, survivors, and their respective tribal communities. Commends the efforts of reconciliation initiated by the State of South Dakota and the Wounded Knee Survivors Association. Expresses the support of the Congress for the establishment of a suitable Memorial to those slain at Wounded Knee which could inform the American public of the historic significance of the events and accurately portray the heroic and courageous campaign waged by the Sioux people to preserve and protect their lands and their way of life during this period. Expresses the commitment of the Congress to acknowledge and learn from our history, including the Wounded Knee Massacre, in order to provide a proper foundation for building an ever more humane, enlightened, and just society for the future."
