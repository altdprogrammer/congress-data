Welcomes: (1) statements by Nepali leaders calling for investigations of the killings and other mistreatment of demonstrators, and for compensation for victims; (2) the decision of the King of Nepal to legalize political parties and endorse a process of political reform; and (3) the statement of the Nepali Government that it will release all persons imprisoned for the exercise of their religious beliefs. Urges: (1) all individuals and groups in Nepal to work peacefully toward the establishment of a political system that guarantees internationally recognized human rights, including the rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly, and the right of the Nepali people to choose their leaders by free and fair elections; and (2) the Nepali Government to ensure that no Nepalese citizen is punished for exercising religious rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
