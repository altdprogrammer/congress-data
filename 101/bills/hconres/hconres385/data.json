Urges the Governments of the Republics of Slovenia and Croatia to meet their financial commitments to Kosovo and to remain engaged in working to resolve Kosovo's grave economic conditions. Commends the Yugoslav Government and Prime Minister Markovic for efforts to mediate between the Slavic minorities and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, for condemning violence, and pledging to investigate all human rights abuses. Urges the Federal Government and the Prime Minister to increase efforts to reestablish a constructive dialogue. Requests the President to express, to the highest levels of the Yugoslav Government, congressional concerns about the situation in Kosovo."
