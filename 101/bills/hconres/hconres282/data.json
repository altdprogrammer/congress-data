Commends: (1) President de Klerk for the release of Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of the African National Congress; and (2) Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and others for their perseverance in the struggle for a nonracial democracy. Urges de Klerk to initiate the dismantling of apartheid, move rapidly to meet the conditions necessary for the opening of negotiations, and meet the terms of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 for the relaxation of sanctions. Supports: (1) the maintenance of sanctions against the South African Government until conditions under such Act for the suspension, modification, or termination of sanctions have been met; and (2) assistance to the victims of apartheid as an important and necessary complement to U.S. sanctions."
