Urges the Government of Iraq to: (1) allow international relief personnel access to the Kurdish inhabited areas of northern Iraq; and (2) extend to all people in Iraq certain fundamental rights. Calls upon the Secretary of State to: (1) encourage the Government of Iraq to implement human rights reforms; (2) call attention to human rights violations in international fora; (3) cooperate with other governments to focus attention on the situation in Iraq; and (4) provide, and urge others to provide, refugee and humanitarian assistance for those Kurds who have been forced to flee their homeland."
