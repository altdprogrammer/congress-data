    "text": "Declares that the United States should: (1) agree that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is to proceed with mandatory repatriation of non-refugee Vietnamese asylum seekers, provided that the Commissioner upholds the integrity of the screening program and guarantees that safeguards for the protection and well-being of the returnees exist; (2) reserve the right to insist that mandatory repatriation be a choice of last resort and that it occur only if safeguards are in place; (3) not try to impede an orderly repatriation plan if there is in place in each first asylum country a credible screening program for determining refugee status and that asylum seekers are apprised of their rights and options; (4) not try to proscribe orderly repatriation as a remedy, provided that efforts have been made to exhaust lists of those who would return voluntarily and that involuntary repatriation is planned as carefully as possible; (5) accede to orderly repatriation if Vietnam gives specified assurances concerning the treatment and rights of returnees; and (6) adhere to commitments to resettle substantial numbers of eligible refugees. States that conciliation on such matters does not lessen revulsion for the harm done by Malaysia and Hong Kong and U.S. resolve to find sanctions if there is not a cessation of boat \"pushbacks\" and checks on other cruelty within refugee camps."
