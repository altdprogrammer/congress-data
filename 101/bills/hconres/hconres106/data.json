Sets forth the levels of budget authority, budget outlays, new direct loan obligations, new primary loan guarantee commitments, and new secondary loan guarantee commitments for each major functional category for FY 1990 through 1992. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Congress shall present the revenue and the spending reduction provisions of the reconciliation bill to the President concurrently; and (2) specific measures governing the governmental receipts figure will be determined through the regular processes, with any revenue legislation reconciled in accordance with the agreement between the executive branch, the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Committee on Finance to be advanced legislatively when supported by the President. Requires the following Senate Committees to report to the Senate Committee on the Budget by July 15, 1989, changes in laws within their respective jurisdictions that are sufficient to increase contributions and reduce budget authority and outlays by specified amounts in FY 1990: (1) Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; (2) Committee on Banking, Housing, Urban Affairs; (3) Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; (4) Committee on Environment and Public Works; (5) Committee on Finance; (6) Committee on Governmental Affairs; (7) Committee on Labor and Human Resources; and (8) Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

Directs the Budget Committees to report to the House and Senate reconciliation legislation implementing the recommended changes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets to nongovernment buyers; and (2) the amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. Assumes deficit-neutral adjustments (contingent on legislation to make funds available) of allocations to: (1) the Senate Committee on Finance for increased funding for children and for increased Medicaid funding; and (2) the House Ways and Means Committee for increased funding for children. Expresses the sense of the Senate that if the relevant committee of the House of Representatives recommends legislation to provide for increased Medicaid funding, the Senate shall adopt revised reconciliation instructions to incorporate Medicaid increases reflected in this resolution."
