    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should direct the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to: (1) seek to discontinue current negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regarding the extension of intellectual property rights protection to items or processes with biological and genetic content, including crop varieties, until a specified assessment (pursuant to this Resolution) concerning such rights has been completed; or (2) if such discontinuance is unsuccessful, to ensure that any resultant trade agreement concerning such intellectual property rights will be nonbinding in the areas of biological and genetic resources. Urges the President to direct the USTR to assess the economic and political ramifications of creating trade policies for intellectual property rights for such resources, including analysis of property rights ownership and for prior cultural traditional uses of items with biological or genetic content where a party may be: (1) a tribal minority; (2) indigenous to a geographical area; (3) unacculturated in the national society; (4) nonliterate, nonmonetized or partially monetized; or (5) without national representation."
