Directs the committee to report its proposed program to both Houses within 180 days after they have agreed to this resolution. Requires such report to present the program in the form of recommended amendments to the Rules of the House of Representatives and the Standing Rules of the Senate. Deems such recommended amendments to be agreed to by both Houses 30 legislative days after the committee reports, except to the extent that such amendments are rejected by either House. Terminates the committee 30 days after the submission of its report."
