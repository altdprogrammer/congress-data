Calls upon: (1) all nations to withhold foreign assistance from such Government until a democratically elected government assumes office; and (2) the President, the Secretary of State, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and the U.S. Ambassador to Burma to condemn publicly the repression in Burma and encourage free and fair elections and the provision of international observers for such elections."
