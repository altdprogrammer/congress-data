Endorses the proposal for an enhanced United Nations (UN) role in Cambodia, including a UN-supervised interim administration and an international peacekeeping force. Urges the President to continue to pursue an international consensus regarding such proposal. Declares that: (1) the support of the Governments of the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam for the concept of a UN-supervised interim administration and their active cooperation in facilitating an agreement will contribute to improved relations between such countries and the United States; and (2) the establishment of such an interim administration would reflect a new spirit of cooperation and serve as a model for future Security Council peacekeeping efforts."
