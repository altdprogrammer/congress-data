    "text": "Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives favoring a modified budget freeze in FY 1990 as an equitable way of complying with the deficit reduction targets of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Calls for a freeze at FY 1989 levels of FY 1990 discretionary budget authority levels and aggregate Federal discretionary defense and nondefense spending. Lists as basic to a modified freeze the suspension of FY 1990: (1) Federal civilian and military pay increases; (2) farm price support increases; and (3) Medicare and Medicaid price inflation reimbursements. Exempts from the freeze any payments of interest for the national debt and entitlement coverage (except Medicare) for new program entrants."
