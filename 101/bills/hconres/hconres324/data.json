    "text": "Calls upon the Government of Burma (now known as Myanmar) to: (1) create the conditions necessary to ensure free and fair elections in Burma on May 27, 1990, by releasing persons imprisoned for the peaceful expression of their views, permitting all Burmese citizens committed to peaceful participation in the political process an opportunity to contest elections, lifting electoral campaign restrictions that provide the authorities with nearly unlimited power to limit debate, establishing an impartial election commission, and permitting access to Burma for international election observers; and (2) demonstrate a commitment to human rights by abandoning martial law restrictions on the right to a fair trial, ending rape, torture, extrajudicial executions, and forced porterage of civilians, and ordering investigations and pursuing prosecutions against those believed responsible. Calls upon: (1) the international community to withhold foreign assistance from, and to end all military cooperation (including arms sales) with, such Government; and (2) the President to discourage other countries from providing such assistance and cooperation and to encourage international observation of the election process. Denounces the Burmese Government's practice of accommodation and cooperation with drug traffickers. Welcomes Administration statements that it has no present intention of resuming narcotics control assistance to Burma. Declares unwillingness to support narcotics control measures in Burma which could indicate a lessening of U.S. support for democratic evolution and improvement of human rights and which measures are not appropriately monitored and do not effectively reduce illicit narcotics production and trafficking. Urges the President to: (1) pressure such Government to cease its practice of accommodation with drug traffickers and pursue more vigorous antinarcotics policies; (2) focus international scrutiny on Burma's antinarcotics record; and (3) encourage such Government to adhere to all international antinarcotics agreements and to cooperate with relevant international agencies."
