    "text": "War Powers Reform Amendments Resolution of 1989 - Amends the War Powers Resolution to remove the requirement that the President consult regularly with the Congress during the involvement in hostilities of U.S. armed forces. Revises reporting requirements for the President for the introduction of such forces in the absence of a declaration of war. Removes the requirement of a semiannual report on the status of hostilities. Requires the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate, if petitioned by at least 50 percent (currently, 30 percent) of the membership of their respective Houses, to request the President to convene the Congress in order to consider any presidential report on U.S. armed forces involved in hostilities. Repeals a provision requiring the withdrawal of such forces after a certain period of time. Provides for the removal of such forces, in the absence of a declaration of war, if the Congress so directs by joint (currently, concurrent) resolution. Makes a joint resolution subject to priority procedures only if it is sponsored by at least 50 percent of the membership of the House in which it was introduced. Repeals current priority procedures for joint resolutions or bills and makes priority procedures applicable to concurrent resolutions applicable only to joint resolutions. Repeals specified provisions concerning the interpretation of the War Powers Resolution."
