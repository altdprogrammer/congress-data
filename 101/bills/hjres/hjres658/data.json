Declares that the United States and the international community must continue to oppose Iraq's armed aggression against Kuwait. States that the United States and the international community should: (1) continue to condemn Iraq for aggression and specified human rights and terrorist offenses; and (2) hold Iraq and its leaders accountable for such actions. Supports the deployment of U.S. armed forces to the Persian Gulf region and expresses appreciation to such forces. Commends the President for his efforts to promote international consensus and cooperation in response to the Persian Gulf crisis. Declares that the United States should continue to: (1) strengthen the international consensus against Iraq's aggression; (2) obtain additional military forces and increased financial assistance from other nations in support of multinational forces deployed in the Persian Gulf; and (3) obtain international assistance for nations that have suffered financial losses as a result of support for the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq and international humanitarian assistance for foreign nationals who have fled Iraq and Kuwait. States that the United States should continue to: (1) seek international consensus to contain Iraq's conventional, chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and stop the export to Iraq of dual use technology and military components; (2) seek international consensus to address regional problems of arms proliferation and ensure that conventional weapons transfers to the region reflect legitimate security needs of the recipient nation; (3) maintain Israel's economic well-being and military advantage in the Middle East and achieve an Arab-Israeli peace settlement; and (4) promote respect for human rights and support the development of democratic institutions throughout such region. Commends the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council for their response to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait. Affirms support for specified United Nations Security Council resolutions and calls on all nations to comply with such resolutions and strengthen sanctions against Iraq. Declares that the United States and other members of the international community should continue efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
