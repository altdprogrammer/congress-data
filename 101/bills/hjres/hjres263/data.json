Requires: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to direct the United States Executive Directors of the multilateral development banks to increase the emphasis those banks place on nonmotorized, low cost, and energy efficient alternatives to private motor vehicles; (2) the Director of the Peace Corps to encourage the use of nonmotorized transportation technologies in its projects and by its volunteers; and (3) the President to submit a report to the Congress, within one year, concerning the implementation of this Act."
