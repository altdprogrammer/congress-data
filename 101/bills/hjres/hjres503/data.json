Directs the President to instruct the U.S. executive directors of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to oppose any form of economic or technical assistance to China. Makes the above provisions applicable until the President submits a report to the Congress that the Chinese Government has made progress on a program of political reform throughout the country, including Tibet, and that it is in the U.S. national security interest to terminate such provisions."
