Declares that, upon Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungarian territory (scheduled for June 1991), Hungary will have regained its freedom from Soviet influence and should no longer be considered a socialist, one-party state, but a representative democracy."
