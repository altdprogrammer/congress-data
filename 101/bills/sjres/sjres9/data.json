Directs the President to submit to the Congress prior to each fiscal year a proposed budget that meets this standard. Permits any bill for raising taxes to become law only if a majority of the whole number of both Houses of Congress approves it by roll call vote. Authorizes a waiver of these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect."
