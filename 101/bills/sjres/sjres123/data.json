Requires, as a prerequisite to coproduction, that the United States and Japan sign a memorandum of understanding containing the terms and conditions for such coproduction. Urges that such Memorandum specify that the U.S. share shall not be less than 40 percent of the total value of the coproduction, including the value of manufacturing spare parts and other support items which are part of the lifetime maintenance costs of such weapons system. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to submit semiannual reports to specified congressional officials, describing the progress made in implementing the November 29, 1988, Memorandum of Understanding between the United States Department of Defense and the Japan Defense Agency on Cooperation in the Development of the FS-X Weapon System."
