    "text": "Collective Security in the Persian Gulf Resolution - Declares the intent of the Congress that this Act shall constitute specific statutory authorization for continued U.S. military participation in collective security actions in the Persian Gulf region. Sets forth the immediate goals (unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of sovereignty to Kuwait, and the protection of the lives of American citizens held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait) and the long-term goals (security and stability of the region and the promotion of a new world order by unprecedented and effective use of the mechanisms of collective security action) and the principles (collective responsibility, emphasis on the United Nations, promotion of adequately shared responsibilities among countries with interests in the region, and compliance with international law) of U.S. policy in the region. Requires the United States to seek effective multilateral participation in such restrictions on trade with the Government of Iraq as are necessary to ensure a cessation of transfers to that regime of military technology and equipment, including all material and technical assistance that could contribute to the development or employment of ballistic missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Authorizes the President to use U.S. armed forces in hostilities in the region: (1) for purposes of U.S. participation in collective security actions to implement specified U.N. Security Council resolutions intended to restore the sovereignty of Kuwait or to deter and defend against further Iraqi aggression; and (2) to respond to any acts of intended harm to American citizens or nationals. Requires the President, in the event of significant hostilities in the region which involve or may involve U.S. armed forces, to: (1) seek a declaration of war of other statutory authorization in accordance with this Act; and (2) request funds from the Congress to carry out such declaration or authorization. Directs the Congress to periodically consider further measures of authorization and appropriation in light of further developments. Requires the President to submit periodic reports to specified congressional officials providing a detailed description of the continuing U.S. participation in collective security actions in the region, the circumstances requiring the continuation of such participation, and the results of U.S. efforts undertaken in accordance with the goals set forth in this Act. Establishes Senate and House Leadership Groups to facilitate deliberation and executive-legislative consultation on critical decisions relating to U.S. participation in collective security actions pursuant to this Act. Sets forth provisions with respect to the composition of such groups and combined meetings. Requires the President, in the event of developments in the region that involve or appear likely to involve U.S. armed forces in hostilities, to consult fully and promptly with the Senate and House Leadership Groups on the circumstances and the implications thereof. Requires the President, unless urgent circumstances do not permit, to consult with and seek advice from the Congressional Leadership Groups or a Combined Congressional Leadership Group before committing U.S. armed forces to hostilities in the region and, in any event, to consult with and seek advice from such Groups within 24 hours after hostilities occur regardless of urgent conditions. Sets forth congressional priority procedures and time limits for joint resolutions which: (1) declare war and make appropriations as necessary to support such war; (2) provide specific authorization for the use of U.S. armed forces and make appropriations for such use; and (3) order the withdrawal of such troops. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated or otherwise available for any activity which would have the purpose or effect of violating any provision of law enacted pursuant to this Act. Terminates funding on or after 30 days after such a joint resolution is submitted if the Congress has not enacted a specific authorization for the use of U.S. armed forces in hostilities."
