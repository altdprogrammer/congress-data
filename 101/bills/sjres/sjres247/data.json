Repeals provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Appropriations Act, 1990: (1) requiring a presidential certification of conditions that must be met, such as progress in assuring civilian control of the armed forces, before Panama may receive U.S. assistance; and (2) banning the import of sugar products from Panama without a presidential certification of constitutional guarantees to the Panamanian people."
