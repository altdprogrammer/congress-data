    "as": "Reported to House amended", 
    "date": "1989-05-31", 
    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that if the United States and Japan seek to coproduce the FSX aircraft, the President, in negotiating the coproduction memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Japan, should secure provisions that would: (1) prohibit the transfer to Japan of critical engine technologies, including, but not limited to, hot section and digital fuel control technologies; and (2) provide a U.S. share of the total production value of the coproduction of not less than 40 percent, including the value of manufacturing spare parts and other support items of such aircraft system. Conditions U.S. cooperation with Japan in the codevelopment of the FSX aircraft on the requirement that no technical data, defense service, or defense article valued at $50,000,000 or more nor any major defense equipment valued at $14,000,000 or more developed from U.S. technology may be transferred to a third country without prior congressional approval. Requires the Comptroller General, beginning six months after enactment of this Act and every 12 months thereafter, to submit to the Congress a report specifying certain information and describing the progress made in implementing the FSX Codevelopment MOU and related documents. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to review the MOU or related agreement, and recommend action to the President, if he or she determines that such agreement or its implementation do not serve U.S. strategic commercial interests. Prohibits the implementation of the MOU if the President determines that it is likely to have an adverse impact on the international competitive position of U.S. industry outweighing the benefits of entering into it."
