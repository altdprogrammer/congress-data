    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Establishes the Judicial Inquiry Commission to conduct investigations and receive or initiate complaints concerning any judge of the judicial system. Directs the Commission to file a complaint with the Court of the Judiciary if five of the seven Commission members decide that a reasonable basis exists to charge: (1) a judge with violation of any canon of judicial ethics, misconduct in office, or failure to perform duties; or (2) that a judge is physically or mentally unable to perform duties. Requires: (1) all proceedings of the Commission to be confidential (except the filing of a complaint); and (2) the Commission to prosecute the complaints. Requires the Supreme Court to adopt canons of ethics binding on all justices, judges, bankruptcy judges, and magistrates. Creates a Court of the Judiciary with the authority to adjudicate cases brought before it to remove from office and: (1) suspend for up to two years, with or without pay, or censure any judge for misconduct in office or failure to perform the duties of office; or (2) suspend with pay, or place on senior status, any judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of office. Sets forth provisions with respect to Supreme Court review of appeals of Court of the Judiciary decisions, disqualification from service pending an indictment or information charging a judge with a felony, and termination of salary if a judge is convicted or suspended."
