    "text": "Collective Security in the Persian Gulf Resolution - Sets forth the immediate goals (unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of sovereignty to Kuwait, and the protection of the lives of American citizens held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait) and the long-term goals (security and stability of the region and the promotion of a new world order by unprecedented and effective use of the mechanisms of collective security action) of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf region. Authorizes the President to use U.S. armed forces in hostilities in the region: (1) for purposes of U.S. participation in collective security actions to implement specified U.N. Security Council resolutions intended to restore the sovereignty of Kuwait or to deter and defend against further Iraqi aggression; and (2) to respond to any acts of intended harm to American citizens or nationals. Directs the United States to continue to emphasize and: (1) take all necessary steps to secure adequate sharing by countries of the region and of the industrialized world of the responsibilities associated with collective security actions in the region, including the costs of military deployments and participation in economic sanctions; and (2) rely upon the procedures and instrumentalities of the United Nations system to sustain effective multilateral support for such actions. Requires the President to submit periodic reports to specified congressional officials providing a detailed description of the continuing U.S. participation in collective security actions in the region, the circumstances requiring the continuation of such participation, and the results of U.S. efforts undertaken in accordance with the goals set forth in this Act. Establishes Senate and House Leadership Groups to facilitate deliberation and executive-legislative consultation on critical decisions relating to U.S. participation in collective security actions pursuant to this Act. Sets forth provisions with respect to the composition of such groups and combined meetings. Requires the President, unless urgent circumstances do not permit, to consult with and seek advice from the Congressional Leadership Groups or a Combined Congressional Leadership Group regarding developments in the involvement of U.S. armed forces in hostilities in the region. Sets forth congressional priority procedures for congressional actions on joint resolutions requiring the President to disengage forces from hostilities within a specified number of days. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated or otherwise available for any activity which would have the purpose or effect of violating any provision of law enacted pursuant to this Act."
