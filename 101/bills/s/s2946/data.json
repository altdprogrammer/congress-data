    "text": "Transplant Amendments Act of 1990 - Title I: National Bone Marrow Donor Registry - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, by contract, to establish and maintain a National Bone Marrow Donor Registry to take specified actions, including: (1) establish a system for finding donors; (2) establish a system of patient advocacy separate from mechanisms for donor advocacy; and (3) increase the representation of racial and ethnic minority groups in the potential donor pool. Provides for confidentiality of records, establishing criminal monetary and imprisonment penalties for violations. Authorizes appropriations. Removes provisions directing the Secretary, by grant or contract, to establish a bone marrow registry. Title II: Organ Transplants - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, qualified organ procurement organizations and other nonprofit entities for special projects to increase the number of organ donors. (Current law authorizes the Secretary to make grants for the same purpose but makes no reference to contracts or to the recipients of the grants or the contractees.) Removes provisions specifying matters the Secretary must consider in making grants. Replaces a requirement that an organ procurement organization (OPO) be of sufficient size to expect to procure organs from at least 50 donors a year with provisions requiring that an OPO be of sufficient size to assure maximum effectiveness in the procurement and equitable distribution of organs. Repeals provisions of the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 specifying the effective date of related provisions with regard to certain OPOs. Replaces provisions prohibiting the Network from being engaged in any activity unrelated to organ procurement with provisions requiring that the Network be an entity with expertise in organ procurement and transplantation. Modifies requirements regarding the composition of the Network's board of directors and the responsibilities of the Network. Removes provisions specifying special considerations and priorities the Secretary must apply in considering grant applications. Allows special project grants to be made for three (currently, two) years. Removes provisions limiting them to a maximum dollar amount. Adds references to contracts to provisions relating to the amount of the grant or contract, advance payments, recordkeeping, and audits. Removes the time limit on the requirement that the Secretary maintain an identifiable administrative unit in the Public Health Service relating to organ procurement and donation. Modifies the duties of the unit. Modifies requirements regarding a report by the Secretary on the status of organ transplantation. Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to organ transplants. Title III: Severability - Declares that if any portion of this Act is declared unconstitutional the remainder of the Act shall not be affected."
