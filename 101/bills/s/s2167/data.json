    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-11", 
    "text": "Amends the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 to: (1) authorize appropriations for grants to tribally-controlled community colleges and technical assistance contracts at the current fixed level for FY 1991 and at such sums as necessary for FY 1992; (2) authorize appropriations for the renovation and construction of Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities for use by such colleges at current levels for FY 1991 and 1992; (3) authorize appropriations for the Tribally-Controlled Community College Endowment Program (the Program) at the current fixed level for FY 1991 and at twice that amount for FY 1992; (4) increase the maximum allowable Federal contribution to the Program to $750,000; and (5) double the amount contributed by the Government for each amount raised by such a college. Revises formulae for determining the amounts of such grants and for adjusting such amounts for allocation among eligible applicants because of insufficient funding to require such determination and allocation to be based upon the Indian student count of the current year. Requires payments for such grants of not less than 95 percent of the funds available for allotment by October 15 or no later than 14 days after appropriations become available, with a payment equal to the remainder of any grant to which a grantee is entitled to be made no later than January 1 of each fiscal year. Requires initial allocations equal to 95 percent of an applicant's grant payment. Prohibits grants to establish an endowment trust fund for the Program unless such a college enters into an agreement with the Secretary of the Interior which: (1) provides for the deposit of a capital contribution by the college in an amount or of a value equal to half of each Federal contribution; and (2) provides that if the college withdraws any of its capital contributions, an amount of Federal contributions equal to twice the amount or value of such withdrawal shall be withdrawn. Authorizes real or personal property contributed to such a college to qualify for Federal matching funds for deposit in the endowment trust fund. Amends the Navajo Community College Act to authorize appropriations for construction grants for the Navajo Community Colleges for FY 1991 and 1992. Directs the College to submit an inventory of repairs, alterations, and renovations to facilities required to meet health and safety standards for review by the Secretary for submission, with Department comments, to appropriate congressional committees. Native American Languages Act - States that it is U.S. policy to: (1) promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages; (2) allow exceptions to teacher certification requirements for Federal or federally funded programs for instruction in such languages when such requirements hinder employment of qualified Native American language teachers and to encourage State and territorial governments to make similar exceptions; (3) encourage and support the use of such languages as a medium of educational instruction; (4) encourage State and local education programs to work with Native American parents, educators and governing bodies to implement programs to put this policy into effect; (5) recognize the right of such bodies to use such languages as a medium of instruction in all schools funded by the Secretary of the Interior; (6) recognize the right of such bodies, States, and U.S. territories and possessions to take action on, and give official status to, their Native American languages for purposes of conducting their own business; and (7) encourage all appropriate institutions of elementary, secondary, and higher education to include such languages in their curricula and to grant the same full academic credit for competency in such languages as for foreign languages to fulfill foreign language entrance or degree requirements. Declares that the right of Native Americans to express themselves through their languages shall not be restricted in any public proceeding, including publicly supported education programs. Directs the President to direct Federal agency heads to: (1) evaluate their policies and procedures to determine and implement changes needed to bring them into compliance with this Act; and (2) evaluate the laws they administer and make recommendations to the President on amendments needed to bring such laws into compliance with this Act. Directs the President to report such recommendations to the Congress. Provides that this Act shall not be construed as precluding the use of Federal funds to teach English to Native Americans."
