Provides, with respect to employment and training assistance for dislocated workers, that an eligible dislocated worker participating in training (except on-the-job training) shall be deemed to be in training with the approval of the State agency for purposes of unemployment compensation. Raises from ten to 20 percent the percentage of Job Corps participants who may be in the non-residential program.
