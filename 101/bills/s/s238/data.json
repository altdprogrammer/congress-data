    "text": "Chemical and Biological Warfare Prevention Act of 1989 - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to require the President to prepare a list of materials and technology which would assist a country's chemical or biological warfare capability. Prohibits the export of such materials and technology to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, or certain other countries. Requires the President, every 90 days, to submit to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report on: (1) the efforts by Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and certain other countries to acquire the materials to produce chemical or biological weapons; (2) the present and future capability of such countries to produce such weapons; and (3) whether Communist-bloc or non-Communist countries have aided such countries. Directs the President to apply specified sanctions to any U.S. or foreign person, with certain exceptions, who exports any item on the list to any such country. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties. Provides for the suspension of patents for chemical agents or production equipment produced by a sanctioned person."
