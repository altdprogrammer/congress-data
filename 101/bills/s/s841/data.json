Confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Atmospheric Nuclear Testing Compensation Trust Fund Board of Directors to process personal injury claims and payments. Subjects any findings and awards made by the Board to judicial review. Prescribes guidelines for Board determination of compassionate claims relating to open air nuclear testing and uranium mining in specified areas. Sets forth a statute of limitations for filing claims and restricts the amount of attorney's fees which may be received. Insulates the award of damages from insurance claims or payments. Declares the Federal Tort Claims Act inapplicable to radiation compensation actions and imposes liability upon the United States regarding such claims to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances."
