    "text": "Rural Business Link Promotion Act of 1989 - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a program, to be administered by the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), to assist rural businesses through the establishment of shared business communications or computer centers to make available to small business or individuals advanced telecommunications facilities or equipment, computer services or equipment, and telecommunications equipment at reduced costs. Prohibits funds from being made available for telecommunications facilities if: (1) a local exchange carrier providing telephone service agrees to provide small businesses or individuals with access to such telecommunications facilities as requested by such a business or individual; and (2) the local exchange carrier actually provides such access within a specified period of time after receiving the request of by such business or individual. Provides exceptions to such prohibition. Directs the REA to establish and implement procedures to assure that requests for loans and advances of funds to local exchange carriers providing telephone service and attempting to provide such small businesses and individuals with such telecommunications capabilities receive expedited consideration and determination. Requires the REA to notify businesses located in rural areas of the program available under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994. Directs the Secretary to establish, within the National Agricultural Library, a National Rural Information Center Clearinghouse to distribute information and data to any industry, organization, or Federal, State, or local government entity about programs and services provided for eligible businesses and individuals in a rural area, including job training, education, health care, and economic development assistance, as well as emotional and financial counseling. Requires all Federal agencies, State and local agencies, and nonprofit organizations to provide the Clearinghouse with all required and necessary information upon request by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations for the Clearinghouse for FY 1990 through 1994. Amends the Rural Development Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary to establish a program, to be operated in conjunction with the Clearinghouse, to provide information to local rural communities and other rural areas concerning rural development matters and the availability of Federal rural development assistance. Authorizes appropriations."
