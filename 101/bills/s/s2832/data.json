States that Congress does not intend that the wilderness designation will lead to the creation of protective buffer zones around it. Expresses congressional findings regarding agreements on wilderness and timber supplies in the area. Requires that nondesignated lands be managed for multiple use, stating that those lands need not be managed for the purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness designation prior to revision of the initial land and resource management plans. Authorizes appropriations."
