    "text": "Title I: Acquisition Workforce - Requires, within two years after the enactment of this Act, demonstration programs using alternative compensation systems to be implemented by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and: (1) the head of the National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or General Accounting Office; (2) the Secretary of Defense; or (3) the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, whichever is appropriate. Requires no less than six and no more than ten demonstration projects to be conducted using such alternative compensation systems. Outlines administrative provisions concerning the number of programs to be undertaken by each official and the number of employees to participate in each program, and action to be taken if a demonstration program involves a collective bargaining system. Requires OPM, the Secretary, and the Administrator, with respect to each demonstration project conducted, to develop and publish in the Federal Register an information gathering plan with regard to such alternative compensation system demonstrated, and to notify affected employees and the Congress at least 90 days before implementation of such system. Provides for termination of each demonstration program. Outlines conditions under which the Secretary, the Administrator, or an agency head may permanently implement an alternative personnel compensation system previously demonstrated. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the rates of pay for up to 500 positions designated by the Secretary as critical. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to govern discussions of future employment opportunities of procurement officials of the Department of Defense (DOD) (post-employment restrictions). Outlines provisions concerning: (1) authorized discussions of possible future employment opportunities with a competing contractor by a covered procurement official; and (2) the request of advice by an employee or former employee of DOD from the appropriate designated agency ethics official as to whether such employee or former employee is precluded from participating in the performance of a particular contract on behalf of a particular contractor or subcontractor. Authorizes the Secretary to waive a certain prohibition against the receipt of dual compensation for not more than 1,000 DOD employees who are in scientific, engineering, professorial, or management positions designated as critical positions by the Secretary. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary should take all necessary actions to promote and encourage, at all educational levels, an increase in the number of U.S. citizens and nationals who pursue courses of study in science, engineering, and other technical disciplines. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the award of fellowships to U.S. citizens and nationals who agree to pursue graduate degrees in science, engineering, or other fields of study designated by the Secretary to be of priority interest to DOD. Outlines fellowship award conditions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991."
