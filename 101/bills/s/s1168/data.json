    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the income tax deduction for the amount of health insurance costs of a self-employed individual from 25 percent to 100 percent of such costs for the medical care of the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse and dependents. Permits an income tax deduction for self-employed individuals in the amount of their contributions to group health plans that are not self-insured and that provide medical benefits to employees. Requires: (1) an eligible plan to benefit all employees not covered by another group health plan: and (2) that at least half of the plan participants not be self-employed individuals or employee family members of such individuals. Excludes such group health plans from the rules governing (section 89) nondiscrimination requirements for coverage and benefits under certain statutory employee benefit plans. Includes in the gross income of any highly compensated employee the excess benefits provided under a discriminatory group health plan."
