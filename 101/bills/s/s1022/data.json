    "text": "Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1990 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission for FY 1990 and 1991. Makes funds available to the Commission for administrative expenses associated with the collection of fees. Earmarks specified FY 1991 Commission funds for upgrading and modernizing equipment at the Commission's electronic emissions test laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Authorizes the Commission to accept and employ the services of qualified persons to prepare and administer examinations for commercial radio operator licenses or endorsements. Authorizes the Commission to prescribe regulations to select, oversee, sanction, and dismiss such employees. Excepts such employees from consideration as Federal or special Government employees. Extends through: (1) FY 1992 the Commission's travel reimbursement program; and (2) FY 1991 the Commission's authorization to make grants or to enter into agreements to utilize the talents of older Americans in programs authorized by the Commission. Extends through FY 1992 the Commission's authorization to expend funds for the relocation within the State of Hawaii of the Hawaii Monitoring Station presently located in Honolulu. Amends the Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1988 to authorize the Administrator of General Services to dispose only to the State of Hawaii the property comprising such Station in order for such relocation to occur. Requires such sale and conveyance to occur on an expedited basis. Specifies terms and conditions of sale, including the payment of at least the fair market value of such property by Hawaii to the Administrator. Requires GSA to reimburse the Commission the net proceeds of such sale. Provides that, in the event the GSA and Hawaii are not able to execute a contract for such sale, the Administrator shall not proceed to public sale of such property. Requires the Station to continue full operations at its present location until a new facility is built and is fully operational. Increases to 120 days (currently, 90 days) the period of notice a common carrier is required to provide before implementing changes in the fees charged for wire or radio communications between different points within the carrier's system. Authorizes the use of multilateral (currently, only bilateral) agreements between the United States and an alien's government when allowing such alien the right to operate an amateur radio in both the United States and the countries privy to the multilateral or bilateral agreement. Prohibits the willful or malicious interference with any radio communication of any station licensed or authorized under the Communications Act of 1934 or operated by the Government. Excludes persons who are not applicants for certain licenses from the Commission from forfeiture penalty provisions in the case of rebates or offsets."
