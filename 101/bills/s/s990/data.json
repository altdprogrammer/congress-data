    "text": "Eliminates the use of the franking privilege for congressional newsletters. Authorizes a Member of, or Member-elect to, Congress to send as franked mail only such mass mailings: (1) which are in direct response to inquiries or requests from persons to whom the matter is mailed; (2) to colleagues in the Congress or to other Government officials; (3) of news releases to the communications media; (4) which consist of individually addressed responses on a specific issue to constituents; (5) which consist of news announcements on a specific issue individually addressed to the chief officer or any member of the board of directors of an organization with an interest in the specific issue; (6) which consist of materials not prepared by, or relating to, a Member of Congress; or (7) the sole purpose of which is to give notice of a town meeting and which is mailable as a postcard. Replaces the lump-sum appropriation to the legislative branch as the means for reimbursing the Postal Service for franked mailings with funds appropriated to each House of Congress for the costs of such mailings attributable to the respective bodies. Establishes separate official mail costs accounts for each House. (Under current law, there is a single congressional account.) Directs that each Member of each House receive an allocation from the amount appropriated for official mail. Requires that a Member pay for postage for franked mail in excess of the amount of such allocation. Provides for the printing of a compilation of the costs incurred as a result of the mass mailing, broken down by Member, in the Congressional Record."
