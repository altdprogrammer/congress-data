    "text": "Deceptive Mailings Prevention Act of 1989 - Amends Federal law to declare as nonmailable any mail matter which is designed to resemble a bill, invoice, or statement of account due, but which in fact constitutes a solicitation of donations. Requires such mail matter to bear on its face in conspicuous type that it is a solicitation of donations and that the addressee is under no obligation to make any payment. Declares as nonmailable any mail matter which constitutes a solicitation by a non-governmental entity and which contains a seal, insignia, term, or symbol which reasonably could be interpreted as implying Government connection, approval, or endorsement. Allows the mailing of such matter if it contains a conspicuous disclaimer that it is not a Government document. Sets forth procedures governing the handling of matter suspected of being nonmailable matter."
