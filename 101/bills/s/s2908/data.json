    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-08-04", 
    "text": "Military Personnel Transition Assistance Act of 1990 - Revises provisions concerning travel and transportation allowances for persons discharged or released from armed forces active duty to authorize (current law requires) such allowances even if such a member is not entitled to separation or readjustment pay. Provides an allowance for dependents and baggage and household goods for members who are involuntarily discharged or released from active duty or who are not accepted for an additional tour of duty. Authorizes the payment of separation pay for a regular enlisted member of the armed forces who is discharged involuntarily or as the result of a denial of reenlistment, who has completed five or more, but less than 20, years of active service, and who is serving on at least a second enlistment. Repeals certain current limitations on the amount of separation pay authorized. Directs the Secretary concerned to pay the premiums for health insurance provided on a voluntary basis to a member of the uniformed services upon discharge or release from active duty for the month in which such member is discharged or released and the six months after such release or discharge in the case of any member who is involuntarily discharged or released from active duty and who has completed two or more years of continuous service. Covers the member and his or her dependents. Covers preexisting health conditions for one year following such discharge or release. Provides an exception for coverage of premiums if the Secretary determines that conditions under which the person was discharged or released do not warrant such benefits. Terminates such authority after September 30, 1995. Provides eligibility for basic educational assistance under the armed forces or veterans' educational assistance programs for persons involuntarily discharged or released from active duty. Provides conditions and limitations to such program. Directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Veterans Affairs and the heads of other appropriate Federal departments and agencies, to conduct a program to furnish employment, education, and other information and services to members of the armed forces during the 180 days before such members are involuntarily separated from the armed forces. Requires such services to assist such members in assimilating to civilian life. Outlines services and activities to be provided under such program. Requires the Secretary, within the 180-day period prior to such discharge or release, to: (1) notify the member of the date of separation; and (2) brief such member on the availability of the benefits and services provided under the information program. Authorizes the Secretary to utilize disabled veterans' outreach program specialists, veterans' employment representatives, other employment services personnel, and representatives of veterans' services organizations to furnish the employment and training information and services under the program. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts to provide such program. Requires coordination of such program with similar veterans' programs. Provides that, in the preparation for discharge or release from active duty of members stationed outside the United States whose dependents accompanied them, the Secretary shall to the extent feasible reassign the member and dependents to the United States for the final three to six months of such member's tour of active duty. Urges and requests the President to establish a special committee to report to the Congress, the President, and the Secretary regarding effective and practical ways of encouraging civilian employers to cooperate with and assist the Government in providing employment training and job placement services to members being involuntarily discharged or released from the armed forces. Repeals current Federal law which: (1) prohibits a Federal employee from being entitled to unemployment compensation before the fifth week after discharge or release; and (2) limits the aggregate amount of compensation payable on the basis of Federal service in any benefit year."
