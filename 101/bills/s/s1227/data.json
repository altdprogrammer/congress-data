Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a procedure that would permit the Secretaries of State and Defense to have access to computer lists of license applications for missile equipment and technology. Provides for licensing of missile equipment and technology exports. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to report to the Congress annually on requests for and the granting of missile equipment and technology export licenses."
