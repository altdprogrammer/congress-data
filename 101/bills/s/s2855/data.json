    "text": "Critical Technologies Institute Act of 1990 - Establishes a federally funded research and development center to be known as the Critical Technologies Institute and to be responsible for: (1) surveying the views of U.S. industry, colleges and universities, and Federal and State agencies involved in research, development, or utilization of critical technologies; (2) identifying national research, development, and production capabilities with respect to critical technologies; and (3) preparing possible strategies for achieving such objectives. Places the Institute under the sponsorship of the Office of Science and Technology. Requires that the sponsorship agreement obligate the Institute to perform functions for the Office of Science and Technology and permit it to perform functions for the member agencies of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology that are not inconsistent with its responsibilities."
