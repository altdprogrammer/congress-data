Requires producers of any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, or other matter which contains one or more visual depictions, made after the effective date of this Act, of actual sexually explicit conduct to: (1) maintain records on every performer portrayed in such visual depiction; (2) ascertain their name and date of birth; and (3) affix a statement of the location of such records on every copy of such matter. Provides that proof that such a producer failed to comply with such requirements shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the performers were minors."
