Requires the majority of such lending to be for the private sector. Prohibits the provision of credit to parastatal organizations except for infrastructure projects for roads and bridges. Requires public sector loans to be used primarily to cover transition costs from socialist to free market economies. Conditions the provision of such assistance on progress in guaranteeing specified aspects of market economies."
