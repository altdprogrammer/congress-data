Sets forth the responsibilities of each Secretary. Directs those Secretaries to jointly develop and submit to the Congress management plans for: (1) the program established by this Act; and (2) continued tropical cyclone surveillance and reconnaissance which will adequately protect the citizens of U.S. coastal areas. Mandates that the management plans and programs required by this Act: (1) provide for at least the same degree and quality of protection as currently exists with a combination of satellite technology and manned flights; and (2) in no way allow any reduction in the level, quality, timeliness, sustainability, and area served of both the existing principal and back-up severe storm reconnaissance and tracking systems."
