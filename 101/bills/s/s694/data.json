Sets October 15, 1989, as the deadline for an interim report, and February 1, 1990, as the deadline for the final report. Imposes a moratorium upon Department of Energy sales of oil from the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills (except to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) until such final report has been submitted."
