Prohibits: (1) the Export-Import Bank from financing trade with China; (2) any Government agency from extending any loan, credit, credit guarantee, or insurance with respect to China; and (3) any Federal funds from being made available for activities of the Trade Development Program in, or for, China. Urges the Secretary of State to encourage U.S. allies to suspend any of their programs providing similar support to China. Prohibits the President from extending preferential treatment provided under the Generalized System of Preferences to Chinese products. Suspends the President's waiver with respect to China of the prohibition against providing most-favored-nation treatment to any country that imposes certain restrictions on emigration. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors to specified multilateral financial institutions to: (1) vote against or otherwise disapprove any loan, grant, or other form of economic or technical assistance to China; (2) propose and support downgrading China's membership status to that of observer status; and (3) urge U.S. allies to support such actions. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative to instruct the U.S. Representatives to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to propose and support the suspension of observer status for China at GATT. Bans Government funding for any commercial agreement with China and for U.S. participation in the U.S.-China Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade and the U.S.-China Commission on Trade. Suspends all licenses currently issued for export of items on the U.S. Munitions Control List or Commercial Control List to China. Prohibits funds appropriated or otherwise made available by law from being available for the processing or issuance of licenses required to export such items. Directs the Secretary of State to instruct the U.S. Representative to the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) to vote against or otherwise disapprove the export of any COCOM-controlled items by any COCOM participating country to China. Urges the Secretary to encourage U.S. allies to join U.S. efforts to disapprove such exports and suspend the export of other military items and advanced technology. Authorizes the President to limit the importation of any product or service of a foreign country to the extent to which such country benefits from, or otherwise takes commercial advantage of, any sanction or prohibition imposed by or under this Act. Creates a private right of action for any U.S. national required by this Act to terminate or curtail business activities in China against any party that takes commercial advantage or otherwise benefits from such termination or curtailment. Prohibits Government funding for: (1) U.S.-Chinese military cooperation; and (2) U.S. participation under any U.S.-China agreement or protocol on scientific cooperation. Directs the Attorney General to treat sympathetically requests by students from Tibet and China studying in the United States for Extended Voluntary Departure status until the President certifies to the Congress that the human rights of the Chinese and Tibetan peoples are recognized and respected by the Chinese Government."
