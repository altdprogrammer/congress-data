    "text": "Antitrust Procedures Improvement Act of 1989 - Amends the Sherman Act to increase the fines for criminal violations to $10,000,000 for corporations and $250,000 for individuals. Amends the Clayton Act to require that annual net sales and total assets of a partnership acquiring a business be based upon the greatest of the annual net sales or total assets of: (1) the partnership; (2) any general partner; (3) any partner having the right to at least 50 percent of the profits; or (4) any partner having the right, in the event of dissolution, to at least 50 percent of the assets of the partnership. Extends the waiting periods following premerger notifications for cash tender acquisitions. Allows the court to extend the additional period for up to 25 days if, due to the complexity or scope of information or documentary material to be evaluated, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Assistant Attorney General reasonably requires such additional time to determine whether the proposed acquisition may violate the antitrust laws. Increases the penalty for violations of the premerger notification requirements from $10,000 to $100,000 for each day a person is in violation. Authorizes the FTC to sue to recover such penalty unless the Attorney General determines during the 45-day period following FTC notification with regard to such action that such action would be inconsistent with U.S. enforcement policies."
