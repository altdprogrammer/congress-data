Earmarks a specified amount of such appropriations for television broadcasting to Cuba. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to authorize the credit of payments for certain USIA-produced publications, motion pictures, and television programs to the appropriate USIA appropriation. Amends the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 to modify preferences for U.S. contractors for certain USIA construction projects. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to authorize the USIA Director or other Government agencies to make grants to or for certain individuals participating in programs under such Act for health and accident insurance, emergency medical expenses, and the costs of preparing and transporting remains of individuals who die as dependents of participants in such programs. Requires the Director to make available in the United States 12 years after the initial dissemination USIA motion pictures and other materials prepared for dissemination abroad. Provides that the U.S. Archivist shall be the official custodian of such material. Authorizes the Archivist to charge fees to recover costs associated with the release of such materials and to deposit such fees into the National Archives Trust Fund. Repeals a provision of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 concerning limitations on Worldnet funding. Authorizes the USIA Director, upon approval by the Senate of the USIA's 1988 Senior Foreign Service Promotion List, to authorize the compensation and benefits of officers on such list to be computed and provided as if such list had been approved by the Senate on the date the Senate approved a comparable list of the Department of State. Title II - Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act - Requires the USIA Director to establish within USIA a Television Marti Service to be responsible for television broadcasts to Cuba. Designates such broadcasts as the USIA Television Marti Program. Requires presidential approval for the commencement of such broadcasts based upon a review of a certain television broadcasting test. Grants the Federal Communications Commission the authority to assign a spectrum to such broadcasts. Requires the service to avoid direct interference with domestic broadcasting. Amends the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act to redesignate the Advisory Board for Radio Broadcasting to Cuba as the Advisory Board for Radio and Television Broadcasting to Cuba. Authorizes Federal agencies, at the request of USIA, to assist USIA in carrying out this Act."
