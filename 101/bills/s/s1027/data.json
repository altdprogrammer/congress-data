Creates a technical assistance unit within REA to advise borrowers concerning permitted community and economic development activities. Authorizes REA to make loans to borrowers to enable them to provide water and waste disposal services in their areas. Requires borrowers to obtain private sector funds to supplement such assistance if the funds are available at affordable rates. Permits REA interest rate adjustments in order to facilitate private financing. Sets fiscal year loan limits at the lesser of $40,000,000 or ten percent of the total amount of telephone and electrification loans in such year."
