Deducts child and medical care costs from the income eligibility test. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by July 1, 1991, on State error rates in determining the Medicaid eligibility of pregnant women and infants. Suspends error rate penalties attributable to such eligibility determinations made from July 1, 1989, until one year after the Secretary's report. Phases-in mandatory Medicaid coverage of children whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Permits States to provide immediate Medicaid coverage of such children. Requires States to: (1) process Medicaid applications at locations which include locations other than those used for applications under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act; and (2) use applications other than those used under the AFDC program. Permits States to provide Medicaid coverage to children who have attained age one but not age six and whose family income does not exceed 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. (Currently, States are required to cover children between such ages whose family income does not exceed 133 percent of the Federal poverty level.) Authorizes States to provide Medicaid coverage of prenatal home visitation services for high-risk pregnant women and/or postpartum home visitation services for high-risk infants. Requires States which provide prospective Medicaid payments to hospitals to reimburse hospitals which serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients for exceptionally costly or lengthy stays by children."
