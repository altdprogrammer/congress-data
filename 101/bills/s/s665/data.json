    "text": "Supplemental Security Income Reform Act of 1989 - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to raise SSI resource eligibility limits. Increases such limits for each year after 1990 by the percentage increase in the consumer price index. Deems a child to be disabled for SSI eligibility purposes if the child suffers from any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which severely interferes with activities of daily living. Presumes any child who is born with any genetic or congenital condition which is extremely likely to result in disability to be disabled until age three. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) contract with the Institute of Medicine or any other appropriate nonprofit private organization for the development of childhood disability criteria and proposals for revisions of childhood impairment listings that take into account age-appropriate medical and functional criteria; and (2) publish revised listings within 18 months of this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary to publish a revision of specified listings of mental and emotional disorders which justifies each deviation from recommendations contained in the Revised Childhood Listings of Mental Impairments submitted by the Mental Impairment Listings Workgroup to the Associate Commissioner for Disability on April 1, 1986. Excludes $6,000 of property used in agriculture from parental resources in determining a blind or disabled child's SSI eligibility. Establishes a formula for determining the amount of parental resources deemed available to a disabled or blind child for SSI benefit and eligibility purposes. Requires the Secretary to establish and conduct SSI outreach programs for adults and children who may be eligible for SSI benefits. Requires that all Federal SSI application forms contain a questionnaire requesting each applicant to provide information on the manner in which he or she learned about the availability of SSI benefits. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and annually report to the Congress on the progress of such outreach programs."
