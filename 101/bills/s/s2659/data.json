    "text": "Reclamation Reform Act Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to revise certain definitions under such Act and to apply requirements of such Act to an operator of an agricultural enterprise on a given landholding or parcel of irrigation land. Requires each landowner, lessee, or operator, as a condition to the receipt of irrigation water for lands in a Bureau of Reclamation district, to furnish the district a certificate of compliance with the provisions of such Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish penalties for failure to comply with such Act. Prohibits a former owner who sold land from excess status from acquiring by involuntary foreclosure lands whose status has changed from nonexcess to excess. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Treasury to negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding to permit the Secretary of the Interior access to, and use of, information collected and maintained by the Departments of the Treasury and Agriculture which would aid enforcement of the ownership and pricing limitations of Federal reclamation law, including the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982."
