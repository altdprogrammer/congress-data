    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to plan and execute military training or military operations to aid civilian law enforcement agencies in connection with drug law enforcement, immigration control, or tariff regulation. Authorizes the use of military aircraft for transportation of, and flight training for, civilian law enforcement personnel and for aerial surveillance in connection with such functions. Authorizes the Secretary to make military personnel available for such functions without regard to the likelihood of any armed confrontation. Authorizes the Secretary to provide military support, in the form of personnel and equipment, if the Secretary determines that the importance of providing such support outweighs any short-term adverse effect on military preparedness. Excludes enlisted personnel and Reserve officers on active duty or full-time National Guard duty who are aiding civilian law enforcement agencies in such functions from inclusion in military end-strength computations."
