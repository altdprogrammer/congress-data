    "text": "Assault Weapon Control Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer, importation, transportation, shipping, receipt, or possession of: (1) any assault weapon; and (2) a large-capacity detachable magazine or ammunition belt which can be employed by a semiautomatic firearm. Provides exceptions for transfers to, and possession by, a Federal, State, or local government entity and lawful possessions before specified dates. Defines \"assault weapon\" to mean: (1) all firearms so designated under this Act (including Kalashnikov, Uzi, and AR-15 semiautomatic firearms); and (2) all other semiautomatic firearms which are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be assault weapons. Defines a large capacity magazine or belt as one which holds over ten rounds. Requires the Secretary: (1) within 30 days after enactment, to determine which firearms sold, or potentially sold, in the United States, in addition to those specifically designated in this Act, shall be designated as assault weapons; and (2) to publish and modify periodically a list of such firearms. Authorizes the Secretary to issue an emergency order, for up to 90 days, barring importation and sale of any firearms that may be designated as assault weapons. Precludes the designation of a firearm as an assault weapon if it meets specified criteria. Authorizes the Secretary to recommend to the Congress any appropriate modification of this Act, including the addition or deletion of firearms to be designated as assault weapons. Requires the Secretary to submit an initial report within three months of the enactment of this Act. Sets forth penalties for the use or possession of an assault weapon during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to apply the prohibition against the transfer or manufacture of firearms to assault weapons. Includes assault weapons in provisions regarding the maintenance of a central registry of all firearms in the United States which are not under U.S. possession or control. Requires registration of assault weapons within 30 days from the latter of the date the Secretary provides public notice that the type of firearm is designated as an assault weapon or the date the Secretary promulgates regulations for registration."
