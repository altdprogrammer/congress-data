    "text": "Cofiring Promotion Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish and implement a research and demonstration program for cofiring natural gas with coal in utility and large industrial boilers; and (2) enter into cooperative agreements with appropriate parties for demonstrating cofiring technology. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) include cofiring activities within the scope of the research and development income tax credit; (2) apply the accelerated cost recovery system to cofiring equipment; and (3) exclude depreciation associated with cofiring equipment from taxable income under the alternative minimum tax. Amends the Clean Air Act to provide that its new source performance standards do not include any physical change or change in the manner of operation of an electric utility or industrial boiler related to cofiring natural gas with coal (thus exempting such facilities from the Act's permit review and performance standards)."
