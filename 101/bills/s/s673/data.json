    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1989-08-03", 
    "text": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1989 - Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Amends the following Acts to authorize appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991: (1) the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966; (2) the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act with respect to bumper standards, automobile consumer information, and odometer requirements; and (3) the National Driver Register Act of 1982. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to derive a specified maximum amount from unobligated highway safety program funds to implement a national community education program regarding drunk driving prevention and the use and effectiveness of airbag technology. Title II: Side Impact Protection and Crashworthiness Data - Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 214 to establish performance criteria for improved occupant protection in side impacts; and (2) issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to extend the applicability of such Standard to multipurpose passenger vehicles. Directs the Secretary to enter into arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to study means of establishing a method for calculating a uniform numerical rating enabling consumers to compare meaningfully crashworthiness data for passenger automobiles and multipurpose passenger vehicles. Prescribes the contents of such study. Requires that a report of such study be submitted to the Secretary and the Congress within 19 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Prescribes schedules for: (1) obtaining public comment on implementation of National Academy recommendations; (2) determining whether an objectively based system of comparative crashworthiness data can be established; (3) promulgating a rule to establish such a system, if the determination is positive; (4) submitting the proposed rule for review to specified congressional committees; (5) waiting 60 calendar days after such submission, unless both committees notify the Secretary that they have no objection to the rule; and (6) establishing (by rule) procedures requiring auto dealers to make comparative crashworthiness data available to prospective customers. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to direct the Secretary to: (1) establish a schedule for use in ensuring compliance with each Federal motor vehicle safety standard established under such Act which the Secretary determines is capable of being tested; (2) establish written guidelines and procedures for conducting investigations regarding noncompliance with the regulations issued under such Act; and (3) establish criteria for the determination and imposition of civil penalties for such noncompliance. Requires the Secretary, 18 months after enactment of this Act, to require each State to provide for a uniform system for handicapped parking according to prescribed guidelines. Provides for reduction of apportioned funds for noncompliance. Directs the Secretary to complete rulemaking to: (1) revise specified motor vehicle safety standards regarding multipurpose passenger vehicles; (2) review the classification system for vehicles with a gross weight under 10,000 pounds to determine if such vehicles should be reclassified; (3) amend Federal motor vehicle safety standards to provide that lap and shoulder seatbelt protection for outboard rear seat passengers should be installed in passenger automobiles after specified dates and to provide for head restraints for multipurpose passenger vehicles; and (4) consider the establishment of a standard to protect against unreasonable risk of rollover of multipurpose passenger vehicles. Mandates that a specified percentage of certain authorized appropriations be used to disseminate consumer information regarding retrofitting passenger automobiles with lap and shoulder rear seatbelts. Directs the Secretary to establish a program requiring airbags for Federal passenger vehicles. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary to: (1) promulgate regulations establishing passenger motor vehicle bumper system labeling requirements; and (2) arrange with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of specified aspects of the effectiveness of State motor vehicle safety inspection programs for transmittal to certain congressional committees. Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to: (1) conduct a rulemaking to increase the safety of child booster seats used in passenger automobiles; and (2) authorize the Secretary of Transportation to direct the manufacturer of a defective motor vehicle or motor vehicle part to send a second notification if the Secretary determines that the first notification sent by such manufacturer has not resulted in an adequate number of vehicles (or items of equipment) being returned for remedy. Requires any lessor who receives notification of a defective motor vehicle part pertaining to any leased motor vehicle to send a copy of such notice to the lessee. Provides that a dealer may sell or lease a motor vehicle (or motor vehicle item) for which a safety defect notice has been received only if: (1) the defect or failure to comply has been remedied before delivery under sale or lease; or (2) an enforcement order has been set aside or restrained. Directs the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct a study of the use of darkened windshields and window glass in passenger automobiles, and to submit the results of such study to certain congressional committees. Directs the Secretary to amend the bumper standard published in the Code of Federal Regulations to ensure that such standard is identical to that in effect on January 1, 1982. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States which adopt and implement seatbelt and child restraint programs which include specified measures to foster the increased use of seatbelts and the correct use of child restraint systems. Sets conditions for the use of such grants by such States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking to: (1) consider methods of reducing head injuries in passenger automobiles and multipurpose passenger vehicles from contact with vehicle interior components by revising the appropriate Federal motor vehicle safety standards; and (2) consider the establishment of a standard to minimize pedestrian death and injury attributable to vehicle components."
