    "text": "Pediatric AIDS Resource Centers Act of 1989 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Director of the Office of Maternal and Child Health, during each fiscal year, to make grants to eligible consortia to aid in the development of centralized and decentralized Pediatric AIDS Resource Centers. Requires the grants to be used to provide a continuum of care for individuals infected with the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and the families of such individuals, and to improve the availability of services that prevent HIV infection among women of childbearing age, infants, children, and youth. Sets forth application requirements and provides for the uses of the grant funds, including both health and social services uses. Requires that the grants be made to consortia in areas that have a high incidence of HIV infection among women and children and areas whose low incidence is expected to increase. Requires matching contributions from the recipient consortia in specified percentages, subject to waiver by the Secretary. Limits grants, unless a waiver is issued by the Secretary, to five years. Requires at least ten percent of a grant to be used to promote the medical and social research capability of historically black colleges and universities that are participants in a consortium. Directs the Secretary, in making grants, to give priority to consortia that include minority community-based organizations located in and representative of communities and subpopulations reflecting the local incidence of the syndrome. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
