    "text": "Agricultural Research and Extension Planning, Priority Setting, and Technology Assessment Act of 1990 - Title I: Priorities for Agricultural Research and Extension System - Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to declare that the primary purpose of Federal involvement in both basic and applied agricultural research and extension activities shall be to: (1) enhance the sustainability and competitiveness of the food production and agricultural system of the United States; and (2) best ensure that it maximizes competitiveness and the social, environmental, human health, and food security interests of the United States. Sets forth specific emphases for agricultural research programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations interpreting and applying the purposes of this Act. Requires any proposal for a project that would be federally funded at $10,000 or more to identify both purposes and specified effects. Title II: Agricultural Research Planning and Priority-Setting Entities - Extends through FY 1995 and revises the membership and responsibilities of the National Agricultural Research and Extension Users Advisory Board and the Joint Council on Food and Agricultural Sciences. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Joint Council, to establish and oversee an Agricultural Science Technology Review Board which shall conduct technology assessment on research and extension projects to determine their effect on agriculture, the environment, and the social structure of urban and rural communities. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Clearinghouse on Agricultural Scientific Talent to collect and disseminate information on agricultural scientific expertise, research, and technology. Title III: Agricultural Research and Extension Funding Programs - Amends Federal law to revise the competitive grant program for high priority research. Authorizes appropriations, earmarking at least 30 percent for mission-linked applied research projects with a significant extension component. Declares the sense of the Congress: (1) that competitive grant programs should not be funded at the expense of programs; and (2) that such formula grant programs should be funded at a level that will maintain an effective infrastructure to conduct applied agricultural research and technology transfer programs."
