    "text": "Developmental Disabilities Assistance Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act to authorize appropriations with regard to persons with developmental disabilities for: (1) allotments to States for provision of services; (2) allotments to States for a system to protect legal and human rights; (3) grants to university affiliated programs, satellite centers, and university associated entities; and (4) projects of national significance. Modifies the required contents of annual reports on intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded. Changes from April 1 to July 1 the due date for an annual report by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the President, the Congress, and the National Council on the Handicapped regarding persons with developmental disabilities. Allows each State Planning Council to prepare and approve an annual budget and requires each Council to use the funds made available to it to employ such staff, obtain the services of such personnel, and carry out such activities as it determines necessary. Requires each State protection and advocacy system to obtain the approval of the Secretary, at least once every three years, of a plan outlining the system's priorities. Requires each university affiliated program to use funds from grants under specified provisions to establish and operate an advisory council."
