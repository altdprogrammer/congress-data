    "text": "Medical Residents' Student Loan Amendments Act of 1989 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions relating to repayment of student loans by medical residents. Provides that no borrower shall be eligible to be classified as a student for a deferment of student loan repayments while serving in a medical internship or residency program. Requires lenders to grant borrowers, upon written request, forbearance from student loan repayments, renewable at 12-month intervals, for the time remaining in the borrower's medical or dental internship, residency, or fellowship program. Prohibits lenders from: (1) charging an administrative or other fee in connection with granting such a forbearance; or (2) reporting adverse information regarding a borrower solely because of granting such a forbearance. Directs the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance to conduct, and complete within one year, a study examining: (1) indebtedness among graduate and professional students; and (2) the extent to which loan burden affects enrollment and persistence decisions of low-income, disadvantaged, and minority graduate students."
