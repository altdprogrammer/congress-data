    "text": "Marine Research Act of 1989 - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize the establishment of regional marine research programs (Programs) to coordinate, plan, and support research, monitoring, and assessment activities concerned with the environmental quality of marine and coastal waters. Authorizes the Governors of a majority of States in a marine research region to develop and submit for approval to the Regional Marine Research Oversight Board (Board) a combined, interstate proposal for a Program which identifies the research organizations which will participate in the Program and the goals of such Program. Requires proposals for a Program to be developed by a Regional Marine Research Organizing Committee consisting of the Director of the Sea Grant Program in each State in the region. Identifies the marine research regions as the Gulf of Maine region, Greater New York Bight region, Mid-Atlantic region, South Atlantic Bight region, Tropical region, Gulf of Mexico region, California region, North Pacific region, Gulf of Alaska, Bering and Arctic Seas region, and Insular Pacific region. Requires each Program to develop and submit for the Board's approval a three-year marine research and assessment plan which: (1) identifies research needs and priorities in the region over the next ten years, with emphasis on the upcoming three-to-five year period; (2) lists and describes research and assessment projects in the region which are expected to receive public or private funding; (3) describes the research and assessment projects to be given priority for funding under this Act; (4) reviews and discusses the coordination of projects addressing issues common to neighboring regions; and (5) lists the equipment and supplies used commonly for research projects in the region. Requires that the plan be updated and resubmitted to the Board at least once every three years. Authorizes each Program which has an approved research plan to submit an application to the Board for annual administrative, research, and equipment grants. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires each Program to support baseline monitoring of fundamental marine environmental conditions and prepare periodic assessments of marine environmental quality and resources in their region. Requires that such assessments be made available to the public as well as to local, State, and Federal agencies, the Board, and State Governors. Authorizes the establishment of the Regional Marine Research Oversight Board at the Federal level to manage and coordinate the efforts of the Programs and report periodically to the Congress on the activities and findings of such Programs. Authorizes and allocates appropriations."
