Authorizes NEH financial assistance to foster programs and projects that provide access to and preserve materials important to research, education, and public understanding of the humanities. Revises an allocation formula for certain excess NEH funds. Authorizes the following NEH annual awards: (1) the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities; and (2) the Charles Frankel Prize, to up to five persons each year for outstanding contributions to the public's understanding of the humanities.

Directs such Council to study public support for the arts at the Federal, State, and local levels. Provides for arts education. Authorizes the NEA Chairperson to pay the Federal share (up to 50 percent of project costs) of awarding arts education grants to and entering into contracts or cooperative agreements with schools, groups, arts institutions, State or other public agencies, and, where appropriate, individuals of exceptional talent engaged in or concerned with arts in education. Establishes, within the NEA, a National Arts Education Advisory Board. Directs the NEA Chairperson, with respect to the panels of experts which make recommendations for NEA assistance, to develop procedures to: (1) create an agency-wide panelist bank to ensure each panel-wide geographic, aesthetic, ethnic, and minority representation, with knowledgeable lay persons serving on such panels at all times, where feasible; (2) establish standardized panel procedures, where feasible; (3) require increased use of site visitations to view and report on an applicant's work, where necessary and feasible; (4) require a verbatim record of all panel deliberations and recommendations; and (5) require panel membership to change substantially from year to year, with no appointment to exceed three consecutive years. Requires that all meetings of the National Council on the Arts be open to the public. Directs the NEA Inspector General to conduct reviews to ensure grantee compliance with all regulations which relate to the administration of all NEA programs and operations. Directs the NEA Chairperson to establish sanctions for groups and individuals who use NEA funds to create, produce, or support a project or production which is found to be in violation of State criminal obscenity or child pornography laws, as determined by a court decision after final appeals, in a State in which it was produced or which was described in the grant award as a site of production. Includes among such sanctions repayment of such NEA funds and debarment from receiving additional NEA funds for at least three years or until the funds are repaid, whichever is longer. Provides for waiver of certain repayment deadlines. Requires notice of such sanctions to be included on the general information and guidance form provided to recipients of NEA funds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995 for the NEA and the NEH.

Title II: Museum Services - Amends the Museum Services Act (MSA) to revise membership and meeting requirements of the National Museum Service Board and certain provisions concerning the Director of the Institute of Museum Services. Revises provisions relating to the activities of the Institute of Museum Services. Provides that grants to museums may assist them in conservation of museum collections generally (currently \"artifacts and art objects\"). Expands eligibility for museum (and also conservation) services funding to include private, nonprofit professional museum or conservation-related organizations, research institutions, universities, or museums (currently only \"professional museum organizations\"). Removes a one-year limitation on funding of each such project. Authorizes appropriations FY 1991 through 1995 for: (1) grants to museums to increase and improve museum services; and (2) the Institute of Museum Services. Title III: Miscellaneous - Amends the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act to increase the maximum limits, for indemnity agreements under such Act, on: (1) aggregate loss or damage covered by all such agreements at any one time; (2) loss or damage covered for a single exhibition; and (3) the deductible for a single exhibition, according to the amount covered.
