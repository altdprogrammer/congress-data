    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-06-14", 
    "text": "Consumer Products Recovery Act of 1989 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require producers or importers of lubricating oil to recycle, through methods specified under this Act, an amount of used oil equal to at least the amount determined by multiplying the amount of lubricating oil produced or imported that year by such persons by the recycling percentage established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Authorizes such individuals to comply with this Act by: (1) recycling (through re-refining) used oil or purchasing re-refined oil for purposes of producing lubricating oil; or (2) purchasing recycling credits under this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish a recycling percentage that is two points higher than the existing recycling rate for lubricating oil. Provides for increases in such percentage of two points annually until 1999. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations allowing recyclers to create credits for used oil recycling and producers or importers of lubricating oil to purchase such credits. Provides that such regulations shall require: (1) owners or operators of used oil collection places to keep receipts issued by transporters who take delivery of such oil and copies of agreements under which the transporter agrees to take such oil to a recycling facility; (2) such owners or operators to certify that oil taken by transporters is not contaminated with hazardous wastes or substances above de minimis levels; (3) transporters to obtain an identification number from the Administrator and to keep certain records; (4) owners or operators of recycling facilities to be the only persons to create a recycling credit for the recycling credit system; (5) recyclers to certify that the substance being recycled is uncontaminated used oil; (6) oil proposed to be recycled to have come from a used oil collection place or a transporter with an identification number; (7) specified records to be kept by recyclers and by importers or producers; and (8) recyclers to sell or distribute in commerce such oil as specification used oil, off-specification used oil, hazardous waste fuel, or re-refined oil. Allows used oil re-refiners to exclude between 15 and 25 percent of re-refined oil from recycling requirements. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on such regulations and to include: (1) a discussion of the effects of such regulations on the oil industry and the environment; and (2) an evaluation of the level of the recycling percentage and whether such percentage should be increased in future years. Requires an updated version of such report to be submitted within ten years of this Act's enactment. Applies recycling requirements to persons who import or produce more than 100,000 gallons of lubricating oil annually. Sets the recycling percentage at 40 percent if the Administrator fails to promulgate such regulations. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress a plan for the recycling of certain commodities, including daily newspapers, used tires, lead acid batteries, pesticide containers, antifreeze, and specified volatile organic compounds. Requires such plan to include an incentive-based method for accomplishing such recycling. Directs the Administrator to implement such plan with respect to one commodity and with respect to an additional commodity each year thereafter. Provides that if used oil is identified as a hazardous waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, any fuel derived from such oil shall not be considered to be a hazardous waste after being reprocessed at a permitted facility. Requires persons who package lubricating oil to label such packages with a hazardous substance warning label and to include a telephone number for information on area recycling. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring States to develop plans for making information about used oil recycling available to the public. Requires the Administrator to establish a toll-free telephone line for information on State used oil recycling programs. Makes certain regulations proposed in the Federal Register on November 29, 1985, effective with respect to used oil management if the Administrator fails to promulgate regulations under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
