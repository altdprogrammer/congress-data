    "text": "United States Commission on Southern Africa Act - Establishes the United States Commission on Southern Africa to solicit private sector funds to develop skilled personnel in South Africa and Namibia, particularly in middle management business and government positions, by providing for the training of disadvantaged South Africans and Namibians in the fields of education, health care, law, and housing. Authorizes the Commission to establish and provide funds for human resource development programs and to provide scholarships and internships for appropriate study and training. Prohibits the use of such funds for programs conducted by or through South African organizations which are financed or controlled by the Government of South Africa. Authorizes the use of such funds only for programs which clearly reflect the objective of an end to apartheid. Provides for the annual audit of the Commission by certified public accountants. Authorizes the U.S. Comptroller General to carry out an annual audit of the Commission. Requires the Comptroller General to report such audits to the Congress. Directs the Commission to ensure that: (1) recipients of Commission assistance keep separate accounts of such assistance and records to facilitate effective audits; and (2) the Commission has access to such records. Requires the Commission to report annually to the Congress on its activities. Directs the Secretary of State to grant $1,000,000 of funds made available to the Department of State to the Commission for FY 1990."
