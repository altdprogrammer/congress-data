    "text": "International Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1990 - Declares U.S. policy to be to: (1) actively discourage the employment of children under age 15 in the production of goods for export or domestic consumption; (2) strengthen and supplement international trading rules to renounce the use of underage children in production for international trade competition; (3) amend Federal law to prohibit the entry into commerce of products resulting from underage child labor; and (4) offer assistance to foreign countries to improve their enforcement of national laws prohibiting employment of children under age 15, and to alleviate the underlying poverty that is often the cause of such exploitation. Urges the President to propose that the United Nations include a worldwide ban on trade in products of child labor in the Convention for the Rights of the Child. Directs the Secretary of Labor to conduct periodic reviews to identify any foreign country that: (1) has not adopted, or is not enforcing effectively, prohibitions against the use of child labor within the country; and (2) has continually exported products of child labor to the United States. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report to the Congress annually on foreign child labor laws and practices. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from permitting, with specified exceptions, during the identification period of a foreign country, the entry of any manufactured article that is a product of an industry in which there is demonstrable evidence of commercial exploitation of children. Sets forth procedures for certifying that an article is not a product of child labor. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for specified violations of this Act."
