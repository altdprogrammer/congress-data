Requires the Secretary of State to publish a report detailing the obligation of such nonlethal aid in the Federal Register every 90 days. Declares that the Congress will consider authorizing the President to transfer funds for providing military assistance to the resistance after February 27, 1990, unless the President has certified that the Nicaraguan Government has held free elections toward establishment of a democratic government."
