    "text": "Medicare Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinic Amendments of 1990 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to cover outpatient services provided by health centers which: (1) are eligible for Public Health Service Act grants to migrant health centers, community health centers, or for health care services to the homeless; or (2) were comprehensive federally funded health centers as of January 1, 1990. Makes deductibles inapplicable to services provided by such health centers. Permits such centers to waive Medicare coinsurance requirements when providing services to individuals who qualify for subsidized services under the Public Health Service Act. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve or disapprove a rural health clinic's application for certification within 60 days of the State agency's determination that the clinic qualifies for rural health clinic status. Establishes a temporary one-year waiver of certain staffing requirements for rural health clinics that, despite reasonable efforts, have been unable to hire appropriate personnel. Requires that productivity screening guidelines take into account the combined services of a rural health clinic's staff. Gives rural health clinics and health centers covered by this Act the same appeal and hearing rights as other Medicare providers. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require the automatic Medicaid certification of health centers which meet this Act's Medicare requirements and a uniform Medicaid payment methodology for such centers which is no more restrictive than that used to determine payments for rural health clinics. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to the Congress on whether physicians practicing in community and migrant health centers are able to obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals."
