    "text": "Library Services and Construction Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Library Services and Construction Act (the Act) to revise its programs and extend the authorization of appropriations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994 for grants (or activities) relating to: (1) library services; (2) public library and construction technology enhancement; (3) interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing; (4) library services for Indian tribes; (5) foreign language materials acquisition; (6) library literacy programs; and (7) evaluation and assessment. Revises allocations to Indian tribes and to Alaskan native villages, regional corporations, and village corporations. Requires assurances that libraries within the State receiving assistance shall not discriminate, in providing space for public meetings, on the basis of race, religion, age, gender, national origin, or handicapping condition. Provides for interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing under long-range State programs. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to: (1) coordinate specified programs; and (2) give the head of the State library administrative agency opportunity for comment on applications for foreign language and for library literacy grants before the award, to assure that the purposes of such grants are consistent with the long-range State program. Permits each State library agency, in FY 1990 and every fifth year thereafter, to review its expenditures under the programs from State and local sources and file with the Secretary a statement to establish a current, revised expenditure level to be used for measuring maintenance of effort. Requires library service programs to provide for assistance to libraries: (1) in developing intergenerational library programs matching older volunteers with libraries interested in developing after school literacy and reading skills programs for unsupervised school children; (2) in providing mobile library services and programs to child-care providers or centers which are licensed or certified by the State or otherwise meet the requirements of State law; and (3) in establishing model library literacy centers to reduce the number of functionally illiterate individuals and help them reach full employment. Authorizes a State, in carrying out its library services program, to make subgrants to library systems or networks which include libraries other than public libraries, if the purpose of the subgrant is to improve services for public library patrons. Allows States to ratably reduce payments to major urban resource libraries only under specified conditions. Revises services for institutionalized individuals under certain maintenance of effort requirements to make them services to handicapped individuals generally. Requires State library services programs to provide assistance to public libraries for technology enhancement to improve services. Provides for grants to develop the technological capacity of libraries for interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing. Requires that public library construction projects follow policies and procedures that will promote the preservation of library and information resources in such facilities. Requires that a statewide resource sharing plan be directed toward attaining compliance with specified provisions. Authorizes the State long-range interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing program to: (1) include a statewide preservation cooperation plan; and (2) identify the preservation objectives to be achieved during the period covered by the long-range plans. Authorizes: (1) the use of funds to carry out such preservation cooperation plan; and (2) part or all of such preservation program to be contracted to other agencies or institutions. Raises the maximum limit on the amount of a single Library Literacy Program grant from $25,000 to $35,000. Exempts major urban resource libraries from the $15,000 maximum limitation on grants for foreign language materials acquisition; but prohibits the Secretary from using more than 30 percent of total grant funds to make grants to such libraries in amounts exceeding such limitation. Authorizes the Secretary, directly or by grants or contracts, to evaluate and assess programs under the Act. Retitles title I of the Act as Public Library Services."
