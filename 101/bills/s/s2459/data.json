    "text": "Medicaid Child Health Act of 1990 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to phase-in mandatory Medicaid coverage of children whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Permits States to provide Medicaid coverage to children whose family income does not exceed 185 percent of the Federal poverty level and to foster care children. Prohibits States from considering the value of an automobile, household goods, personal effects, burial spaces, or insurance policies when determining a pregnant woman's Medicaid eligibility. Makes pregnant women who are presumptively eligible for Medicaid benefits and apply for such benefits within a time period specified by the State, but set at no less than 14 days, eligible for such benefits until the State determines otherwise. Requires States to continue the Medicaid coverage of a woman and her infant for 60 days after delivery regardless of fluctuations in her income during such period. Prohibits the redetermination of the Medicaid eligibility of a child under age six who has been deemed eligible less than six months previously, unless such eligibility is due to his or her receipt of aid under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) or E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Act or under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Act. Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of a child under age six who loses such aid until it is determined that he or she is not eligible for Medicaid on some other basis. Requires that Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital services provided to children at hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients: (1) make an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for exceptionally long or costly cases if such payments are made on a prospective basis; (2) not impose durational limitations on such services; and (3) not set dollar limits on the delivery of services to individuals who enter the hospital prior to their first birthday. Permits States to cover home and community-based services for children who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or are medically dependent on a ventilator for life support. Allows States to cover home visitor services furnished by registered nurses to infants, during the first six months of life, who require treatment with life sustaining medication or equipment or technically-assisted feeding. Prohibits the Secretary from limiting to fewer than 500 (currently, 200) the number of individuals in a State who may receive home and community-based services under a waiver of certain Medicaid requirements. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) develop definitions of medically high risk pregnancy and children at a high risk of medical problems; (2) develop alternative definitions of medically uninsurable children; (3) develop a model health benefit package for pregnant women and children; and (4) study different methodologies to improve the coordination between various public health programs. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires States to provide Medicaid coverage to all children under age 18 who are SSI recipients. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require that a preplacement health care record for a child be provided to such child's foster care provider and be completed before he or she is placed in foster care or within 30 days after an emergency foster care placement. Requires the maintenance of a health care plan and record for such child while he or she is in foster care, and notification of the provider concerning such child's eligibility for Medicaid early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment services. Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to reduce the lag time between the Secretary's calculation of the Federal matching rate under the AFDC, Medicaid, and Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs and its implementation. Amends the Medicaid program to reimburse States, at the Federal Medicaid assistance percentage, for outreach services identifying Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and infants and assisting them in applying for Medicaid coverage. Provides that Medicaid waivers to promote the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of pregnancy-related services shall be for an initial three-year term and, upon the Secretary's approval, additional five-year terms."
