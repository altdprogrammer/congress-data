Allows State grant allotments to be used for the operation of: (1) dependent care resource and referral systems; and (2) school-age child care services before and after school. Requires amounts used for the operation of such child care services to be designed to enable program participation by children whose families lack adequate financial resources. Repeals prohibitions on use of funds for: (1) paying the costs of operation of any resource and referral system or before and after school child care program; or (2) subsidizing the direct provision of dependent care services, including child care services. Requires each State Governor to report certain information on: (1) number and characteristics of children served in before and after school child care programs; (2) salaries and benefits paid to employees in such programs; and (3) number and characteristics of clients served in resource and referral systems. Extends through FY 1991 the period for required revisions of program descriptions in State applications."
