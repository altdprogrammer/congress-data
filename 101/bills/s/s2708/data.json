Requires the Director to: (1) enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Army (Secretary) and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator) regarding their implementation responsibilities; and (2) require non-Federal contributions in accordance with recommendations developed under the study mandated by this Act. Limits the total Federal share of any implementation activity to 80 percent of the cost of that activity. Mandates that the Director carry out implementation activities in accordance with the goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, and consistent with the jurisdictional authorities of the State directors responsible for the management and conservation of the fish and wildlife resources of specified States over Great Lakes fishery resources. Requires the Director, in administering programs related to the Great Lakes, to seek to achieve specified goals. Requires the Director to establish: (1) a centrally located facility for the coordination of all Service activities in the Great Lakes System, to be known as the Great Lakes Coordination Office; and (2) an office for the implementation of fishery restoration and enhancement projects in the lower Great Lakes, to be known as the Lower Great Lakes Fisheries Assistance Office (Assistance Office). Requires the Assistance Office to be centrally located in the lower Great Lakes region so as to facilitate activities relating to Lakes Erie and Ontario.
