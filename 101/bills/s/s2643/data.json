Authorizes such offices to establish revolving funds and to deposit proceeds from the sale of paper for recycling in the funds. Requires the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to ensure that the same actions are taken in the Congress. Directs the Administrator to establish requirements for procuring agencies described in the Solid Waste Disposal Act for the procurement of paper meeting specified minimum recycled content standards. Exempts procuring agencies from such requirements under specified conditions. Directs the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate to ensure that paper meeting minimum recycled content standards is used in the Congress. Requires paper purchased under contracts procuring 10,000 pounds or more of paper to meet such standards. Directs the Public Printer, in providing services to the Congress, to ensure that the Government Printing Office uses paper meeting such standards. Requires the Administrator to study methods of waste source reduction in Federal procurement practices and to promulgate guidelines for practicable source reduction methods. Directs the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate to ensure that waste source reduction practices are implemented in the Congress."
