Sets forth the eligibility requirements for such program. Provides that an individual becomes a participant in such program only upon the Secretary's approval of the individual's application and acceptance of the submitted contract, under which: (1) the Secretary must agree to provide a scholarship; and (2) the individual must maintain enrollment in a specified course of study, maintain an acceptable level of academic standing, and serve for a time period equal to one service year for each scholarship year in a public or nonprofit private health care facility, or in a private health care facility in a medically underserved area. Requires the scholarship to consist of payment of tuition and all other reasonable educational expenses during the school year, plus a monthly stipend. Requires the individual to repay the United States if he or she breaches the scholarship contract. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1989 and succeeding fiscal years."
