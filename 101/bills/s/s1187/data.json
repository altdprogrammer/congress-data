    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-06-14", 
    "text": "Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Improvement Act of 1989 - Repeals provisions of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (the Act): (1) establishing a Supplemental Medicare Premium; (2) providing Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) coverage of prescription drugs and insulin, home intravenous drug therapy services, screening mammographies, and in-home care for chronically dependent individuals; and (3) requiring Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) coverage of pregnant women and infants, and Medicare cost-sharing amounts incurred by individuals whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such Medicaid coverage should be restored within the framework of the budget resolution for FY 1990. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human services to conduct a study and report to the Congress, by January 1, 1990, on the possibility of reinstating repealed Medicare benefits. Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program to eliminate provisions waiving the imposition of an additional deductible on persons hospitalized in December of one year and rehospitalized in January of the following year or hospitalized in 1990 for a spell of illness which began prior to 1989. Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program to cover all of the reasonable out-of-pocket part A and B expenses a part B enrollee incurs in excess of $2,500 in 1990, adjusting such ceiling annually thereafter so as to maintain the percentage of enrollees exceeding such cap at the 1990 percentage. Delays, from January 1, 1990, to October 1, 1990, the coverage of nursing care and home health aide services as home health services. Includes in the computation of the part B premium an amount equal to the Secretary's estimate of a part B enrollee's share of the benefits and administrative costs which result from catastrophic care coverage and the beneficiary expense ceiling. Delays, from April 1, 1989, to April 1, 1990, the date by which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management must report to the Congress regarding: (1) changes to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program that may be required to incorporate FEHB plans designed for Medicare-eligible individuals and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the program; and (2) the feasibility of adopting National Association of Insurance Commissioners Model Standards for Medicare supplemental policies when providing Medicare supplemental plans as a type of FEHB plan."
