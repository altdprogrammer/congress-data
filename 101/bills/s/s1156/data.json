    "text": "Export Promotion and Market Development Act of 1989 - Title I: United States and Foreign Commercial Service - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the International Trade Administration, to develop and submit to the Congress a five-year export market development strategy, together with annual updates. Requires the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to assign a small business specialist to each U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service district and branch office in the United States. Makes such specialists responsible for: (1) helping to increase the Service's responsiveness to small businesses; and (2) assisting such businesses to compete in international markets. Authorizes appropriations for the Service. Requires the Service to retain all user fees it collects in order to continue the programs from which such fees were derived. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Service a one-stop shop to provide to exporters and other interested persons export information from specified U.S. agencies. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the principal responsibility of Service officers serving abroad is the promotion of U.S. exports, the assistance of U.S. exporters, and the development of U.S. foreign markets. Title II: Export Finance - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to authorize appropriations to the Export-Import Bank for FY 1990 for direct loans to promote the export of U.S. goods and services. Requires the Bank to conduct a continuing review of documentation it uses and to take action to simplify its loan agreements and other forms. Directs the President, with respect to the maintenance of the U.S. defense industrial base, to: (1) examine the role of export financing in the decline of U.S. defense exports; (2) determine the extent other countries support commercial financing for defense exports through government credit programs; (3) determine the extent to which U.S. private capital is used to support defense exports and the obstacles U.S. lending institutions face in providing support; and (4) make recommendations for mobilizing private capital to support U.S. defense exports through government guarantee programs. Authorizes the Bank to be reimbursed for travel, subsistence, and other expenses related to its objectives. Title III: Consideration of Export Impact in Federal Rules - Requires any agency preparing a regulatory agenda or analysis of any rule to consider the impact of such rule on U.S. small businesses' ability to compete in the international market. Directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to monitor any impact. Title IV: Cargo Preference - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to exempt the export of agricultural commodities from certain requirements of cargo preference laws. Title V: International Education and Foreign Language Instruction - Directs the Secretary of Education to review the emphasis placed in the public schools on global economics, world geography, foreign languages, and other cultures. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make demonstration grants to primary and secondary schools to develop programs in foreign language instruction. Authorizes appropriations."
