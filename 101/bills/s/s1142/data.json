    "text": "Boot Camp Prison Demonstration Program Act of 1989 - Directs the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, to establish four military-style boot camp prisons within the Federal prison system. Requires the Attorney General to ensure that such prisons provide educational and counseling programs as part of the inmates' confinement. Amends the Federal criminal code to provide such prisons as a sentencing option and an alternative to conventional prisons for defendants who: (1) are sentenced to 12 to 16 months in prison; (2) are under 25 years of age; (3) are able-bodied; (4) have been convicted of a serious but nonviolent offense; (5) have no serious prior criminal history; and (6) consent to such confinement. Credits an inmate placed in a prison boot camp with four days toward completion of the sentence for each day served in such camp. Terminates such prisons five years after this Act's enactment. Directs the Attorney General to evaluate such prisons and report to the Congress within four and one-half years with respect to the efficacy of such prisons with an assessment of: (1) recidivism rates of defendants sentenced to boot camp prisons as compared to similar defendants not sentenced to such prisons; and (2) the cost effectiveness of such prisons as compared to conventional prisons. Authorizes the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to use closed military facilities for such prisons. Authorizes appropriations."
