    "date": "1990-09-19", 
    "text": "Tribal Cattle Herd Pilot Project Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Tribal Cattle Herd Pilot Project (TRICAPP) to enable Indian tribes to secure at low-interest loan guarantees or direct loans to purchase cattle herds for tribal members to establish, maintain, or expand their individual cattle operations. Sets forth criteria tribal members must meet to be eligible to be selected by their tribe to receive cattle under TRICAPP. Requires Indian tribes securing such loans to pledge income from tribal enterprises as collateral. Declares that all cattle purchased under TRICAPP shall remain tribal property, secured by a conditional sales contract with the Federal Government as first lienholder, until such time as the tribe has repayed the loans used to purchase such cattle. Directs the Secretary to establish the TRICAPP Consortium to assist the participating tribes in successfully implementing TRICAPP. Authorizes the Secretary, in selecting the tribes to participate in TRICAPP, to give priority to the following Northern Great Plains tribes: (1) Cheyenne River Sioux; (2) Oglala Sioux; (3) Crow Creek Sioux; (4) Northern Cheyenne; and (5) Fort Belknap Community Council. Limits to ten the number of Indian tribes that may participate in TRICAPP. Directs Indian tribes, in order to participate in TRICAPP, to: (1) develop a plan of operation to be certified by their respective Tribal Councils and an assessment which describe, respectively, how they will satisfy specified requirements in administering TRICAPP and the need for TRICAPP on their reservation; and (2) enter into an agreement with an appropriate financial institution to establish an Operator's Contingency Reserve Fund to cover certain lossess not otherwise covered of individual participating operators who have entered into a contract with their tribe in order to participate in TRICAPP. Specifies the terms and conditions of such a contract, including requiring operators to pledge personal or real property as collateral for TRICAPP cattle unless they are granted an exemption. Requires participating tribes to repay loans secured under TRICAPP by annual payments from the sale of calves produced from TRICAPP cattle or from other tribal revenues. Permits Indian tribes to generate funds for repaying such loans from specified sources. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to: (1) Indian tribes who apply to participate in TRICAPP to assist them in development plans of operation and assessments; and (2) Indian tribes participating in TRICAPP and the TRICAPP Consortium through grants made to State land grant colleges by the Department of Agriculture and funded by the Department of the Interior in the form of educational programs for managing tribal cattle and marketing beef. Outlines administrative provisions regarding Operator's Contingency Reserve funds, record-keeping requirements, and inspection and branding of TRICAPP cattle. Provides for the repossession of cattle for violations of this Act. Amends the Indian Financing Act of 1974 to increase the authorization of appropriations for interest payments for financing Indian economic development. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 2000."
