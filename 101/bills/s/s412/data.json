Title II: Social Security Act - Amends title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act to establish a program of allotments to States to carry out plans to address deficiencies in the supply of child care and to expand and improve child care services, emphasizing services to low-income areas. Describes application procedures, authorized fund uses, and entities eligible for assistance. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report to specified congressional committees concerning the program, as well as a later report evaluating the program's effectiveness.
