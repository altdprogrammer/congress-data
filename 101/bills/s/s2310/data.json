    "text": "Hunger Prevention Act of 1990 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to authorize the food stamp program through FY 1995. Increases the basic benefit level by specified increments through FY 1994 and after, according to formulae involving the rising cost of the thrifty food plan. Permits the use of food stamps to purchase meals at homeless shelters and soup kitchens as well as private establishments (like restaurants) which contract with a State to offer meals for qualifying persons at concessional prices. Permits the use of appropriations to make grants for projects designed to improve the effectiveness of the program in delivering food assistance to the homeless. Allows families in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program to receive the first $50 of child support payments each month without lowering their food stamp benefits. Repeals the cap on the excess shelter deduction, permitting all eligible households to deduct the full amount of excess shelter costs in the determination of food stamp benefits. Raises from $4,500 to $5,500 after January 1, 1991, the limit on the value of a motor vehicle an eligible family may own. Requires annual cost-of-living adjustments to such limit beginning October 1, 1991. Provides for the issuance of food stamp coupons by mail to households in rural areas where low-income persons face substantial difficulties in obtaining transportation. Reauthorizes Nutrition Assistance to Puerto Rico through FY 1995. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct pilot projects that test changes in, and new, food stamp program administrative and eligibility determination procedures designed to increase participation in rural areas. Authorizes State agencies to implement on-line electronic benefit transfer systems in which household benefits are issued from and stored in central data banks and electronically accessed by household members at the point-of-sale. Directs the Secretary to establish standards for approving such systems. Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to: (1) rename it the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983; and (2) reauthorize it through FY 1995. Amends the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 to extend through FY 1995 commodity support for soup kitchens and food banks which primarily serve the homeless. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to increase authorized appropriations for FY 1991 and the three subsequent fiscal years. Amends the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 to reauthorize the Commodity Supplemental Food Program through FY 1995. Amends the National School Lunch Act to earmark funds through FY 1994 for assistance to homeless preschool children."
