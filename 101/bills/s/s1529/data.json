    "text": "Intellectual Property Protection Act of 1989 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 which provides a remedy to prevent imported products which infringe the patents of U.S. businesses from entering the U.S. market. Directs the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to identify those foreign countries which, because of unreasonable delays in granting or enforcing patents or unnecessarily narrow interpretations of patent claims by the authorities which determine patent validity and infringement, effectively deny adequate and effective protection for the intellectual property of U.S. nationals. Requires the Commissioner to publish such list in the Federal Register and transmit copies to the Chairman of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), the Attorney General, and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. Directs the USITC, upon determining there is reason to believe that a product from a listed country involves a violation of the patent protections of such Act, to issue appropriate orders to prevent importation of such product without considering the effect of such orders upon specified factors that otherwise might preclude their issuance. Limits the defenses available during a USITC investigation of a foreign product under this Act. Waives the requirement that a USITC determination in such a case be referred to the President for approval. Makes such determination final upon publication in the Federal Register. Eliminates the current exemption from such a USITC determination for any such products imported for the use of the Federal Government."
