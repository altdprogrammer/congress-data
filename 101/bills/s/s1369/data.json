Requires the Secretary to submit an annual status report to the Congress on such program. Directs the President to establish a Blue Ribbon Task Group on Environmental Restoration and Defense Waste Management to examine and report to the President and the Congress regarding environmental restoration activities and defense waste management operations and disposal. Requires the President to report to certain congressional committees on the Task Force membership and a detailed plan for completing the Task Force's report to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to establish a management training program for DOE personnel involved in the management of atomic energy defense activities. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to: (1) provide for the safe disposition of hazardous waste resulting from nuclear materials activities; and (2) implement research and development of technologies needed for effective negotiation and verification of international agreements on control of special nuclear materials and weapons."
