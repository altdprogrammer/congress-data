Establishes NIJ Ballistic Resistance of Police Body Armor standard number 0101.03 as the interim standard for the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of body armor until the Federal standards are established. Requires manufacturers of body armor subject to the Federal standards to: (1) submit representative samples of body armor on a periodic basis to NIJ to be tested for compliance with the Federal standards; and (2) affix labels to body armor manufactured in compliance with such standards. Establishes criminal and civil penalties for manufacturing, offering for sale, or distributing in commerce any body armor not complying with the interim standard or mandatory Federal standards. Directs the General Accounting Office to complete a study of all body armor standards and test protocols for body armor for submission to NIJ and the House and Senate Judiciary Committees."
