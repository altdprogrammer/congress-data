    "text": "Disabled Children's and Widow's Eligibility Reform Act of 1990 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to repeal the separate definition of disability applicable to widows and widowers. Provides full widow's or widower's insurance benefits to disabled widows or widowers without regard to age or when their disability began. Amends the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program (title XVI of the Social Security Act) to preserve the Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) eligibility of disabled widows or widowers who become ineligible for SSI benefits upon the implementation of this Act's amendment repealing the separate definition of disability applicable to widows and widowers. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider age-appropriate medical criteria and limitations on activities of daily living developed by childhood disability experts in reviewing and revising the medical criteria for evaluating child impairments. Establishes a presumption that a child under age four with a genetic or other diagnosed impairment is disabled or blind for SSI purposes if it is probable that clinical and laboratory techniques administered when the child is older will accurately demonstrate that the medical severity of such impairment is sufficient for SSI eligibility purposes. Requires the Secretary to make every reasonable effort to include the evaluation of a pediatrician or pediatric specialist in the determination of a child's eligibility or continuing eligibility for SSI disability benefits."
