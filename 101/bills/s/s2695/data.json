    "text": "Anti-drug Abuse Act of 1990 - Title I: International Efforts to Reduce Illegal Drug Production and Drug Trafficking - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) direct the Secretary of State to negotiate with the Governments of Canada and Mexico for the establishment of a North American Narcotics Council to explore ways and means of facilitating the exchange of information in anti-narcotics efforts and in substance abuse reduction and education programs, increasing cooperation in anti-narcotics efforts, and improving efforts to supply assistance to source and trafficking countries and to explore other areas and programs necessary to reduce the demand and supply of illicit narcotics and psychotropic substances; and (2) submit to the Congress, for each fiscal year in which the United States participates in the Council, a budget request to cover the expenses of such participation. Sets forth provisions for the appointment of a permanent U.S. representative to the Council, congressional advisors provisions for termination of such Council, and reporting requirements. Requires the President, with respect to each year after 1989, to determine whether: (1) there was a reduction in the quantity of illicit coca produced or in illicit coca activities in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru; and (2) any reduction is attributable to the implementation of social or economic alternatives in such countries. Authorizes the President, if an affirmative determination with respect to such a country is made and the Congress enacts a law approving it, to apply special trade treatment to articles that: (1) are products of such country; and (2) are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption in U.S. customs territory in the year following the year such determination was made. Specifies that if the granting of such special trade treatment would violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, provisions of this Act shall be inapplicable until the President obtains a waiver of the provision which is the basis for such violation. Prohibits such special treatment if specified actions under the Narcotics Control Trade Act are in effect with respect to such country or if such treatment is restricted under countervailing duties or trade dumping regulations. Authorizes the President to provide economic assistance to Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru to promote the production, processing, or marketing of agricultural commodity exports, excluding commodities from which narcotic and psychotropic drugs are derived. Waives provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act that prohibit economic assistance for the growth or production in a foreign country of commodities which would compete with similar U.S. commodities with respect to such assistance. Establishes an Interagency Task Force on Combatting Illicit Narcotics and an Interagency Task Force on Money Laundering. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) assist major illicit drug producing and drug-transit countries in adopting national legislation to accommodate treaties on mutual assistance in criminal matters and on extradition; and (2) provide technical assistance and advice aimed at strengthening their judicial, legal, and law enforcement systems. Prohibits furnishing assistance related to the control, reduction, or elimination of illicit drug production or trafficking to any major drug producing or drug-transit country without certifications of cooperation by such countries with the efforts of the U.S. Government assisted by the Task Forces. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States should support the actions of Latin American jurists in prosecuting drug criminals; and (2) the President should take steps to convene an international judicial conference, emphasizing worldwide support for prosecuting drug traffickers and enabling senior judicial officials to exchange information on anti-narcotic laws and statutes. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for the procurement of at least four AH-1W Cobra helicopters. Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer such helicopters to the Government of Colombia for the training of Colombian personnel and use in carrying out anti-drug interdiction operations in Colombia. Urges the Secretary of State to implement proposals from U.S. allies for combating illicit narcotics, including cooperation in law enforcement, interdiction, prevention, treatment, and research. Title II: Interdiction - Subtitle A: Department of State - Authorizes appropriations for the procurement of twin-engine helicopters to expand joint operations with law enforcement officials of major drug transshipment countries and of Bolivia and Peru. Subtitle B: Customs Service - Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for marine interdiction, additional canine enforcement teams, research and development, and to increase the number of full-time Customs Service inspectors deployed at ports of entry under the contraband inspection program. Subtitle C: Coast Guard - Authorizes appropriations for procurement of HH-60J utility helicopters to increase joint Coast Guard and Bahamian operations and to increase the full-time personnel of the Coast Guard. Subtitle D: Defense - Authorizes appropriations for the Army National Guard to upgrade their surveillance helicopters. Provides for: (1) the deployment of such helicopters by Guard units of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah to support interdiction operations carried out by civilian law enforcement agencies; and (2) coordination with specified agencies. Authorizes appropriations to the DOD for airborne early warning surveillance (AEW) aircraft. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to make the P-3 AEW aircraft available to the Customs Service. Title III: Law Enforcement - Subtitle A: Capital Punishment - Capital Punishment Procedures Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Sets forth special aggravating factors for espionage, treason, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President. Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified based on consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating factors. States that no person who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or victim in its consideration of the sentence. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the court of appeals, upon consideration of the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Sets forth procedures for the implementation of the sentence of death. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) \"murder for hire\"; (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); and (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death. Increases the minimum sentence to life imprisonment for the crime of bank robbery which results in death. Provides for appointment of counsel where a defendant is charged with a crime with respect to which a sentence of death is sought and is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Subtitle B: Habeas Corpus Reform - Reform of Federal Intervention in State Proceedings Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal judicial code to condition consideration of a habeas corpus claim by a prisoner on a showing of actual prejudice resulting from the Federal right violated and that: (1) State or Federal Government action precluded assertion of that right; (2) the Federal right did not previously exist; (3) the factual basis of the claim could not have been discovered by reasonable diligence; or (4) the violation asserted probably resulted in an erroneous conviction, a sentence predicated on an erroneous conviction, or a sentence predicated on an erroneous factual determination. Establishes a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners and a two-year statute of limitations for similar motions made by Federal prisoners. Vests authority to issue certificates for probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. Permits denial on the merits of habeas corpus writs notwithstanding the failure to exhaust State remedies. Prohibits the granting of a habeas corpus writ with respect to any claim which has been fully and fairly adjudicated in State proceedings. Provides for appointment of counsel for a petitioner who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel at the court's discretion, with exceptions. Subtitle C: Exclusionary Rule - Prohibits the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence in a Federal criminal proceeding on the grounds that such evidence was obtained in violation of the fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Makes the United States liable for any damages resulting from a search or seizure conducted by an investigative or law enforcement officer, acting within the scope of his office or employment, in violation of the fourth amendment. Establishes guidelines for the award of punitive damages. Limits the amount of awards under this Act. Authorizes disciplinary sanctions against an officer who conducted such a search or seizure lacking a good faith belief that such search or seizure was constitutional. Subtitle D: Interstate Transportation for Purposes of Drug Activity - Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to prohibit the transport in interstate or foreign commerce of a person for the purpose of engaging in the growing, harvesting, manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled or counterfeit substance. Subtitle E: Drug-Free School Zones - Directs the Attorney General to develop a model program of strategies and tactics for establishing and maintaining drug-free school zones which provides State and local law enforcement agencies with materials, training, and other assistance to establish, enforce, and evaluate the effectiveness of drug-free school zone enforcement efforts. Requires that such program define the criminal justice community's role in creating and maintaining such zones, develop a framework for law enforcement collaboration with the school system and community resource network, provide materials and technical assistance for demarcating and establishing such zones, and create a uniform framework for monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle F: Drug Testing of Defendants on Probation or Supervised Release - Requires: (1) the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to establish a program of drug testing of criminal defendants on post-conviction release; and (2) the chief probation officer in each district to arrange for the drug testing of such defendants. Requires, as an explicit condition of probation, parole, or supervised release of a defendant involving a felony or a specified violent or drug offense, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to periodic drug tests. Sets limitations on the authority to require such tests and to take action against a defendant based on test results. Subtitle H (sic): Firearms and Related Amendments - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer of firearms to non-residents of the State in which the transferor resides. Provides for the disposition of forfeited firearms. Classifies as serious drug offenses for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 serious drug offenses committed by juveniles. Specifies that if a conviction was for a violent felony involving the threatened or actual use of a firearm or explosives, or was for a serious drug offense, such person shall be considered convicted for purposes of this Act irrespective of any pardon, setting aside, expunction, or restoration of civil rights. Permits the judicial officer to consider pretrial detention with respect to certain firearms and explosives offenses. Provides for enhanced penalties for: (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses. Sets forth penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking and for theft of firearms and explosives. Bars the sale or possession of firearms and explosives to or by persons convicted of violent or serious misdemeanor drug or narcotic offenses. Provides for the mandatory revocation of the supervised release of an individual for possession of a firearm. Increases penalties for: (1) making knowingly false, material statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer; and (2) a second offense of using an explosive to commit a Federal felony. Subtitle I: Alien Witnesses - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the Attorney General to adjust to lawful permanent residence status the status of any alien: (1) who agrees to cooperate in the prosecution of individuals who have committed U.S. drug offenses; (2) on whom the prosecutor completes a threat assessment questionnaire; and (3) who is otherwise admissible as an immigrant. Authorizes protection, if necessary, for such an alien under the witness protection program. Subtitle J: Civil Forfeiture - Eliminates a restriction on the disposal of judicially forfeited property by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postal Service.

Title IV: Prevention, Treatment, and Education - Subtitle A: Drug Testing - Quality Assurance in the Private Sector Drug Testing Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to prohibit performing toxicological analysis in connection with a drug testing program unless certified. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program for certifying laboratories for performing drug tests, with annual review of certification criteria. Requires an employer, as a condition of maintaining a drug testing program, to establish a written anti-drug abuse policy and a drug-free awareness program. Declares that nothing in this Act prohibits an employer from requiring a drug test of applicants and, in certain circumstances, employees. Sets forth certain employee protections, including requiring several types of notice and prohibiting: (1) subject to exception, adverse action based on unconfirmed results; and (2) retaliation for exercise of an employee right. Prohibits disclosure of test results, except in specified circumstances. Declares that nothing in this Act prohibits an employer from: (1) taking action necessary to ensure a safe workplace; (2) taking necessary action, including termination, in certain circumstances; (3) requiring certain employees to participate in a treatment program; or (4) refusing to place or reinstate an employee with a confirmed positive test in a sensitive position.

Declares that this Act does not require an employer to establish a drug testing program or make employment decisions based on test results.

Allows professional athletes to be treated as sensitive employees, except that they are not covered by provisions prohibiting disclosure of test results. Subtitle B: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require the Attorney General to transfer half of the moneys and proceeds from civil or criminal forfeitures (after payment of certain expenses) to the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) for community development. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 (Tariff Act) to require the Commissioner of Customs to make available to the Administrator of ADAMHA not less than half of appropriated funds that are utilized by the Commissioner for community development. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Administrator of ADAMHA to transfer amounts made available under the CSA and Tariff Act in order to make grants for programs operated by local law enforcement agencies to support prevention and education programs. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to establish a drug salvager compensation program. Directs the Commissioner to: (1) enter into contracts with private nonprofit or profit-making entities that acquire pharmaceuticals and controlled substances through the salvage of shipments of such products (which would be required to return any substances acquired through salvage to the manufacturer or to destroy such products if the manufacturer could not be determined); and (2) reimburse such entities for costs incurred in complying with such requirement. Amends the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 to authorize additional appropriations. Amends the PHSA to require the Administrator to make grants and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements to provide clinical training in alcohol and drug abuse and to develop curricula and materials for such training.

Title V: Department of Defense - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to plan and execute training missions for the primary purpose of assisting civilian law enforcement agencies in connection with anti-drug activities. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 to authorize the Secretary to transfer excess communications equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies of foreign countries to assist in counter-drug activities. Authorizes the President to lease excess engineering equipment in the inventory of the Department of Defense to foreign governments to assist in anti-drug activities or in the development of their infrastructure at nominal or no cost to such governments. Authorizes the Secretary to make available logistic support to any major illicit drug producing country which has been transferred excess defense articles. Allocates funds appropriated for such support. Designates the Department of Defense as the lead agency for the detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the United States in support of civilian law enforcement agencies with responsibility for enforcing the drug laws of the United States. Title VI: International Narcotics Control - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) to: (1) authorize the President to provide narcotics-related assistance to Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru; and (2) make funds available under such Act and the Arms Export Control Act for training and equipment for law enforcement agencies or other units in such countries organized for the specific purpose of narcotics enforcement. Waives during FY 1991 provisions of the FAA and similar provisions relating to limitations on assistance to countries in default on obligations owed to the United States with respect to narcotics-related assistance for a country which is a major illicit drug-producing country because of its coca production. Authorizes the President to provide assistance under the FAA to promote the production, processing, and marketing of products which can be produced economically in such countries in order to reduce dependence upon the production of crops from which narcotic and psychotropic drugs are derived. Revises certain narcotics-related provisions of the FAA to: (1) authorize the use of funds for international narcotics control for defensive arming of U.S.-title aircraft used in narcotics control eradication or interdiction efforts and for persons participating in such efforts; and (2) make an exception to the provision requiring the President to withhold 50 percent of the assistance authorized and appropriated for a major drug-producing or drug-transit country pending the March 1 certification of narcotics cooperation if he determines that application of such provision would be contrary to the national interest. Restricts to aircraft procured with funds authorized to be appropriated by the International Narcotics Control chapter of the FAA the current provision that any aircraft made available to a foreign country may be made only on a lease or loan basis, unless the President waives such requirement when he determines that it is in the national interest to do so and so informs the Congress. Permits the assigning of more than six members of the armed forces to Military Assistance Groups in Bolivia and Peru. Continues for FY 1991 the waiver of the requirement under the FAA to withhold 50 percent of annual foreign aid to major drug-transit countries which meet specified requirements, such as cooperation with the United States in achieving anti-narcotics objectives. Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Secretary of State to order the surrender to a foreign country of a U.S. citizen whose extradition has been requested by such country even if the terms of the applicable treaty or convention do not obligate the United States to extradite its citizens. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to extend the Export-Import Bank's authority to finance sales of defense articles and services for anti-narcotics purposes to September 30, 1992 (currently, expires September 30, 1990). Title VII: Sanctions for Failure to Land or to Bring To - Makes it unlawful for the pilot, operator, or other person in charge of an aircraft subject to U.S. jurisdiction to refuse to obey the order of an authorized Federal law enforcement officer to land in cases involving enforcement of controlled substances or money laundering laws. Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to vessels. Establishes penalties for violation of such provisions. Specifies that any vessel or aircraft used in such a violation may be seized and forfeited. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require: (1) revocation of the registration certificate of an aircraft that refuses to land when ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer; and (2) the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to establish procedures for the owner of the aircraft to show cause why the registration should not be revoked or why it would be in the public interest to issue a new certificate of registration to be effective concurrently with the revocation which occurred by operation of law. Authorizes the Coast Guard to issue orders and make inquiries, searches, seizures, and arrests with respect to violations of U.S. laws occurring aboard any aircraft over the high seas and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. Specifies the method by which orders to land an aircraft must be communicated. Establishes a civil penalty for failure to comply with a lawful boarding or order to land. Amends the Tariff Act to: (1) authorize U.S. Customs officers to exercise their enforcement authority outside of the United States, including any location in which Customs officers are permitted to conduct inspections, examinations, or searches; and (2) provide civil penalties for failure of an aircraft to comply with Customs officer orders to land or bring to and Tariff Act provisions regarding the boarding of vessels. Title VIII: Drug Paraphernalia - Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 to provide that criminal forfeiture of drug paraphernalia will be accomplished in accordance with procedures applicable to other criminal forfeiture provisions of the CSA. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action and to seek injunctive relief and authorizes the court to assess a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for violations of the paraphernalia statute. Provides for civil forfeiture of drug paraphernalia, other property involved, and property traceable to property involved in a violation of criminal forfeiture provisions. Title IX: Protection of Witnesses, Jurors, and Court Officers - Increases penalties for obstruction of justice offenses against court officers and jurors, and for retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants. Title X: Narcotics-Related Public Corruption - Specifies that any: (1) public official who corruptly demands, seeks, or accepts anything of value in return for being influenced in the performance or non-performance of an official act or influenced to commit or aid in committing any Federal or State offense shall be guilty of a class B felony; and (2) person who corruptly gives, offers, or promises anything of value to a public official (or offers to give anything of value to any other person) with intent to influence any official act or to influence such public official to commit a Federal or State offense or to do or omit any act in violation of such official's lawful duty shall be guilty of a class B felony. Grants Federal jurisdiction over such an offense if it involves, is part of, or is intended to further or conceal the illegal possession, importation, manufacture, transportation, or distribution of a controlled substance or controlled substance analogue. Authorizes funding for undercover operations by the Department of the Treasury. Title XI: Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering - Subtitle A: Special Forfeiture Fund - Sets forth provisions with respect to the transfer of appropriations from the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund to the Special Forfeiture Fund. Authorizes such transfers on a quarterly basis (currently, at the end of each fiscal year). Subtitle B: Forfeiture Amendments - Provides that substitute assets will be forfeited by an intermediary who does not retain the laundered property if that person participates in three or more transactions involving $100,000 or more in a 12-month period. Amends the Anti-Smuggling Act of 1935 to subject trucks and private automobiles to seizure if there is a concealed compartment, whether or not there is contraband or narcotics residue. Subtitle C: Money Laundering Amendments - Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to continue the $10,000 cash transaction reporting requirement for another two years. Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (RFPA) to authorize the transfer of certain financial records to another agency if the transferring agency has reason to believe that the records are relevant to a matter within the jurisdiction of, or appropriate for analysis by, the receiving agency for law enforcement purposes. Prohibits the disclosure of the existence or terms of a geographic targeting order. Makes the RFPA inapplicable to a financial institution providing information that it has reason to believe may be relevant to a Bank Secrecy Act violation. Exempts from liability a financial institution that: (1) ceases to do business with a customer because of suspicious transactions; and (2) discloses in good faith information and records relating to a customer violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. Authorizes the warrantless search of outgoing mail at U.S. borders by the U.S. Customs Service when a customs officer has reasonable cause to suspect that there are monetary instruments being transported in such a letter. Title XII: Miscellaneous - Adds certain cocaine and drug conspiracy and attempt offenses committed by juveniles to the list of crimes authorizing prosecution as an adult if the Attorney General certifies that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case that justifies adult prosecution. Authorizes the disclosure of cable television subscriber information to a Federal grand jury.
