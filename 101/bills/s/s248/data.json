Makes ineligible for such a payment any individual who: (1) is a Government officer or employee acting in the performance of official duties; (2) failed to furnish the information to such individual's employer prior to furnishing it to law enforcement authorities (with exceptions); (3) is not the original source of the information which has been disclosed to the public; or (4) participated in the violation with respect to which payment would be made. Specifies that the failure of the Attorney General to authorize a payment shall not be subject to judicial review."
