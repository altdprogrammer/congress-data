Sets forth additional priorities in approving Scholarship Program and National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program applications. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of incentives to improve Corps recruitment and retention. Requires the Secretary to report on his evaluations of the established program to the appropriate congressional committees not later than March 1 of every even numbered year. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the administrative staff of the Corps is adequate and appropriate to administer the Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs, increasing staff if necessary. Requires the Secretary to include in the annual report to the Congress the effectiveness of maintaining or increasing the interest in and commitment of individuals in the scholarship and loan repayment programs to primary care and service to the medically underserved, and the retention rate of participants in the programs. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer funds between the Scholarship and Loan Programs as needed due to the availability of applicants. Requires the General Accounting Office to complete by January 1, 1993, an administrative review of the Corps including the administration of the Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994 for the Corps and for the Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs. Earmarks a percentage for certain fields. Replaces provisions authorizing appropriations for State loan repayment programs with a requirement that the Secretary use amounts from this authorization to carry out such State programs. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States to establish or to assist existing State Offices of Rural Health. Requires matching State funds. Sets forth the required duties of a State Office, including providing leadership and advocacy for rural residents, coordinating activities, making recommendations on quality and cost effectiveness, and cooperating with rural health research centers established under specified provisions. Provides for optional duties of the Offices. Prohibits using grant funds for certain health planning purposes such as certificate of need programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994. Makes it unlawful for any hospital to deny any authorized health care professional member of the Corps admitting privileges, as long as the member is authorized by State law to have such privileges. Expands from three-to-five to ten-to-fifty the number of grants the Secretary can make to States or private entities for home health area demonstration projects. Prescribes procedures for awarding such grants. Adds among the requirements of an applicant for a grant that: (1) the applicant include certification that the governor of the State in which the applicant resides has received a copy of such application; and (2) a certification that the governor will submit comments to the Secretary concerning such application if needed. Sets forth a certain State matching requirement. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the effectiveness of programs that receive assistance under this Act with regard to the objectives of such programs. Adds references to both M.D. and D.O. degrees to provisions relating to the provision of health services by Corps members. Sets forth conditions that allow for discharge in bankruptcy of an individual's obligation under the Corps Scholarship Program. Requires the Secretary to establish the Rural Health Care Provider Recruitment and Education Program to assist rural communities in recruiting and educating eligible individuals to serve as health care providers in such areas. Requires administration of the program through the existing grant program established by this Act. Prescribes grant eligibility requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993. Abolishes the limitation on grants that can be made to a State with respect to emergency medical services for children. (Currently, the law allows not more than four in a fiscal year.) Amends the Uniformed Services Health Professionals Revitalization Act of 1972, the Public Health Service Act, the Social Security Act, the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971, and the Head Start Act with respect to health professional shortage areas."
