Prohibits grants to establish an endowment trust fund for the Program unless such a college enters into an agreement with the Secretary of the Interior which: (1) provides for the deposit of a capital contribution by the college equal to half of each Federal contribution; and (2) provides that if the college withdraws any of its capital contributions, an amount of Federal contributions equal to twice the amount of such withdrawal shall be withdrawn."
