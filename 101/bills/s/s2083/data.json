States that the President should: (1) appoint an envoy to press for a negotiated solution to the conflict and assist in the implementation of the San Isidro de Coronado Accord; (2) support the Secretary General's positions on talks; (3) withdraw all U.S. military advisors from El Salvador; and (4) work with other Latin American governments, the Organization of American States, and the United Nations to press countries to terminate support to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and to press the FMLN to negotiate with the El Salvadoran Government. Prohibits the provision of U.S. military and economic support fund assistance to El Salvador unless: (1) the President certifies that those responsible for the murders of specified priests and civilians in El Salvador have been apprehended, the El Salvadoran Government guarantees certain freedoms and human rights and removes from the security and military forces any officer responsible for the murders of El Salvadoran or American citizens, and the El Salvadoran Government reconstitutes the police force as a civilian force and is engaged in good faith efforts to achieve a negotiated political settlement; (2) the President submits a budget request for such assistance; and (3) the Congress authorizes such assistance. Exempts from such prohibition economic assistance channeled through El Salvadoran churches or private voluntary humanitarian organizations."
