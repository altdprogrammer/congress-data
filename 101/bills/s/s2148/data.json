    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny tax-exempt status for an organization: (1) which devotes any of its operating budget to voter registration, get-out-the-vote campaigns, or participation in political campaign activities; and (2) on whose behalf a candidate or an authorized committee thereof solicits contributions. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) impose Federal limits on contributions to political organizations maintained by a candidate for Federal office which are not political committees of a national, State, or local political party; and (2) prohibit any intermediary or conduit from delivering or arranging to have delivered contributions from more than two persons who are employees of the same employer or members of the same labor organization. Voter registration Makes it unlawful for national banks, corporations, and labor organizations to make campaign contributions or expenditures to a political organization of a candidate (unless it is an authorized committee)."
