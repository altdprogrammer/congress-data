    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to require Federal Prison Industries (FPI) to enter an industry only if private firms in such industry have at the four-digit standard Industrial Classification Code level: (1) at least 15 production workers per million dollars of value added; (2) at least ten production workers per million dollars of shipments value; and (3) no more than $18,000 in production wages per production worker, as measured in 1987 dollars. Directs FPI, when considering alternative labor-intensive industries suitable for market entry or expansion, to first enter or expand market share in the industry in which capital investment will create the largest number of jobs for Federal prisoners."
