    "text": "Department of Defense Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1991 - Earmarks specified drug interdiction and counterdrug activities funds authorized for FY 1991 for activities in the following areas: (1) operations and maintenance; (2) procurement; (3) National Guard Bureau pay and allowances; (4) research, development, test, and evaluation; and (5) minor construction. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide support to such activities in other Federal departments and agencies if requested and if funds are available. Provides purposes and activities for which such funding is to be utilized. Authorizes the Secretary to plan and execute otherwise valid military training or operations in order to aid civilian agencies in drug interdiction and counterdrug activities. Directs the Secretary to review the availability of equipment resulting from the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe and Asia in order to identify excess equipment that may be suitable for drug enforcement activities for transfer to State and local civilian law enforcement authorities. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must continue to emphasize the Department of Defense's (DOD) commitment to combating illegal drugs so that the entire chain of command ensures that available funds are utilized fully and effectively to maximize the military's contribution to the national counter-drug efforts. Requires a report from the General Accounting Office to the defense committees on DOD's counternarcotics budget. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study on the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing OH-58D Scout helicopters for detecting, monitoring, and conducting surveillance of the ground movements of drug smugglers along the southwest border of the United States. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service in conducting such study. Requires the Secretaries of State and Defense, in consultation with the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to report to the Congress detailing current U.S. policies, anti-narcotics enforcement activities, and associated training programs in the region of the Andes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should call for international negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on the establishment of an international strike force to counter major international drug traffickers, as proposed by Prime Minister Manley of Jamaica."
