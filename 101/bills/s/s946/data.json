    "text": "Nuclear Regulation Reorganization and Reform Act of 1989 - Title I: Reorganization and Reform of Nuclear Energy Regulation - Subtitle A: Nuclear Safety Agency - Establishes the Nuclear Safety Agency as an independent regulatory agency to succeed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Sets forth the Agency's officers and administration, including an Administrator to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Abolishes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require the Administrator of the Nuclear Safety Agency to establish one or more licensing boards to consider applications for the construction of nuclear waste repositories. Requires the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board to nominate persons for appointment to the licensing board. Subtitle B: Office of Investigations - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to establish an Office of Investigations in the Agency to investigate possible violations of nuclear energy statutes within the Administrator's enforcement purview. Requires the Assistant Administrator to report Federal criminal law violations to the Attorney General. Requires the Agency and the Attorney General to coordinate their enforcement and prosecution activities. Subtitle C: Nuclear Reactor Safety Investigations Board - Establishes the Nuclear Reactor Safety Investigations Board within the Nuclear Safety Agency to investigate independently any significant safety events arising out of activities at production or utilization facilities licensed by the Agency. Defines significant safety events which may have adverse effects on public health or safety. Requires the Board to submit a written report of its findings and recommendations to the Administrator, who must respond to such report in writing. Mandates that the Board's recommendations and the Administrator's response be made available to the public and the Congress. Sets forth the Board's investigative parameters. Requires the Board to submit an annual activities report to the Congress. Transfers those Agency functions to the Board which the Administrator determines to be appropriate, but precludes the transfer of program operating responsibilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1994. Subtitle D: Separability - Declares that the remainder of this title shall not be affected if any of its provisions or applications of its provisions is held invalid. Subtitle E: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective dates of this title. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to change the nature of the parties required to give notice of nonconformance with safety regulations and laws from firm directors and responsible individuals to firms or individuals generally. Authorizes the Administrator to issue regulations to ensure compliance with safety regulations, requiring firms to implement procedures to identify, evaluate, and report defects. Subjects regulation violators to civil penalties. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to include within the scope of security-related safeguards information any generic studies, reports, and analyses containing information that would provide substantial assistance in compromising or negating a licensee's security measures to protect nuclear material or facilities or in targeting vital plant equipment. Sets forth conditions under which the Secretary may accept for storage any low-level radioactive waste with radionuclides exceeding the Class C limits that is owned or generated under Agency regulations. Requires a comprehensive report to the Congress before any such waste is accepted. Mandates that such radioactive wastes be stored or disposed of only in facilities licensed by the Agency, and that federally-operated facilities for such wastes be licensed only by the Agency. Requires the Administrator to submit a quarterly report to certain congressional committees on the status of the Agency's implementation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Precludes the Nuclear Safety Agency from designating a permanent disposal site for low-level nuclear wastes in West Chicago, Illinois, until it has studied alternative sites to determine the safest one available."
