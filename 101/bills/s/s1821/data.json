    "text": "Title I: General Provisions and Policies - Indian Housing Opportunity Act of 1989 - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes of this Act. Title II: National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing - Establishes the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing to evaluate the factors impeding the development of safe and affordable housing and strategies for such development as well as for management and modernization of housing for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Requires the Commission to establish an action plan for American Indian and Alaska Native housing based upon such evaluations that: (1) specifies objectives that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) could achieve in cooperation with Indian housing authorities, Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and other interested parties; (2) provide a schedule by which such objectives could be achieved; and (3) recommend legislative, regulatory, or administrative action necessary to achieve such objectives. Directs the Commission to submit a final report to the Secretary of HUD and the Congress on its evaluations and plan within two years after appointing its members. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992. Title III: Housing Grants - American Indian and Alaska Native Housing Grant Program - Directs the Secretary of HUD, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Indian and Public Housing, to award grants to Indian tribes or Indian housing authorities to pay 80 percent of the cost of planning, developing, and implementing innovative housing programs or alternative delivery methods for meeting low- and moderate-income housing needs. Allows the use of such grants to demonstrate programs or methods for meeting the housing needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives on Indian reservations and other Indian areas. Sets forth grant recipient reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to recipients for program development. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to require the Secretary, in the event of default involving a security interest in tribal allotted or trust land, to pursue liquidation only after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian housing authority serving the tribe or tribes. Requires the Secretary, if liquidation occurs, to dispose of or alienate the property to such an entity. Title V: Authorizations - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to direct the Secretary, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts and using FY 1991 and 1992 budget authority, to reserve authority to enter into obligations for Indian public housing grants and comprehensive improvement assistance."
