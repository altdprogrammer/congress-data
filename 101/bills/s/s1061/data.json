Requires: (1) the registration under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, Rodenticide Act of such a pesticide to be treated as canceled; (2) the recall, proper storage, and disposal of the pesticide; and (3) a person who holds a registration of a pesticide containing daminozide to reimburse any person who holds any quantity of the pesticide at the prevailing sale price at the time the pesticide came into the holder's possession. Requires all existing tolerances and food additive regulations for daminozide established under specified provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to be treated as revoked. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an action level to permit distribution in commerce of food that bears daminozide residue resulting from use of a pesticide before enactment of this Act or from unavoidable residual environmental contamination occurring before enactment of this Act."
