    "text": "Biomedical and Behavioral Facilities Construction Act of 1989 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Director of Research Resources (Director), to award grants to public or nonprofit private institutions, under provisions relating to biomedical and behavioral research facilities, to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or construct new research facilities. Establishes in the Division of Research Resources of the NIH a Technical Review Board on Biomedical and Behavioral Research Facilities to: (1) advise the Director and the Advisory Council (established under existing law) on matters concerning the construction of facilities; and (2) conduct the peer review of applications under this title. Sets forth requirements for application and selection of grants. Limits the amount of any grant to 50 percent of the cost of construction or, in the case of a multipurpose facility, 50 percent of the cost of construction proportionate to the contemplated use. Allows the Director to waive these limitations for institutions of emerging excellence in biomedical or behavioral research. Provides for recapture of payments in certain circumstances for 20 years after completion of construction. Requires the Director to prescribe regulations with respect to the grants. Requires the Director to mandate peer review of applications for grants under these provisions in accordance with existing peer review provisions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
