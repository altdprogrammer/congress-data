Refers to such services as qualifed mental health professionals services. Sets the Medicare payment for such services at 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for such services or the amount determined pursuant to a fee schedule established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Requires that payment for mental health professionals services be made only on an assignment-related basis. Extends covered partial hospitalization services to include psychologist and mental health professional services prescribed by a physician and provided by a community mental health center to its outpatients as distinct and organized intensive ambulatory treatment services offering less than 24-hour daily care."
