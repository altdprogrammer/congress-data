Increases the permissible maximum deficit amounts for FY 1990 through 1992. Establishes allowable maximum deficits for FY 1993 and 1996, to reach zero with respect to FY 1997. Prohibits the Congress from considering legislation that: (1) includes the reserves of the social security trust funds in deficit calculations; or (2) modifies current law with respect to the use of such reserves."
