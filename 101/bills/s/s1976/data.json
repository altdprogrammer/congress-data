    "text": "Department of Energy High-Performance Computing Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a High-Performance Computing Program and a management plan to carry it out. Directs the Secretary to create a high-performance computer network to be known as the National Research and Education Network which shall meet certain requirements, including: (1) have a multi-gigabit-per-second data transmission capacity; (2) enable government, industry, educational institutions, and others to link together; (3) be operational by the end of 1996; and (4) be eliminated or sold to the private sector when no longer needed. Directs the Secretary to promote education and research in high-performance computational science and related fields that require the application of high-performance computing resources by making the Department of Energy's computing resources more available to undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty from the Nation's educational institutions. Directs the Secretary to establish at least two collaborative consortia to undertake research, development, testing, and the dissemination of information with regard to high-performance computing hardware and associated software and networking technology. Requires each consortium to be comprised of a lead institution which is a DOE-owned national laboratory with experience in applications requiring high-performance computing resources. Establishes a Federal Interagency High-Performance Computing Task Force to: (1) develop a government-wide high-performance computing strategy; (2) bring about the maximum efficient use of available Federal high-performance computing resources by Federal agencies; and (3) coordinate Federal agencies' policies and activities with respect to such resources. Requires the strategy to identify and recommend maximum efficiency utilization elements for Federal activities, including who outside the Federal Government should have access to Federal high-performance computing facilities and the terms and conditions of such access. Directs the Chairman of the Task Force to establish a private sector advisory panel. Requires the Task Force to issue annual progress reports. Requires Government and private-sector cooperation in carrying out this Act. Sets forth provisions governing the title to inventions and creations produced or discovered as a result of research and development under this Act. Provides for the confidentiality of trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information. Directs the Secretary to protect such information for up to five years after development. Authorizes appropriations."
