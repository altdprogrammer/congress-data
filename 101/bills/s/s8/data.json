    "text": "Chemical and Biological Weapons Control Act - Declares that it should be U.S. policy to: (1) discourage the proliferation of the material and technology necessary to produce or deliver chemical or biological weapons; (2) discourage Communist-bloc countries from aiding and abetting any states from acquiring such material or technology; (3) implement a U.S. control regime for U.S. materials, equipment, and technology that would assist the ability of a foreign country to produce or deliver chemical or biological weapons; (4) discourage private companies in non-Communist countries from aiding and abetting any states in acquiring such material and technology; (5) pursue multilateral efforts to control such weapons; and (6) take unilateral actions, where necessary, to pursue these objectives. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to require the Secretary of Commerce to maintain lists of: (1) goods or technology that would assist a country in acquiring the ability to produce or deliver chemical or biological weapons; and (2) those foreign countries which are pursuing or expanding such ability, as determined by the President. Directs the Secretary to require a validated license for any export of listed goods or technology. Requires the denial of any application for such a license if there is reason to believe that the goods or technology will be used by a listed country in producing or delivering chemical or biological weapons. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of State (and with the Secretary of Defense in the case of military items) prior to the approval or denial of an application for the export of such goods or technology. Requires the President to submit a report to the Congress every 180 days on the efforts of all foreign countries to acquire the material and technology to produce and deliver chemical and biological weapons, together with an assessment of their present and future capability to produce and deliver such weapons and to what degree any Communist-bloc country has aided or abetted any foreign country in its efforts to acquire such material or technology. Directs the President to apply sanctions to any foreign company which has assisted, or which continues to assist, any listed country in acquiring goods or technology used in producing or delivering chemical or biological weapons. Specifies such sanctions as prohibitions on: (1) the contracting with, or procuring goods or services from, any such foreign company by the U.S. Government; and (2) the importation into the United States of any products produced by such a foreign company. States that such sanctions shall remain in effect for two years after the President certifies that: (1) the foreign company has ceased to aid or abet foreign countries; and (2) it would be in the national interest of the United States to contract with, or procure goods or services from, such foreign company. Allows certain exceptions to such sanctions. Requires a review of the full range of U.S. security, political, and commercial relations with any country named in the presidential report required by this Act."
