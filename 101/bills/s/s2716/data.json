Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) contract with other water agencies for the storage and transportation of water for irrigation districts; and (2) cooperate with other water agencies in the construction of reservoirs and canals for irrigation purposes. Expands the purposes for which excess storage or carrying capacity in reclamation projects may be used to include municipal, industrial, domestic, or miscellaneous purposes, including fish and wildlife purposes, as well as for irrigation purposes. Specifies that water shall not be furnished for irrigation uses from any reservoir or canal in excess of the amount sufficient to irrigate that landowner's ownership entitlement under Federal law."
