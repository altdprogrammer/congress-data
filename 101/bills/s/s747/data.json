Specifies firearms to be included as assault weapons. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to recommend to the Congress the addition or deletion of firearms to be designated as assault weapons. Increases the length of imprisonment for an individual who uses or carries an assault weapon during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Prohibits the sale, shipment, or delivery (or purchase, possession, or acceptance of delivery) of an assault weapon to (or by) any person who does not fill out a specified form. Establishes recordkeeping requirements for purchases of assault weapons from anyone other than a dealer. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the request and delivery of such form. Sets penalties for failure to acquire such form with respect to the transfer, receipt, or possession of any assault weapon. Imposes penalties for: (1) stealing any firearm moving in interstate or foreign commerce; and (2) smuggling a firearm into the United States with intent to engage in, or promote, certain controlled substance offenses or crimes of violence. Provides for mandatory revocation of supervised release for possession of a firearm where a condition of such release was that the defendant refrain from possessing a firearm.
