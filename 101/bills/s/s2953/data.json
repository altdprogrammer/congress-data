    "text": "Trawlers Relief and Working Livelihood Act of 1990 - Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce, notwithstanding any other provision of law, from restricting the taking of shrimp within the Exclusive Economic Zone or inland waters of the United States beyond the restrictions in effect as of enactment of this Act. Continues the prohibition until 90 days after the Secretary submits to the Congress findings regarding the need for additional restrictions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit of a specified percentage of the sales of shrimp caught using a trawl net when use of a turtle excluder device (TED) was required by Federal law. Declares that, notwithstanding any provision of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), no person shall be subject under the ESA to criminal penalties relating to the use of TEDs. Directs the Secretary, through the National Marine Fisheries Services, to implement a comprehensive headstart program involving the taking of eggs of all endangered and threatened species of sea turtles found in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic seaboard for hatching in captivity and return to the wild within one year. Directs the Secretary to construct captive maintenance facilities as necessary and ensure that the facilities include sufficient professional scientific staffs. Authorizes appropriations."
