Declares that the filing of a bankruptcy petition will not act as an automatic stay of specified actions taken by either the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or the Secretary of Agriculture to protect their financial positions with respect to certain multifamily housing units whose mortgagors are in default. Exempts from the automatic stay a hospital or nursing home that is subject to a lien insured or held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to the National Housing Act."
