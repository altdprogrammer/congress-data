Applies a comparable exclusion with respect to the discharge of qualified farm indebtedness of solvent farmers who meet these requirements and whose indebtedness both before and after the relevant transfer equals at least 70 percent or more of equity. Permits both tax exclusions retroactively with respect to taxable years 1987 and thereafter."
