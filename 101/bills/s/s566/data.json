    "text": "Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act - Title I: General Provisions and Policies - Affirms the national goal that every American family should be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment. States that the objective of national housing policy shall be to reaffirm the long-established national commitment to decent, safe, and sanitary housing by strengthening a nationwide partnership of public and private institutions capable of carrying out such policy. Prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) from providing assistance to a jurisdiction unless it submits for the Secretary's approval a comprehensive housing affordability strategy. Requires public participation in the development of such strategy. Directs the Secretary to promulgate new construction energy standards for public and assisted housing and single-family and multifamily residential housing subject to mortgages under the National Housing Act. Requires such standards to meet or exceed the most recent edition of the Model Energy Code of the Council of American Building Officials. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) capacity to carry out the provisions of this Act. Title II: Investment in Affordable Housing - HOME Investment Partnerships Act - Authorizes FY 1991 and 1992 appropriations for activities under this title, with specified amounts obligated for community housing partnerships and State and local housing strategies. Subtitle A: HOME Investment Partnerships - Authorizes the Secretary to make incentive funds available to develop and support affordable rental housing and homeownership. Gives preference to housing rehabilitation rather than new construction unless rehabilitation in a particular jurisdiction would not be cost effective and existing housing stocks are inadequate. Authorizes new construction only if the Secretary determines that in a local market area there is an inadequate supply of low cost rental housing and there exists a severe shortage of residential units suitable for rehabilitation as affordable rental units. Permits a jurisdiction, under specified conditions, to undertake new construction without regard to such requirements in the case of: (1) a low- and moderate-income neighborhood revitalization plan; or (2) special needs housing (large families, persons with disabilities, or single room occupancy). Authorizes a jurisdiction to provide tenant-based rental assistance only if: (1) such assistance is an essential element of its housing strategy; and (2) assistance is provided to persons from section 8 assistance waiting lists in accordance with applicable preferences. Sets forth: (1) prohibited uses of such assistance; and (2) cost limits. Directs the Secretary to develop model programs to carry out the purposes of this title. Requires participating jurisdictions to target assistance to very low- and low-income housing that qualifies as affordable housing. Defines affordable rental housing as housing that: (1) is occupied only by low-income families; (2) is available to persons with vouchers or certificates under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; (3) will remain affordable for the useful life of the property without regard to mortgage term or ownership transfer; (4) if newly constructed, meets specified energy efficiency standards; and (5) has rents and very low-income occupancy rates at specified levels, including qualifying mixed-income projects. Defines affordable homeownership as housing that: (1) has an initial purchase price not above 95 percent of the local median purchase price; (2) is the principal residence of a low-income family purchaser; (3) is made available for initial purchase only to first-time homebuyers; (4) is made available for subsequent purchase to low-income purchasers and at a price consistent with specified guidelines; and (5) if newly constructed, meets specified energy efficiency guidelines. Provides for State and local participation on an allocation formula basis, which shall include: (1) initial fund allocations of 40 percent to States and 60 percent to local governments; (2) a one percent set-aside for Indian tribes; (3) specified FY 1991 and 1992 set-asides for rental unit new construction or rehabilitation; (4) establishment by the Secretary of a basic allocation (and reallocation) formula; (5) minimum $3,000,000 State allocations, with a $500,000 increase if no local government allocations are made in the State; (6) local allocations to only those jurisdictions that qualify for at least a $500,000 allocation; and (7) reallocation criteria. Directs the Secretary to establish a HOME Investment Trust Fund and line of credit for each participating jurisdiction. Requires participating jurisdictions to make matching payments as follows: (1) 25 percent for rental assistance and housing rehabilitation; (2) 33 percent for substantial rehabilitation; and (3) 50 percent for new construction. Permits specified matching requirement reductions for up to three years as necessary. Requires participating jurisdictions to maximize private sector participation. Requires line of credit reductions in cases of funds misuse. Sets forth tenant and participant protections including: (1) minimum one-year leases unless mutually agreed otherwise; (2) 30-day notice of termination of tenancy; (3) property maintenance; and (4) tenant selection. Requires participating jurisdictions to monitor program compliance. Subtitle B: Community Housing Partnership - Requires participating jurisdictions, for an 18-month period after funds are made available, to set aside at least 15 percent of allocations for community housing development organizations. Authorizes the use of such funds for housing and investment purposes, with up to ten percent available for project-specific technical assistance and site control loans or seed money loans. Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance for housing education and organizational support, including management training, benevolent loan funds, and community development banks and credit unions. Limits annual amounts that may go to any one contractor to not more than 20 percent of total appropriations. Makes at least 40 percent of funds available for single-State contractors. Subtitle C: Other Support for State and Local Housing Strategies - Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts (three-year maximum) with participating jurisdictions, profit and nonprofit organizations, and State and local housing agencies to identify and provide an increased supply of affordable housing. Authorizes the Secretary to support housing affordability research. Directs the Secretary to make available, upon request of a participating jurisdiction, a list of eligible recyclable HUD properties (unoccupied with appraised value below specified levels) within such jurisdiction. Subtitle D: Specified Model Programs - Sets forth the following model programs under this Act: (1) rental housing production, including repayable advances for construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation costs; (2) rehabilitation of privately owned rental housing; (3) rehabilitation loans for low- and moderate-income single family and multifamily properties; (4) sweat equity program for low- and very low-income families, including the homeless; (5) home repair services grants for low-income older or disabled homeowners; (6) low-income housing conservation and efficiency grant programs; (7) second mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, including homeownership counseling and payment deferral; and (8) rehabilitation of State and local government in rem properties. Subtitle E: Mortgage Credit Enhancement - Directs the Comptroller General to carry out a study of mortgage credit enhancement within the context of housing affordability. Subtitle F: General Provisions - Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) minority and women outreach requirements; (2) nondiscrimination; (3) annual audits; (4) recordkeeping and reports to the Congress; (5) citizen participation; (6) labor; (7) interstate agreements; and (8) environmental review. Terminates, after October 1, 1991, new grant or loan authority under the following housing programs: (1) section 17 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (housing development action grants); (2) section 312 of the Housing Act of 1964 (urban renewal rehabilitation); (3) title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Nehemiah housing opportunity grants); (4) section 8(e)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (moderate rehabilitation), except for certain single room occupancy dwellings; and (5) section 810 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (urban homesteading). Title III: Homeownership - Subtitle A: National Homeownership Trust Demonstration - National Homeownership Trust Act - Establishes in HUD the National Homeownership Trust to assist first-time homebuyers through interest rate buydowns and downpayment assistance. Makes assistance available to individuals who have not owned a principal residence within three years, displaced homemakers, or single parents. Sets maximum homebuyer income levels at 95 percent of area median income, or 115 percent in a high-cost area. Requires a minimum one percent homebuyer downpayment. Sets the maximum mortgage amount at National Housing Act levels. Provides for repayment upon: (1) sale; (2) increased income; or (3) failure of property to be used as a principal residence. Establishes in the Treasury the National Housing Trust Fund, which shall terminate on September 30, 1993. Requires the Secretary to carry out the following demonstration programs using not more than $20,000,000 from the Fund: (1) rehabilitation of two vacant structures in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; (2) purchase and renovation of vacant public and private housing for resale or rent in Washington, D.C.; (3) assistance to a community development corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and (4) other projects as may be determined. Subtitle B: FHA and Secondary Mortgage Market - Amends the National Housing Act to authorize specified FY 1991 and 1992 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance authority. Makes the increased 185 percent mortgage limit permanent. Authorizes direct endorsement mortgagees to contract for appraisal services. Limits the insured principal to 98.75 percent of the appraised value of a property (97.75 percent if the appraised value exceeds $50,000), plus the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured. Revises mortgage insurance premium provisions to require the Secretary, on mortgages for one-to-four family homes executed on or after October 1, 1994, to collect a single premium payment of 2.25 percent of the insured principal, and annual premium payments of .5 percent of the remaining balance. Sets forth 1991 and 1992, and 1993 and 1994 transitional provisions. Prohibits FHA mortgages of secondary residences unless the Secretary determines such a mortgage would be necessary to avoid undue hardship to the mortgagor. Prohibits FHA mortgages for vacation homes. Provides mortgage counseling to delinquent FHA mortgagors. Requires the Secretary to implement a delegated mortgage processing system. Requires disclosure of interest due upon mortgage prepayment. Prohibits FHA mortgagees from varying mortgage costs and interest rates by more than two percent in a given area. States that any such variations shall be based on mortgagee fees or costs (not on the basis of the loan amount). Directs the Secretary to consider the actuarial status of the entire Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund in determining whether there is a surplus for mortgagor distributions. Directs the Secretary to: (1) insure that such Fund attains specified capital ratios (1.25 percent within 24 months, two percent within ten years); (2) conduct Fund audits and report to the Congress annually; and (3) adjust programs as necessary. Includes the Virgin Islands among high-cost FHA insurance areas. Increases the number of insurable mortgages to 25,000 under the home equity conversion demonstration program for elderly homeowners. Extends such program through September 30, 1995. Directs the Secretary to collect and maintain information on early defaults and foreclosures of FHA insured mortgages, including mortgage lender analysis information. Requires the Secretary to arrange for the sale of multifamily mortgage loans through auction (rather than through acceptance of such mortgages and the giving of a bond to the original holders) through September 30, 1995. Disapproves, and prohibits the Secretary from implementing, a certain HUD regulation regarding property disposition.
