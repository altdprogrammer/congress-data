    "text": "Drug Dependent Offender Rehabilitation Act of 1989 - Authorizes appropriations to the Federal Prison System for FY 1990 through 1992 for substance abuse treatment services, including the hiring and training of staff and intensive supervision of drug dependent offenders while they are on parole or supervised release. Requires the Bureau of Prisons to separate drug dependent offenders undergoing treatment from the general prison population and avoid returning such offenders to the general prison population after the completion of the treatment program. Authorizes the sentencing court to modify the term of imprisonment of a qualified drug dependent offender by reducing the period of incarceration by not more than one year and imposing a one year period of supervised release, or extending such release by one year if already imposed. Sets forth criteria by which to qualify for such early supervised release, based on the period of incarceration, the charge for which the offender has been convicted, the sentence, successful completion of an approved substance abuse treatment program, and the approval of the sentencing judge (acting upon the recommendation of the administrator of such treatment program). Sets conditions for supervised release, including: (1) intensive counseling and supervision at a half-way house for six months after release; and (2) submitting to periodic urine drug testing, regularly attending support group meetings, and participation in an outpatient substance abuse counseling program for one year after release. Specifies circumstances for revocation of release based on testing positive for illegal use of a controlled substance. Establishes requirements for urine drug testing, including chain of custody procedures, procedures for reconfirmation of an initially positive testing using gas chromatography or equally accurate techniques, and recordkeeping and confidentiality provisions."
