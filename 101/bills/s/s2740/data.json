Authorizes the Secretary to convey certain Oakland Inner Harbor Tidal Canal property in Oakland, California, to the cities of Oakland and Alameda, California, under specified terms and conditions. Title III: Generally Applicable Provisions - Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to treat as construction the costs of planning and engineering of projects for which non-Federal interests contributed 50 percent or more of the cost of the feasibility study. Includes preparation for emergency response to any natural disaster (currently, flood emergency preparation only) with actions for which emergency response funds are authorized to be used. Authorizes the use of such funds for certain emergency dredging. Authorizes the Secretary to complete and transmit to the appropriate non-Federal interest any study for improvement to harbors or inland harbors initiated pursuant to the River and Harbor Act of 1960 or, upon request, to terminate such study and transmit the partially-completed study to the non-Federal interest.

Provides annual funding for such modification projects. Outlines procedures for the determination of a non-Federal interest's ability to pay the costs of flood control or agricultural water supply. Directs the Secretary to include environmental protection as one of the primary missions of the Corps of Engineers in planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining water resources projects. Establishes as part of the Corps of Engineers water resources development program an interim goal of no overall net loss of the Nation's remaining wetlands base, and a long-term goal of increasing the quality and quantity of wetlands in the United States. Outlines goals and an action plan for the development and restoration of wetlands. Authorizes the Secretary to establish and carry out a program to evaluate and demonstrate the use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment, as well as methods by which such projects contribute to meeting the objectives of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.

Requires a cost-sharing report and regulations in connection with such projects.
