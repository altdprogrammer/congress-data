Requires such facilities and providers to assure such beneficiary that he or she will not be penalized for refusing consent to the provision or utilization of reprocessed devices and supplies and that nonreprocessed devices and supplies will be available. Requires that such beneficiary be informed of available Medicare grievance mechanisms. Freezes the base payment rate for routine dialysis treatment in renal dialysis facilities for FY 1990. Directs the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission to conduct a study and report to specified congressional committees by June 1, 1990, concerning the appropriate payment rates for renal dialysis services in FY 1991."
