Directs the Secretary of Education to allot program grant funds to each State on the basis of school-age population. Directs State Governors to appoint Selection Review Panels to select fellowship recipients according to specified guidelines. Requires that recipients be interested in teaching careers and agree to teach in areas of the State or in fields of study with a shortage of elementary or secondary school teachers. Limits each such fellowship to not more than: (1) $5,000 for each year of graduate education in preparation to become an elementary or secondary school teacher; and (2) two years of such graduate education. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992 to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to award up to 5,000 fellowships during each of those fiscal years."
