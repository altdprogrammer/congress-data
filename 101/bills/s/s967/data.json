Sets forth the duties of the lead trustee. Establishes an ocean and coastal resource fund for damage assessment and resource restoration, acquisition, and planning. Requires sums recovered by the Federal Government for destruction or loss of, or injury to, such resources to be deposited in such fund. Authorizes appropriations necessary to maintain such fund at a level of $10,000,000. Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries whenever the balance of the fund is less than $5,000,000 and to recommend a supplemental appropriation. Provides for transfers of fund moneys to miscellaneous Treasury Department receipts whenever the balance of such fund exceeds $10,000,000."
