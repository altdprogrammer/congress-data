    "text": "Rural Bus Services Act - Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to make grants for: (1) intercity bus service; and (2) the establishment and maintenance of rural feeder services for residents of rural and urban areas designated by the Bureau of the Census with populations of 5,000 or more which are not within an urbanized area. Modifies the funding formula for rural programs. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish pilot projects to provide incentives for rural feeder services to combine express pickup and small package delivery with passenger transportation; and (2) make grants for such projects. Sets a termination date for such grants. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress the results of a study evaluating the extent to which small package pickup and delivery is dependent upon Federal preemption of State regulation."
