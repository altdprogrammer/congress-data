Requires the Secretary to study measures that will provide the safe transportation of food and hazardous materials. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress a report containing results of such study. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties. Empowers the Attorney General, at the Secretary's request, to bring action in U.S. district court for equitable relief to redress any violation of this Act or any regulations issued under it."
