Extends direct Medicare coverage to cover services furnished by marriage and family therapists, psychiatric nurses, and clinical mental health counselors on-site at a community mental health center or necessarily furnished off-site due to the condition of the service recipient. Refers to such services as qualified mental health professionals services. Sets the Medicare payment for such services at 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for such services or the amount determined pursuant to a fee schedule established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Requires that payment for mental health professionals services be made only on an assignment-related basis."
