    "text": "Access to Education Act of 1989 - Title I: Access and Choice in Federal Education Programs - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Children) the use of certain special education financial assistance funds for innovative projects to provide continued services to eligible children transferred to ineligible areas as part of an open enrollment public school system. Allows a local educational agency to provide basic program services to educationally deprived children who, under a desegregation plan or open enrollment system, attend a school not located in an eligible school attendance area. Requires that information on basic program services under an open enrollment system be provided to parents of eligible children. Allows the use of local targeted assistance program funds for the planning and implementation of open enrollment systems. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish special rules for Pell grant, supplemental educational opportunity grant, and State student incentive grant eligibility of secondary school open enrollment participants enrolled in or accepted for classes offered by higher education institutions. Amends the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 to provide for parental choice open enrollment for overseas military dependents. Title II: Demonstration Projects and Research - Authorizes the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make grants to State educational agencies to develop and expand policies, programs, and projects that increase opportunities of parents to select the public school or program attended by their children, particularly disadvantaged, minority, or rural area children. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local educational agencies or consortia for open enrollment demonstration projects that increase parental access to excellent, distinctive, and diverse schools or programs that can meet their children's educational needs and promote parental choice. Provides for research and dissemination of results on open enrollment systems. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for FY 1990 through 1995."
