Prohibits any loss resulting from disallowance of such a deduction from being offset by the net operating loss deduction. Transfers the revenue resulting from the disallowance to an account made available for subsequent transfer to: (1) the revolving fund under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for expenses related to removal of discharged oil; or (2) the Hazardous Substance Superfund. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) report to specified congressional committees an estimate of the decrease of Federal revenues between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 1988, by reason of the allowance of applicable cleanup costs; and (2) report annually to the same committees the amount expended on environmental cleanup costs and the amount accruing to the new cleanup account."
