    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-02-20", 
    "text": "Agricultural Trade Promotion Act of 1990 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to declare that with respect to the Commodity Credit Corporation program for the development of foreign markets for U.S. agricultural products, the Secretary of Agriculture shall require the U.S. exporter, user, or processor, or foreign purchaser of such products to submit evidence of the sales contract for their purchase. Requires the Secretary to take the freight costs of such products into consideration when carrying out such program. Extends the program through FY 1995 and sets new funding levels. Extends the targeted export assistance program through FY 1995. Requires the Secretary or the Corporation to provide such assistance on a priority basis with respect to agricultural commodities that have received a favorable decision under the Trade Act of 1974 with regard to unfair foreign trade practices or products adversely affected by retaliatory actions related to a favorable decision. Sets forth additional considerations in the provision of export assistance, cash contribution requirements for recipients, and fund expenditure evaluation requirements. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the cooperator market development program of the Foreign Agricultural Service should be continued; (2) such program should be funded at a certain level through FY 1995; and (3) the Service should give high priority to market development in Eastern Europe. Sets forth: (1) factors the Corporation shall take into account in making short-term export credit guarantees; and (2) minimum guarantee levels through FY 1995. Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to set forth eligibility criteria for short- or intermediate-term export credit guarantees. Amends the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 to extend through FY 1995 the Secretary of Agriculture's mandate to purchase sunflower seed oil and cottonseed oil for export sales at competitive prices. Allows producers of wheat or feed grains, under certain circumstances, to repay price support loans at a lower loan rate or the prevailing world market price of such crops. Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to extend the Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund through FY 1995. Directs the Corporation to provide a program where commercial export credit guarantees are blended with direct credits from it to reduce the effective interest rate on export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to emerging democratic nations. Authorizes funding for such program through FY 1995. Directs the Secretary to establish a fellowship program for persons from middle-income countries and emerging democracies who specialize in agriculture for study in the United States. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to make middle-income countries and emerging democracies eligible for assistance to help increase their food production under the farmer-to-farmer program. Declares it to be the policy of the United States: (1) to foster the export of agricultural commodities and their products; (2) not to restrict the export of such commodities except under compelling circumstances; (3) that any prohibition on the export of such commodities should be imposed only in time of a national emergency; and (4) that contracts for the export of such commodities entered into before imposition of such prohibition should not be abrogated."
