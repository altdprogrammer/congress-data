    "text": "Satellite Security Act of 1989 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should conduct good faith negotiations with the Soviet Union toward achieving an agreement that provides for: (1) the strictest possible limitations on the development, testing, production, and deployment of antisatellite weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union; (2) the dismantling of existing Soviet antisatellite weapons; and (3) verification of compliance with the agreement. Prohibits funds made available under any Act of Congress from being obligated or expended to test any antisatellite weapons until the President certifies to the Congress: (1) that the Soviet Union has conducted such a test since August 1982; (2) that the President has requested and the Soviet Union has refused to permit the United States to verify antisatellite weapons testing at Soviet laser testing sites; or (3) that the President has attempted and the Soviet Union has refused to negotiate concerning limitations on antisatellite weapons. Requires the President to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the capabilities of the United States to survive antisatellite attacks; and (2) the capabilities of the United States to monitor and verify Soviet development, testing, production, and deployment of such weapons."
