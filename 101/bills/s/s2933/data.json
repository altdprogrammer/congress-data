    "text": "Negotiated Rates Equity Act of 1990 - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to find that it would be an unreasonable practice for a motor common carrier (except household goods motor carriers) to collect tariff rates or charges in addition to those originally billed and collected, or to impose rules or classifications permitting such collection. Shortens the statute of limitations for the filing of claims: (1) by a motor common carrier for recovery of transportation or service charges; and (2) by a person to recover overcharges by a motor carrier. Decreases the limitation period for both kinds of claims from 36 months to: (1) 24 months for claim accruals during the year following enactment on this Act; and (2) 18 months for claim accruals on or after one year following enactment. Permits motor carriers and shippers to resolve by mutual consent, subject to Commission review and approval, any overcharge and undercharge claims resulting from billing errors or incorrect tariff provisions arising from the inadvertent failure to properly and timely file and maintain agreed upon rates, rules, or classifications. Authorizes States to waive commercial drivers' license requirements under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 for vehicles used to transport farm supplies from retail dealers to or from a farm, and vehicles used for custom harvesting, whether or not such vehicles are controlled and operated by a farmer."
