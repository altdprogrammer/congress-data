Provides for the establishment of a Strategic Drug Intelligence Board to be responsible for the management of the Center. Specifies the composition and responsibilities of the Board. Requires the Director of National Drug Control Policy to develop and submit to the Congress a plan for the management of the Center which shall include a design and format for each of the data bases to be established by the Center. Specifies that such plan shall utilize existing intelligence resources and shall not duplicate current information systems. Requires: (1) specified agencies to participate in the establishment of the data bases and contribute data as required by the Board; and (2) the information in each data base established by the Center to be made available to appropriate representatives from participating agencies. Directs the Board to take reasonable, necessary actions to provide for physical and personnel security. Requires the Director, within a year and by March 1 of each year thereafter, to prepare and submit to the Congress a report evaluating the performance of the Center and the participation of each of the contributors of the data bases of the Center.
