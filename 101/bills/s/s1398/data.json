Prohibits the Secretary from carrying out such realignment and major mission change of any medical facility without transmitting certain reports to specified congressional committees. Allows a four-month period for congressional disapproval, by joint resolution. Requires any disapproval to be for all Commission recommendations, prohibiting deletion or amendment of individual recommendations. Establishes the Commission, specifying its composition, duties, and reporting requirements, including reporting on estimated costs and savings related to each recommended realignment or mission change. Authorizes the Commission to employ support staff. Exempts all records, documents, and other materials generated by the Commission from the Freedom of Information Act. Authorizes the Secretary to take actions to implement realignment or major mission changes, including: (1) land acquisition, construction of replacement facilities, and disposal of property; (2) subject to the availability of funds, provision of economic adjustment and community planning assistance; and (3) environmental restoration, including reducing, removing, and recycling hazardous wastes and removing unsafe buildings and debris. Sets forth additional reporting requirements. Allows the Secretary to carry out this Act without regard to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Establishes a separate fund within the Treasury to carry out the purposes of this Act. Sets forth guidelines for congressional consideration of the Commission report."
