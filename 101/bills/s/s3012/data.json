Authorizes employees of the National Transportation Safety Board to examine vessels with respect to accidents investigated by the Board. Declares that the Board shall have sole authority to determine the manner in which postaccident or reasonable suspicion toxicological testing will be conducted under this Act and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Requires the Board to maintain the confidentiality of cockpit voice recordings and transcriptions, except under certain conditions. Provides for the use of such recordings and transcriptions in judicial proceedings. Requires a specimen to be collected within four hours after an accident or incident, or as soon as otherwise practicable, whenever the Department of Transportation conducts a postaccident or postincident toxicological testing of a Department employee. Requires each Department agency head to report to the Office of the Secretary of Transportation on the length of time required to complete specimen collection related to a toxicological test. Authorizes the Board to obtain from the Secretary laboratory records of positive toxicological test of any employee reasonably associated with an accident or incident. Requires the Board to maintain the confidentiality of such records. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act with respect to certain odometer mileage disclosure requirements about the power of attorney used in the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle where its title is physically held by a lienholder. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to the Congress on the transportation of low-level radioactive waste. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) to convey to third parties any property acquired by it with respect to the provision of intercity rail passenger service, if such conveyance would further the Act's purposes. Prohibits Amtrak from discontinuing commuter rail service between Valparaiso, Indiana, and Chicago, Illinois, before May 6, 1991."
