    "text": "Defense Acquisition Improvement Act of 1990 - Title I: Defense Industrial and Technology Base - Requires the inclusion in the annual critical technologies plan of information on each program element for which funds are budgeted for the support of the development of any critical technology identified. Establishes the Critical Technologies Institute (Institute) as a federally-funded research and development center operated via a nonprofit membership corporation. Requires the Institute to: (1) survey private and Government views on each critical technology identified in the most recent report of the National Critical Technologies Panel, as well as each technology that the Institute considers critical; (2) on the basis of such surveys, identify national objectives for the research, development, and production capability of the United States with respect to such technologies, as well as the preparation of possible strategies for achieving the identified objectives; and (3) publish reports discussing such national strategies as well as their implementation. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology to sponsor the Institute to enter into an agreement with the Institute's Board of Directors to perform such functions as the Director may specify, and to permit the Institute to perform functions for member agencies of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology Policy that are consistent with their functions. Provides deadlines and funding. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, to: (1) provide centralized DOD policy guidance and direction to the military departments and defense agencies on all matters relating to manufacturing technology; and (2) direct the development and implementation of Department of Defense (DOD) plans and policies promoting the development and application of advanced technologies to manufacturing processes, tools, and equipment. Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a National Defense Manufacturing Technology Plan (Plan) to provide such guidance and policy for defense manufacturing, as well as assure its implementation by defense agencies and other related Federal agencies. Requires the Secretary to establish within DOD a consolidated Joint Manufacturing Technology Project, headed by a Director who shall be responsible for the planning and execution of all DOD activities relating to manufacturing technology except those activities specifically delegated to another agency. Requires the Secretary to enhance basic research in scientific disciplines relating to manufacturing technology by promoting research and creating technology transfer in such field. Directs the Secretary to promote the use of computer-integrated manufacturing in order to improve manufacturing quality, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce production lead times. Directs the Secretary to use manufacturing extension programs to help small manufacturers to disseminate DOD manufacturing concepts. Provides that, if the the Secretary of Commerce undertakes to develop model programs for national defense laboratories, the Secretaries of Defense and Energy shall assist such Secretary in the development and implementation of such programs. Provides, with respect to the the development and implementation of national defense laboratories, for: (1) covered model programs and their participants; (2) cooperative and joint activities by the directors of such laboratories; and (3) the use of partnership intermediaries for the performance of laboratory services. Requires reimbursement to the Secretary of Commerce for expenses incurred by such Secretary regarding such model programs, with a fiscal year limitation of $50,000. States that provisions of a contract to operate a Government-owned laboratory under a cooperative research and development agreement for the purpose of technology transfer: (1) may only include provisions specifically required or demmed necessary by the head of the agency involved; (2) cannot condition such agreements upon the issuance of agency waivers of rights to inventions and other intellectual property discovered during the research; and (3) may not operate to discourage other provisions of Federal law intended to foster technology transfer. Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the payment by DOD of independent research and development costs or bid and proposal costs. Requires that, when such costs exceed $7,000,000 to a person in a fiscal year, the Secretary and such person shall enter into an advance agreement regarding the manner and extent to which DOD may pay such costs. Authorizes changes to such price limitation to reflect changing economic indices. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense committees annually on the defense industrial base of the United States, actions taken to improve such base, and the effects of defense budgets on the ability of the base to meet national security needs. Requires inclusion of the Under Secretary's analysis of the ability of U.S. businesses to conduct research, apply technologies, and maintain and expand such industrial base when necessary. Title II: Acquisition Streamlining Initiatives - Calls for the use of multiyear defense acquisition contracts if their use will result in substantial savings of total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts. Requires multiyear contracts to be used unless the Secretary finds the use of annual contracts to be in the national interest. Requires DOD to conduct market research to determine whether nondevelopmental items (commercial products not uniquely designed for other purposes) are available or could be easily modified to meet the needs of the procuring military department or defense agency. Directs the Secretary to prescribe streamlined procedures for the acquisition of commercial products which will enhance the ability of DOD to take advantage of the competitive marketplace, short delivery time, market-driven efficiency and innovation, and high-value products that are available in the commercial market. Requires offerors of commercial products to demonstrate that their products have achieved a suitable level of market acceptance, have been satisfactorily supplied, and otherwise meet criteria prescribed by public notice and solicitation. Requires the use of past performance of products and sources as a factor in award decisions. Directs the Secretary to conduct a test program to determine the feasibility and desirability of using two sets of procedures for the procurement of commercial products by DOD. Outlines requirements of the test program. Requires each participating component to publish each list of commercial products that may be procured under the procedures established. Authorizes the participating component to solicit participation by interested persons in a list of sources to be prescribed under the test program. Requires the Secretary to prescribe procedures for a source to protest a decision not to be placed on such source list. Requires such regulations to prescribe the minimum number of qualified sources that must be included on a source list. Provides for a participating component to issue solicitations for the procurement of commercial products from the sources appearing on the list. Provides solicitation rules and procedures. Requires the Comptroller General to report to various congressional committees an evaluation of the test program. Requires the head of any participating component to make available to the Comptroller General data on contracts awarded under the test program. Requires interim and final regulations covering actions under the test program to be proposed and published by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to submit to the Congress proposed legislation regarding any provision of law that the Secretary considers an unnecessary restriction on the acquisition of commercial items. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require that the Federal Acquisition Regulation issued under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ensures that: (1) requirements of executive agencies with respect to the procurement of supplies are stated so that nondevelopmental items (commercially available, and not specially-made) may be procured; and (2) executive agencies conduct market research to determine whether nondevelopmental items are available or could be modified to meet agency needs. Requires the Regulation to include a simplified contract for the acquisition of commercial items by Federal agencies. Requires that such simplified contract be utilized to the maximum extent possible. Outlines simplified uniform contract provisions and requirements. Directs the Regulation to require contractors and subcontractors offering commercial items to submit certified cost or pricing data only when necessary to determine price reasonableness. Outlines issues to be addressed or items to be included in the revised Federal Acquisition Regulation with respect to the acquisition of nondevelopmental or commercially-available items for defense agencies. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to issue guidelines for the training by executive agencies of contracting officers, program managers, and other appropriate acquisition personnel in the acquisition of nondevelopmental items. Requires the promotion of nondevelopmental item acquisition. Requires regulations and reports in conjunction with the provisions of this section. Redefines the \"small purchase threshold\" (the price at which a purchase will still be considered a small purchase for purposes of defense acquisition policies and regulations) as $25,000, adjusted on October 1 of each year divisible by five to the amount equal to $25,000 in constant FY 1990 dollars (rounded to the nearest $1,000). Makes conforming changes to such amount in various Federal provisions and Acts concerning Government procurement generally, as well as to the Small Business Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Authorizes an Assistant Secretary of Defense performing acquisition responsibilities to serve on, and attend meetings of, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council in place of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to ensure that, before full-scale development of a major defense program is initiated, there is an acquisition strategy that includes a plan for the use of competitive alternative sources for such program and each major subsystem of such program if use of two or more sources: (1) would likely result in reduced costs and would not result in unacceptable delays; and (2) is otherwise in the national security interest of the United States. Directs the Secretary to authorize the head of a defense agency to consider life-cycle costs as a factor in determining the lowest overall cost with respect to contracts awarded without discussions. Increases from $100,000 to $500,000 the certified cost or pricing data threshold. Directs the Secretary to require a review on the reasonableness of the contract, subcontract, or pricing adjustment when cost or pricing data is not required because the expected price is not expected to exceed $500,000. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a pilot program to determine the potential for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the acquisition process in major defense acquisition programs. Authorizes the Secretary to designate no more than six major defense acquisition programs for participation in the pilot program.

Requires the Panel to secure from DOD and other departments and agencies necessary information to carry out its responsibilities. Terminates the Panel 90 days after it submits its final report to each House of the Congress and the President. Earmarks specified FY 1991 amounts appropriated to the defense agencies under this Act for the Panel's use. Authorizes the payment of overseas severance pay as an allowable defense contractor cost when it is determined that such pay is: (1) necessary to comply with laws in effect on the date of the contract award and generally applicable to businesses of such country; and (2) in the national interest of the United States. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to ensure that professional and technical services are acquired on the basis of the task to be performed rather than on the basis of the number of hours of services to be provided. Authorizes the Secretary to waive certain task order limitations on a case-by-case basis. Limits the effect of such waiver on task order increases under master agreements of a contracting activity. Title III: Acquisition Workforce - Authorizes the head of an executive agency, upon a finding that it is difficult to recruit qualified persons for appointment to a particular scientific, engineering, professional, or managerial position, to request from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) a waiver of penalties for continued Government service after retirement to any person appointed to such a position.
