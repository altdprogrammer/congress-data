Authorizes the governing body of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma to prepare a plan for the use and distribution of its funds within 180 days of this Act's enactment. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit such a plan to the Congress for approval or, if the Seminole Nation has not prepared such a plan, to prepare and submit such a plan. Specifies that any such plan shall provide that not less than 80 percent of the funds allocated to the Seminole Nation shall be set aside and programmed to serve common tribal needs, educational requirements, and such other purposes as the circumstances of the Seminole Nation may determine. Restricts per capita distributions and allows such a distribution only after a membership roll of Seminole Indians has been certified by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to implement such a plan 60 days after its submission unless the Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving it. Subjects tribal investment decisions under such plans to the approval of the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to pay the governing body of the Seminole Tribe of Florida its portion of allocated funds within 60 days after submission of an appropriate resolution by the tribal governing body. Prohibits the preparation or implementation of a distribution plan or the distribution of allocated funds to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida unless authorized by the General Council of the Miccosukee Tribe or by a referendum vote of tribal members called by the General Council. Provides for the investment of funds allocated to the independent Seminole Indians of Florida until such funds are distributed. Directs the Secretary to compile a roll of independent Seminole Indians of Florida. Requires that the funds allocated to such Indians, including all accrued interest and investment income, be distributed on a per capita basis to those enrolled. Declares that the funds allocated to each Indian tribe under this Act are to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of such tribe. Provides that except for per capita payments above $2,000, funds held in trust or distributed under this Act shall not be considered as income for purposes of any Federal program."
