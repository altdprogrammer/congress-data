Requires determinations to be made, with respect to displaced Salvadorans and Nicaraguans living in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, or Mexico, of: (1) the number and location of such persons; (2) their place of origin in El Salvador or Nicaragua and the period of, and reason for, their displacement; and (3) their current living conditions, with particular attention to questions of personal safety and the availability of food and medical assistance. Requires determinations to be made which: (1) assess conditions in El Salvador that could affect Salvadorans who have returned from the United States, including human rights violations; and (2) describe the policies of all other countries in which Salvadorans have sought refuge as these policies concern the return of Salvadorans to El Salvador. Title II: Congressional Review - Provides for the referral of such report to the appropriate congressional committees in accordance with the rules of each House for committee hearings (within 90 days of continuous session after the referral of such report) and committee reports (within 270 days of continuous session after the referral of such report). Title III: Temporary Stay of Deportation - Prohibits the Attorney General from detaining or deporting aliens until the Congress completes its review of the Comptroller General's report of those aliens who: (1) are nationals of El Salvador or Nicaragua; (2) have been continuously present in the United States since before January 1, 1989; and (3) are deportable on specified noncriminal grounds. States that the stay of deportation period shall not count as a period of physical presence in the United States for purposes of deportation suspension except in cases of extreme hardship. Requires an alien receiving a stay of deportation to register with the Immigration and Naturalization Service beginning 30 days after enactment of this Act and ending 90 days thereafter. Provides that fees shall be charged for such registration. Permits such an alien to work in the United States while in such status. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - States that during such temporary stay of deportation period an alien: (1) shall not be considered to be permanently residing in the United States; (2) shall not be eligible for Federal public assistance; and (3) may be deemed ineligible for State assistance."
