    "text": "Value-Added Agricultural Trade Act of 1990 - States that U.S. policy shall provide for increased emphasis on overseas sales of value-added agricultural products. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to take appropriate steps to implement such goal. Directs the President in determining Department of Agriculture budgets to provide special consideration for export enhancement funding based on such products' additions to Treasury revenues and the U.S. balance of payments. States that United States representatives at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations should continue to work for the elimination of agricultural trade barriers and other obstacles to U.S. sales abroad of value-added agricultural products. Directs the Secretary to provide U.S. agricultural exporters with assistance to overcome unfair foreign trade practices. Amends the Agricultural Trade and Development Assistance Act of 1954 to require that at least 75 percent of all famine relief and other donations be in the form of processed or fortified products or bagged commodities. (Currently, such requirement applies only to nonemergency programs.) Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food for Peace Act of 1966 to make short-term export credit guarantees for wood and processed wood products available under conditions comparable to other agricultural products. Authorizes appropriations."
