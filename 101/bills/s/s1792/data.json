    "text": "Amends the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 to specify that the \"net value\" rather than the \"value\" of a replacement crop shall be considered when making specified disaster payment reductions. Applies such reductions only to replanted acreage. Requires separate consideration of planted and replanted acreage in determining emergency crop loss assistance under such Act. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture in determining replacement crop value to: (1) consider only the amount of replacement crop production that is in excess of 50 percent of the county average yield for such crop; (2) base the value of the excess replacement crop production on average market prices for such crop over a representative period; (3) reduce such crop's value by 25 percent; and (4) consider historical cropping patterns. Authorizes the Secretary to make crop acreage base adjustments to reflect crop rotation practices due to natural disasters. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to: (1) revise the formula for determining farm poundage quotas for dark air-cured tobacco and fire-cured tobacco; and (2) revise the definition of \"preliminary farm yield\" for other than flue-cured tobacco. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to permit the Secretary to waive the principal due on agricultural regular or producer reserve loans in order to avoid loan collateral forfeiture."
