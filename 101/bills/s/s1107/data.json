    "text": "Tish Sommers and Laurie Shields Displaced Homemakers Training and Economic Self-Sufficiency Assistance Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to allot funds to States annually for services for displaced homemakers. Reserves a portion of such funds for national activities. Requires that such funds supplement and not supplant other Federal, State, and local public funds for such services. Sets forth reallotment procedures and requirements for State plans and State administration. Requires (if such entities do not already exist): (1) creation of a displaced homemakers unit within an appropriate State agency; (2) assignment of a full-time State administrator for displaced homemaker services to administer the program and coordinate it with other such services in the State; and (3) creation of a State displaced homemaker advisory council to assist the unit in planning, implementing, and evaluating programs and activities. Sets forth various services for which funds may be used under this Act for education, training, and supportive services for displaced homemakers. Directs State Governors to make grants, from allotments under this Act, to eligible service providers on a competitive basis, with certain priorities and special consideration. Authorizes State Governors, on a one-time basis only, to reserve ten percent of the State allotment to establish a revolving fund to provide low interest loans to displaced homemakers to pursue education, training, and employment opportunities. Directs the Secretary to implement a uniform data collection system to assist displaced homemaker services. Directs the Secretary, through the Women's Bureau, to make a grant to a national organization to provide the following for displaced homemaker services programs: (1) preservice and inservice personnel training; (2) technical assistance; and (3) establishment of a national clearinghouse to disseminate materials and information from exemplary programs. Directs the Secretary to report biennially, with recommendations, to the Congress on progress in providing training and other work-related services to displaced homemakers. Directs the Secretary to prescribe performance standards, which may be based on specified factors, for programs under this Act. Authorizes State Governors to prescribe variations on such standards, based on specified factors. Makes displaced homemakers receiving assistance under this Act ineligible for assistance under title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers) of the Job Training Partnership Act, in any fiscal year in which the appropriation for this Act equals or exceeds a specified amount. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and succeeding fiscal years. Provides for a transition to the forward funding method of timing appropriation action."
