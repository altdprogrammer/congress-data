    "text": "Advanced Nuclear Reactor Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to implement a technology research and demonstration program for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission. Mandates that such program include a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certification process for completed standard designs for commercial nuclear reactor facilities employing nuclear reactor technologies. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual status report to the Congress regarding the certification program. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress the results of public hearings held to determine specified aspects of the research and demonstration program. Sets forth guidelines under which the Secretary is authorized to: (1) encourage the siting, licensing, financing, construction, and operation of facilities for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission in regions where the Secretary finds a need for additional electric generating capacity; and (2) issue requests for implementation proposals. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1994. Requires the NRC to submit specific recommendations to the Congress for changes in the licensing requirements of commercial nuclear power reactors. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress the results of a review of commercial nuclear reactor technologies in other nations. Requests the NRC to report to the Congress on any licensing problems associated with the commercial nuclear reactor technologies identified in the Secretary's report. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual status report to the Congress regarding the research and demonstration program."
