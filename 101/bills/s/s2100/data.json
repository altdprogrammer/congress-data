    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-07-19", 
    "text": "Veterans Benefits and Health Care Amendments of 1990 - Title I: Compensation - Part A: Generally - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase the rates of, and limitations on, Department of Veterans Affairs disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation to coincide with benefit increases under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Requires such rate increases to be published in the Federal Register. Part B: Radiogenic Disabilities - Extends the presumption of service-connection, for purposes of eligibility for veterans' disability compensation, to cover members of the reserves who participated in a radiation-risk activity while serving on active duty for training or inactive duty for training. Amends Federal provisions relating to the payment of disability compensation due to certain diseases and disabilities presumed to be service-connected to remove the current limitation on the required manifestation period (either 40 or 30 years from the date on which a veteran last participated in a radiation-risk activity). Adds cancer of the salivary gland and cancer of the urinary tract to the list of diseases that will be presumed to be service-connected for purposes of such disability compensation. Requires the Secretary, within 210 days after enactment of this Act, to identify at least three military activities which likely would have exposed individuals to levels of ionizing radiation above background levels. Requires the Secretary to identify at least three additional activities by October 1 of FY 1991 through 1993. Requires the Secretary, immediately after identifying each additional activity, to direct the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards to evaluate, make findings, and report on whether participation in such activities resulted in exposure comparable to that resulting from a radiation-risk activity as defined under current law. Requires the Secretary to list each such activity unless the Advisory Committee's report and all other evidence indicate that such activity did not result in comparable exposure to that of veterans participating in radiation-risk activities. Requires the Secretary to make certain reports. Part C: Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service - Veterans' Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1990 - Establishes a presumption of service connection, for the purposes of eligibility for veterans' disability compensation, for each of the following diseases incurred by individuals who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam era, if such diseases become manifest to a disability degree of ten percent or more: (1) non-Hodgkins lymphoma; (2) each soft-tissue sarcoma; and (3) chloracne. Provides a presumption of service-connection in the case of a Vietnam veteran suffering from a disease associated with effects of exposure to certain dioxins or other herbicide agents during such service in Vietnam. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations listing a positive association between any disease and the biological effects of exposure to an herbicide agent in Vietnam. Requires the Secretary to update such list continually. Requires the Secretary, in prescribing and revising such list, to obtain by contract the determinations and estimates of a contract scientific organization. Requires such organization to: (1) determine which diseases have any degree of association with the biological effects of exposure to a herbicide agent; and (2) estimate the extent of association between each such disease and each such biological effect. Requires the organization to determine such association specifically with respect to lung cancer and each other cancer. Outlines contract provisions required in such agreements between the Secretary and the scientific organization, including surveys, evaluations, and periodic determinations. Requires such scientific organization to provide reports to the Secretary and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees) regarding its determinations and evaluations. Requires such organization to determine, in the event of a positive association, whether there is a reasonable basis for concluding that a Vietnam veteran with the highest level of exposure to that herbicide agent in Vietnam was exposed to such agent under the circumstances necessary for such biological effects. Requires a report from the organization to the Secretary and the veterans' committees when no such reasonable basis is found. Requires the Secretary to make certain determinations and follow-up reports after receiving such reports from the contract scientific organization, including the issuance of a report to the veterans' committees and the promulgation of positive association regulations, if necessary. Requires benefits to be continued even though a disease is removed from the list of diseases having positive associations. Terminates such contracting authority ten years after the first day of the fiscal year in which a scientific organization transmits its first report to the Secretary. Provides interim regulations and special effective dates. Directs the Secretary to compile and analyze all clinical data that: (1) are obtained by the VA in connection with examinations and treatment of veterans for disabilities related to exposure to certain herbicides or to service in Vietnam; and (2) are likely to be scientifically useful in determining the association, if any, between the disabilities of such veterans and their exposure to such herbicides and other toxic substances. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to the veterans' committees concerning such analysis and its results. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) before compiling and analyzing such information. Requires the Director of OTA to review each annual report submitted by the Secretary and transmit to the Secretary an evaluation of the contents of each report. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a system for the collection and storage of voluntarily contributed samples of blood and tissue of veterans who performed active service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Outlines provisions concerning the security and authorized uses of such specimens, as well as limitations on the acceptance of such samples. Requires the Secretary to consult with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to the extent that an agreement has been reached with NAS serving as the contract scientific organization for the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Director of OTA if no agreement is made with NAS. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to provide for studies of the feasibility of conducting additional scientific research on health hazards resulting from: (1) exposure to dioxin; (2) exposure to other toxic agents in herbicides used in support of U.S. and allied military operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3) active military, naval, or air service there. Requires the Secretary to report to the veterans' committees on the results of such studies. Requires the Secretary to consult with NAS before undertaking such studies and requires NAS to review such studies and report recommendations to the Secretary and the veterans' committees to the extent provided under any agreement between the Secretary and NAS. Amends the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1988 to require the Secretary to annually furnish updated information to individuals listed in the Department of Veterans Affairs Agent Orange Registry on health risks resulting from exposure to dioxin or other toxic agents in herbicides as a result of service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the veterans' committees on the research being conducted to develop treatments for psychological absorption of dioxin and other toxic agents used in herbicides by the United States in Vietnam, including research relating to exposure to dioxin and other toxic agents outside Vietnam. Extends through December 31, 1993, the eligibility for hospital and nursing home care for veterans exposed to toxic substances in Vietnam. Amends the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1988 to authorize direct consultation between the Ranch Hand Advisory Committee and Department of the Air Force scientists conducting the Ranch Hand Study (a study of the long-term health effects of exposure to phenoxy herbicides and contaminants). Requires the preparation and submission of annual reports and a final report in connection with such study. Title II: Health Care - Part A: Mental Health - Authorizes the provision of health care and services for veterans of World War I or II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Era, or any other area during a period in which hostilities occurred who have been diagnosed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder related to such services even though such disorder has not been determined to be service-connected. Requires the VA to accomplish an evaluation of a veteran within seven days after referral of such veteran to a Department health-care facility from a Vet Center (a center for treatment of veterans with mental illness disabilities). Expands eligibility for readjustment counseling at Vet Centers to include veterans of wars prior to Vietnam and veterans of service in any areas in which U.S. personnel were subjected to danger from armed conflict comparable to that occurring in battle with an enemy during a period of war. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate up to five VA health-care facilities as centers of mental illness research, education, and clinical activities, taking into account appropriate geographic distribution of such facilities. Precludes the Secretary from designating any health-care facility as a center unless the facility has (or may reasonably be anticipated to develop): (1) an arrangement with an accredited medical school or graduate school of psychology which provides education and training in psychiatry and psychology through regular rotation through such center so as to provide training in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; (2) an arrangement under which nurses, social workers, or other allied health personnel receive education and training in mental health care through regular rotation through such facility; (3) the ability to attract the participation of scientists who are capable of ingenuity and creativity in research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of mental illness and into models for furnishing care and treatment to veterans suffering from mental illness; (4) a policymaking advisory committee to advise the directors of such facility and center on policy matters pertaining to the activities of such center; and (5) the capability to conduct effectively evaluations of the activities of such center. Authorizes appropriations. Declares that activities of clinical and scientific investigation at each center shall be eligible to compete for the award of funding from funds appropriated for the Department's medical and prosthetics research account and shall receive priority insofar as funds are awarded to projects for mental illness. Requires the Chief Medical Director (CMD) to ensure that: (1) research activities carried out through such centers include an appropriate emphasis on the psychosocial dimension of mental illness and on models for furnishing care and treatment to veterans suffering from mental illness; and (2) useful information produced by the centers is disseminated throughout the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration. Requires the Secretary to submit to the veterans' committees an annual report on activities and effectiveness of the centers. Directs the Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to submit to the Secretary and veterans' committees Committees no later than February 15 of each of the years 1991 through 1993 a report on the Committee's evaluation of the results of a study required under the Veteran's Health Care Amendments of 1983 relating to the diagnosis and treatment of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Directs the Secretary to comment to the veterans' committees concerning such report. Requires the Committee to update certain reports required of the Committee under the Veterans' Health Care Act of 1984 and requires the Secretary to comment to the veterans' committees concerning such updates. Directs the Secretary, in certain papers required to be submitted to the President annually, to identify the amounts in the appropriations requests for the VA that are estimated to be obligated for payments and treatments for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and for education, training, research, and the operation of the National Center on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Part B: General Health - Authorizes the VA to furnish wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, and other medically necessary supplies and services as part of veterans' outpatient care when necessary either to obviate the need for hospital admission or in preparation for hospital admission. Provides outpatient dental care when medically necessary in preparation for hospital admission or for a veteran otherwise receiving other outpatient care or services. Increases the maximum cost limitation for the provision of certain home health care services to disabled veterans. Makes permanent the program of community-based contract veterans' alcohol and drug treatment program (currently expires September 30, 1991). Extends through FY 1995 the authority to provide contract care to U.S. veterans in the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in the Philippines. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the upgrading and replacement of equipment and facilities for such Center through FY 1995. Decreases such annual authorization amount from $1,000,000 to $500,000. Earmarks the first $50,000 of grants appropriated to the Center for educating and training hospital personnel. Authorizes VA medical centers to convert space at their facility for child care purposes, without reimbursement to the Veterans Canteen Service for the cost of such conversion. Expands the current authority of the Secretary to acquire and provide housing for homeless veterans in order to allow entities to provide transitional housing for veterans recovering from substance abuse or mental illness disabilities.
