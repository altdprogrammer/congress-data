    "text": "Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require U.S. district courts to implement a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan to facilitate adjudication, streamline discovery, improve judicial case management, and provide for just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of civil disputes. Requires district plans to be developed jointly by the bench, public, and bar and to address specified elements, including differentiated case management with explicit processing tracks, mandatory discovery-case management procedures, limitations on discovery, alternative dispute resolution, nonbinding conferences at early stages of litigation, judicial accountability procedures, and use of magistrates. Directs the Judicial Conference of the United States and the Federal Judicial Center to develop a model plan, with mandatory implementation within a year in districts not developing their own plans. Requires progress and impact reports to the Congress. Requires district courts to implement transition programs for any case backlogs and to inventory and index pending cases. Directs the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to automate the court docket in nonautomated districts. Requires: (1) the preparation of a Manual for Litigation Management which includes the rationale and impact of the plans; and (2) expansion of judicial training programs to include case management. Authorizes appropriations."
