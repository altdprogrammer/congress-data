    "text": "Foreign Representation Act of 1990 - Title I: Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 - Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to provide that a foreign principal shall be considered to control a person in major part if such principal holds at least 50 percent equitable ownership in such person. Replaces references to: (1) \"agent\" with \"representative\"; and (2) \"propaganda\" with \"promotional material.\" Requires representatives of foreign principals engaging in private and nonpolitical activities who are relying on exemptions to registration requirements to notify the Attorney General. Prescribes civil penalties for violations concerning registration statements. Grants administrative law judges subpoena power in conducting investigations with respect to such violations. Establishes within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice a section to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, provisions of the Federal criminal code added by this Act, and all other laws relating to lobbying activities in the United States. Title II: Chapter 11 of Title 18, United States Code - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the President, Vice President, specified Federal officials and members of the uniformed services, and Members of the Congress, for specified time periods after such persons' service as officials has ceased, to act as agents or attorneys for compensation, in matters in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest, for: (1) a foreign government or political party; (2) a person outside of the United States, unless such person is a U.S. citizen; or (3) a combination of persons organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a foreign country. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to the extent such official is engaging only in: (1) the soliciting or collecting of funds to be used for specified humanitarian assistance; (2) activities in furtherance of religious, charitable, scholastic, or scientific pursuits or of the fine arts; or (3) activities in furtherance of an international organization of which the United States is a member. Prescribes criminal penalties for violations of this title."
