Requires the Council to study: (1) the administration and management of the Council, including methods for determining and collecting assessments from industry members, refusal to pay assessments, and provision for accepting or rejecting members; and (2) the extent to which the industry and the Council should continue to use the existing structure, rules, and regulations under the Act regarding the Council. Requires that members of the Council remain members until a referendum is approved and a new mechanism for Council appointments is in place. Authorizes appropriations: (1) from the Fisheries Promotional Fund to carry out the annual marketing and promotion plan and annual budget of the Council; and (2) to carry out the Act. Repeals this Act effective September 30, 1993."
