Directs the Attorney General to use the authority granted under the Controlled Substances Act to enforce the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 through the use of task forces consisting of appropriate Federal, State, and local personnel. Requires any person who commits the offense specified by this Act to forfeit to the United States (later to be transferred to the State in which the offense was committed) any profits, proceeds, interest, or property acquired or maintained in violation of this Act, and any interest in, security of, claim against, or property or contractual right affording a source of influence over any enterprise operated in violation of this Act, that the sentencing court determines, after a forfeiture hearing, was acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics racketeering or violating this Act."
