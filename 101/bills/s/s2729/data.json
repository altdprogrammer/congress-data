    "text": "Coastal Barrier Resources Act Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (the Act) to replace provisions describing the properties included in the Coastal Barrier Resources System and providing for boundary modifications and maps with provisions including in the System undeveloped coastal barriers: (1) depicted on specified maps; (2) owned by the United States and meeting certain requirements; and (3) incorporated into the System under provisions of this Act. Requires the Administrator of General Services, prior to transfer or disposal of excess property that may be an undeveloped coastal barrier, to obtain from the Secretary of the Interior a determination of whether the property constitutes such a barrier. Sets forth procedures for adding such a property to the System. Directs the Secretary to provide to the Governor of each State and affected local governments on the Atlantic, Gulf, or Great Lakes costs copies of maps of the undeveloped coastal barriers owned by that State or a local government. Directs the Secretary, if a Governor elects to have any portion added to the System, to follow certain procedures for adding such portions. Sets forth procedures regarding filing, public inspection, and changing of maps. Requires review of maps: (1) on request of certain officers of States, political subdivisions, and coastal zone management agencies; and (2) at least once every seven years. Amends provisions setting forth permissible Federal expenditures affecting the System to: (1) require that expenditures for the disposal of dredge materials be consistent with the purposes of the Act; (2) require that emergency actions essential to saving lives and protecting property be subject to specified provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act regulating the amount of assistance; (3) allow expansion of a specified road in the Florida Keys; and (4) allow expenditures for the maintenance of existing channel improvements and related structures only if all, or a portion, of the moneys for the improvement or structure were appropriated before that System unit was included within the System (currently, before October 18, 1982). Requires the head of each Federal agency concerned (currently, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) to certify compliance with the Act annually to specified congressional committees and the Secretary (currently, to the House of Representatives and the Senate). Authorizes appropriations."
