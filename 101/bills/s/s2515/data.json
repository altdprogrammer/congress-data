    "text": "International Medical Graduates Anti-Discrimination Act - Amends the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a National Repository of Medical Graduate Records. Requires the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) to provide biannually to the repository the graduate educational, training, experience, and examination records of all medical graduates applying for licensing. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to certify the records and requires the records, once certified, to be recognized as official records for State purposes of awarding medical licenses, residency positions, medical staff privileges, and clinical privileges. Prohibits the Secretary from releasing records of a graduate without the written consent of the graduate. Prohibits: (1) discrimination against an international medical graduate, on the basis of the international medical degree of the graduate, in licensing, licensing by endorsement, hiring for medical staff positions, or granting clinical privileges; and (2) requiring an international graduate to provide additional information or meet additional requirements that would not be required from a graduate of a school in a State or Canada. Directs the Secretary to make available to the FSMB grants for developing and administering a single national medical licensing examination or set of examinations. Authorizes appropriations."
