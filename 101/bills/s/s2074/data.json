Requires the Management Conference to: (1) make recommendations to any commission related to the Lake; (2) make recommendations to the Administrator and the Director on the need for additional agreements between New York and Vermont; (3) contact the officials conducting studies and programs concerning the Lake; and (4) coordinate such studies and programs.
