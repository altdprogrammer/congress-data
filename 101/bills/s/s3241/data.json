Grants the President the authority to: (1) order the seizure of any such property or interest if the President determines that Iraqi control thereof might impair national security and that seizure is in the national interest; and (2) pay U.S. creditors and other holders of obligations for which Iraq has suspended payment or repayment. Directs the President to equitably distribute the funds gained from the liquidated assets among all creditors and other obligation holders, including the U.S. Government."
