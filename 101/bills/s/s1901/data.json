    "text": "Conservation Reserve Program Tree Planting Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to reduce to discretionary authority the Secretary of Agriculture's current mandate to enroll specified numbers of acres for specified years into the conservation reserve program (CRP). Waives the three-year CRP change of ownership prohibitions for land planted to trees. Permits the CRP enrollment of land that has been cropped in two of the years between 1981 and 1988 if such land is planted to trees. Directs the Secretary to offer 15-year CRP contracts for land planted to trees. Permits participants to extend existing contracts. Authorizes the Secretary to offer to convert acreage planted to grass to trees and to pay 50 percent of the cost. Authorizes the Secretary to permit participants who agree to plant CRP acreage to trees to continue to grow crops for a specified period of time. Reduces or eliminates rental payments during such period. Requires a participant who fails to properly maintain CRP trees to repay all cost-sharing assistance and forfeit any rental payments. Authorizes the Secretary to provide two additional lump-sum payments to producers who plant trees on CRP acreage."
