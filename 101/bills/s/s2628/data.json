Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations for grants under existing provisions to States for State comprehensive mental health services plans. Allows allotments to States under existing provisions to be used to develop and implement the plans. Excludes such expenditures from consideration regarding limits on administrative expenses. Changes the requirements for such plans, including: (1) replacing references to chronically mentally ill individuals with references to individuals with serious mental illnesses; and (2) adding references in selected provisions to children with serious emotional and mental disorders. Requires a State to use the State Mental Health Planning Council, or establish a new council with comparable membership requirements, to advise and review all aspects of development and implementation of the plan. Extends deadlines for: (1) implementation of State plans; and (2) reduction of allotments for failure to substantially implement the plans. Applies provisions limiting the expenditures which may be required of a State to the period covered by the plan (currently, any fiscal year) and takes into consideration savings on inpatient hospitalization from the plan. Authorizes the Administrator for Health Care Policy and Research to provide financial assistance for multidisciplinary health services research, demonstration, training, and other matters. (Current law authorizes the Administrator to provide financial assistance for such multidisciplinary matters with respect to: (1) rural areas; and (2) the health of low-income groups, minority groups, and the elderly.)"
