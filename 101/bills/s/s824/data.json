    "text": "Child Care Development Act of 1989 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992 for a child care block grant program. Requires State Governors to designate a lead State agency to administer the funds provided to the State under this Act. Requires States to use their allotments to make grants or loans to eligible providers or other eligible entities for capital expenditures, furnishings, operating expenses, and training. (Defines an eligible provider as a child care center, family day care provider, or other facility which meets requirements as determined by the Secretary or lead agency. Defines an eligible entity as any public or nonprofit private organization.) Permits States to use allotment funds to provide child care training to adult recipients of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under the Social Security Act. Sets forth requirements for State applications and State plans. Authorizes a State to require any service provider funded or seeking funds under this Act to furnish, in cash or in kind, contributions. Allows a State to transfer to the lead agency any amounts paid to it for child care services programs under the Social Security Act, the State Dependent Care Development Grants Act, and the Community Services Block Grant Act. Requires annual State reports on fund use. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to exclude child care services earnings from the limitation on wages or self-employment income for purposes of determining benefits for certain individuals. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude child care providers from the definition of private business use and from coverage by specified private activity bond provisions. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to ensure compliance with this Act. Provides for a negotiated rulemaking process. Requires a study to improve the coordination of child care funding or services programs administered by or through the Department of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary to report on such study, with recommendations, to specified congressional committees within one year after enactment of this Act. Repeals provisions for certain public works and development facility loans and grants under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Provides that all unobligated funds made available for the Appalachian Regional Development Commission and the economic development activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority shall be used to carry out this Act."
