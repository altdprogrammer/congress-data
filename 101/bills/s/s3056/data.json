    "text": "Federal Senior Citizen Personnel Support Council Act of 1990 - Establishes the Federal Senior Citizen Personnel Support Council to develop and monitor the implementation of a Government-wide Federal plan to: (1) increase the use of senior citizens as support personnel for federally sponsored programs; (2) provide for State and local government participation; (3) exchange information between Federal agencies to greater utilize the skills, training, and expertise of senior citizens in such programs; and (4) recommend any legislation necessary to remove obstacles preventing implementation of plans under this Act. Directs each Federal agency to submit to the Council a plan that: (1) applies and implements the Government-wide plan developed by the Council; (2) sets out the objectives of the agency in implementing the plan in the upcoming year; and (3) measures agency performance in meeting the objectives of the preceding year. Directs the Council to review such plans. Requires the Director of the Federal Council on Aging to oversee a special review by each Federal agency to determine the extent to which senior citizens are given an equal opportunity to participate as support personnel in Federal programs. Requires such review to examine unintended regulatory barriers, determine the adequacy of announcements of program support opportunities, and identify ways for eliminating impediments and hindrances. Authorizes appropriations."
