    "text": "International Narcotics and Terrorism Control Act of 1989 - Authorizes the President to impose additional specified transportation, immigration, and customs sanctions on certain countries if he determines that to do so would contribute to the reduction in the importation into the United States of narcotics from such countries. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that the President's annual report to the Congress on U.S. policy with respect to an international strategy to prevent the cultivation and manufacture of, and traffic in, controlled substances include: (1) comments and recommendations regarding the war on drugs by the Departments of State, Justice, Defense, the Treasury, and Health and Human Services, the Agency for International Development, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, and other enforcement agencies; and (2) the results of a review of the connections between international narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and international terrorism. Directs the Director of National Drug Control Policy to include in the National Drug Control Strategy to be submitted to the Congress on February 1, 1990: (1) a study of current Federal personnel practices affecting all persons engaged in the war on drugs; and (2) a determination as to whether adequate resources are being devoted to the hiring, training, promotion, and retention of Federal employees responsible for fighting drugs. Requires the Secretary of State to report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee not later than ten days after denying a request from a law enforcement agency for assistance by the Department of State, setting forth the reasons for such denial. Makes it unlawful for any person who was employed by the executive branch or by the Congress and who performed duties with respect to narcotics-related issues, to represent a foreign government on narcotics matters for three years after leaving such employment. Provides penalties for a violation. Requires the Secretary of State and any other officer or employee of the Department of State to submit the name of any individual or entity to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Drug Enforcement Administration for their determination that such individual or entity is not under indictment or has not been convicted of any narcotics or narcotics-related offense before they may enter into a contract on behalf of the Department with such individual or entity. States that no funds made available for the Department may be available for payment on any contract entered into with an individual or entity listed by such agency. Provides that no funds made available to any element of the U.S. Government authorized to conduct intelligence activities may be available for payment to any individual who has been convicted of narcotics trafficking or money laundering, with an exception. States that it is not a defense to prosecution for certain offenses in the Federal criminal code related to foreign relations that an individual was acting pursuant to the authority or direction of any department, agency, or officer of the U.S. Government, unless: (1) such action was taken pursuant to the specific authority or direction of the Secretary of State; and (2) the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House and the Foreign Relations Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate were notified by the Secretary within 48 hours after the conferral of such authority or the giving of such direction."
