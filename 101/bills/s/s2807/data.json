    "text": "Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to operate the Glen Canyon Dam in a manner so as to protect, mitigate adverse impacts to, and improve the conditions of the natural resources of Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon Recreation Area under operating criteria consistent with the water storage and delivery functions of the Dam. Directs the Secretary to determine whether the available scientific data is sufficient to permit the implementation of interim power operating criteria (IPOC) for the Dam that would, without impeding research, increase the protection and improvement of natural resources of the Park and the Recreation Area. Directs the Secretary to implement the IPOC if sufficient scientific data is found to exist or to take appropriate action to procure such data as quickly as possible in order to implement the IPOC. Enumerates certain objectives to be included in the IPOC implemented, including noninterference with the water storage and delivery functions of the Dam, the minimization of adverse environmental impacts of the Dam operations on the downstream Park and Recreation Area, and adjustment and monitoring of sufficient water flows downstream from the Dam. Directs the Secretary to consult with appropriate agencies of the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, the Governors of affected States, and affected Indian tribes in the development and implementation of the IPOC. Authorizes the Secretary to deviate from the IPOC if found necessary and in the public interest. Requires the Secretary to complete a final Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement within three years after enactment of this Act and, based on the statement's findings, to implement final power operating criteria that will ensure that the Dam is operated in a manner consistent with this Act. Requires the Secretary to establish and implement long-term monitoring requirements to assure that the Dam is operated in a manner consistent with the protection of the Park and the Recreation Area downstream. Authorizes appropriations."
