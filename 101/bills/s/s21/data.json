Describes procedures to govern the veto, requiring the President to send to the Congress a special veto message with respect to each rescission item within three days of the relevant law's enactment. Permits override of the veto if the Congress adopts a resolution of disapproval (subject to the same expedited procedure governing impoundment resolutions) and presents it to the President within 45 calendar days of the veto message."
