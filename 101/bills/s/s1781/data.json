Declares that the right of Native Americans to express themselves through their languages shall not be restricted in any public proceeding, including publicly supported education programs. Requires the President to direct Federal agency heads to: (1) evaluate their policies and procedures to determine and implement changes needed to bring them into compliance with this Act; and (2) evaluate the laws they administer and make recommendations to the President on amendments needed to bring such laws into compliance with this Act. Directs the President to report such recommendations to the Congress. Provides that this Act shall not be construed as precluding the use of Federal funds to teach English to Native Americans."
