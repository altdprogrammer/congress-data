    "text": "Export Administration Reform Act of 1990 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to declare that as of September 30, 1991, no permission may be required for the reexport of goods or technology to, or reexport of such items from, a country which maintains export controls on such items cooperatively with the United States pursuant to the agreement of the Coordinating Committee. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to require permission for export or reexport of such items to unreliable end users. Requires the Secretary, if he or she determines a country is noncompliant with such agreement, to require permission to export or reexport such items to such country, and to reexport them from that country. Declares that no permission may be required to reexport U.S. technology from a country when the technology to be reexported is incorporated in other technology, and other specified conditions are met. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to the definition of \"supercomputer,\" to establish and publish in the Federal Register a performance-based indexing system to ensure that such definition and all controls and security safeguard procedures on supercomputer exports and reexports are commensurate with technological advances. Sets forth circumstances under which such safeguards are not required. Directs the Secretary of State to seek the approval of the Coordinating Committee for proposals that: (1) no permission be required to export goods or technology (the export of which to China would require only notification of Coordinating Committee members) to any foreign country; and (2) there shall be a presumption of approval of any license application to export goods and technology at a higher technical level, for civil end uses, to Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary and to other Eastern European countries that were controlled as of January 1, 1990, but that meet specified criteria and enforce certain safeguards against the diversion of such items to other controlled countries or unauthorized consignees, or to unauthorized uses. Requires the Secretary, no later than 30 days after the Coordinating Committee approves such proposal, to publish: (1) those changes in the goods and technology subject to controls, and the changes in those controls, made pursuant to such proposal; and (2) a list of Eastern European countries that meet certain diversion safeguards criteria. Directs the Secretary to implement such proposal by a date established by the Coordinating Committee. Authorizes the approval of export license applications for exports or reexports to the Soviet Union of goods or technology for civil uses only. Declares it to be U.S. policy to: (1) approve general exceptions, on behalf of U.S. exporters, to the Industrial List portion of the International Control List of the Coordinating Committee, and to support identical exceptions for exporters from countries in the Committee; and (2) provide specific guidelines to U.S. exporters with respect to goods, sectors, and end users eligible for such exceptions, and to notify such exporters of all agreements adopted by the Committee with respect to such exceptions. Prohibits the imposition of export controls on the transmission, broadcast, or distribution of any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through a broadcasting station, newspaper, or periodical publication or on equipment used for such transmission, broadcast, or distribution. Directs the President to enter into negotiations with Committee member governments to: (1) allow exports of telecommunications used in civil applications to Eastern Europe without notification to or review by the Committee; and (2) allow certain exports of such items to the Soviet Union. Prohibits items from being included on both the Commodity Control List and the United States Munitions List. Declares that any license for the export of goods or technology shall also authorize the export of operation technical data related to such items, whether or not such data is referenced in such license."
