Title II: Disposal of Excess Federal Lands on Guam - Requires the Administrator of General Services to transfer, without consideration, the United States' right, title, and interest in any real property on Guam (except for lands within the boundaries of the War in the Pacific National Historic Park) which is determined to be excess under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to a commission to be established by the Government of Guam to dispose of such property to promote economic self-sufficiency and private sector development. Declares that such property shall not be subject to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Requires the title to such property to revert to the United States if the commission attempts to convey or otherwise transfer ownership of such property other than to a United States person. Repeals the requirement set forth in the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1981 that the sale by the Government of Guam of certain property, including property within the Apra Harbor complex, conveyed to it by the Secretary of the Navy shall only be for monetary consideration."
