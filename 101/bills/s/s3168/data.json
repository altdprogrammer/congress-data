Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish standards with respect to exposed pipelines and navigation hazards; (2) establish a pipeline and navigational hazards reporting program; (3) establish a mandatory periodic inspection program for offshore pipeline facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets; and (4) require by regulation that pipelines that are exposed or constitute a navigation hazard be buried within six months after the condition is reported to the Secretary. Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act to direct the Secretary to: (1) encourage vessel operators to report potential or existing navigational hazards involving pipelines; (2) establish standards for what constitutes a navigation hazard; and (3) report to the Congress regarding specified aspects of underwater pipeline burial, location, and rights-of-way."
