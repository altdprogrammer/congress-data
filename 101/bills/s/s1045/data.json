Requires such official to identify: (1) any minimum criteria not met; and (2) any pertinent information absent from the statement but available elsewhere. Sets a deadline by which the U.S. Executive Director of such institution is prohibited from voting in favor of an action significantly affecting environmental quality unless an environmental impact assessment meeting certain criteria has been made available for a specified period before the date of the vote. Requires environmental assessment summaries to be made available to Federal agencies and the public. Requires such official to: (1) inform the management of such institutions of the expected nature of such statements; and (2) begin discussions with their personnel to facilitate the conduct of environmental impact assessments. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) make Federal personnel available upon request to assist an institution in making such assessments; (2) take steps with both donor and borrower nations to expand international consensus on environmental needs; and (3) file a detailed status report with specified congressional committees on the institution's implementation of procedures for systematically assessing the environmental impact of its activities. Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to report to certain congressional committees on the efficacy of U.S. efforts to encourage timely environmental impact assessment within international financial institutions."
