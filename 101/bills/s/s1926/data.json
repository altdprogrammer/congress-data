Bases crop payment bases on the 1990 crop acreage base. Permits a producer to mix crop plantings as long as the total plantings do not exceed the farm's normal crop acreage base. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the successor law to the Food Security Act of 1985 should embody principles of agricultural competitiveness, flexibility, and rural development."
