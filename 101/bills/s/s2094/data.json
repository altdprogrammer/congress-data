Authorizes the President to furnish assistance to Eastern European countries (including Yugoslavia) which are making significant progress toward achieving political pluralism, economic reform, respect for human rights, and willingness to build a friendly relationship with the United States. Authorizes appropriations for such assistance, inclusive of amounts authorized to be appropriated under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989. Earmarks a specified amount of funds appropriated for Poland and Hungary under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1990 for democratic activities in other Eastern European countries. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to remove Czechoslovakia and East Germany from the list of countries ineligible for designation as beneficiary developing countries. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to give preferential consideration to investment projects in Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia and to authorize OPIC equity investments to be made in such countries. Expresses the sense of the Congress that there should continue to be a Special Coordination for Assistance to Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia. Authorizes Federal agencies participating in SEED activities to conduct programs in Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia. Permits the President to authorize such agencies to implement management and technical assistance programs in such countries. Amends the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 to redesignate the SEED Information Center System as the Eastern European Business Information Center to be based in Washington, D.C., and the capitals of East European countries and Yugoslavia.
