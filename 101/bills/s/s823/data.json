Requires OPIC to annually certify to the Congress that businesses in Poland with respect to which OPIC has undertaken any such activities do not violate any internationally recognized workers' rights. Prohibits OPIC from undertaking any such activities with respect to any project in Poland: (1) which fosters unfair competition with import-sensitive U.S. industries or leads to significantly adverse impacts on U.S. employment; or (2) until the Secretary of State has certified that the Government of Poland has enacted laws which significantly improve the operating conditions for private enterprises in Poland, including the reform of present laws governing joint ventures and the licensing of new businesses."
