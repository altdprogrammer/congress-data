    "text": "Gore-McCain Missile and Proliferation Control Act - Directs the President to impose certain sanctions against: (1) persons who export, transfer, or otherwise engage in the trade of any Military Technology Control Regime (MTCR) item in violation of U.S. export control laws; or (2) less developed states or entities that are importing or deploying destabilizing MTCR items of mass destruction. Declares such sanctions to include the: (1) denial of an export license; (2) prohibition of all contracting with, or procurement of any products and services from, such violator; (3) prohibition of imports from such violator; and (4) denial of technical assistance to, and the denial of the transfer of technology in, aviation, electronics, missiles, or space systems with respect to less developed state or entity violators. Specifies an exception to such sanctions. Authorizes the President to waive sanctions upon a specified certification to the Congress. Requires the President to submit to specified congressional committees a report detailing the efforts of all foreign countries to acquire long-range missiles and destabilizing offensive aircraft. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to require the Secretary of Commerce to refer all export license applications for the export of missile equipment and technology that is not contained on the U.S. Munitions List to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, for review."
