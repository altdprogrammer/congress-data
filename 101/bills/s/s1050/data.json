    "text": "Federal Rail Safety Enforcement Improvement Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (the Act) to require the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Federal Railroad Administration, to investigate thoroughly each accident or incident involving a collision or derailment of a train if it resulted in or caused the release of hazardous materials, or resulted in a fatality or personal injury requiring at least outpatient care. Requires imposition of a civil penalty for any noncompliance with safety rules that has similar results. Directs the Secretary to issue rules and regulations requiring each railroad to report to the Secretary annually on its operations during the preceding year. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirement if the cost of compliance would outweigh any safety benefits. Increases the minimum penalty for violations of such Act from $250 to $500. Authorizes appropriations for the National Academy of Sciences to study the railroad track designing process."
