Specifies that research at the Center shall be directed primarily toward desert lands managed by BLM, but authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with others to carry out the purposes of this Act. Requires submission to the Congress of an operational plan for the Center, including: (1) a research plan; (2) an assessment of staffing needs for the first five years of operation; (3) proposed cooperative agreements; (4) an assessment of facility needs; and (5) an analysis of operational costs. Directs the Secretary to form a Desert Research Center Advisory Committee to advise the Center and the BLM on desert land research and management. Authorizes appropriations."
