    "text": "Designates specified lands in Los Padres National Forest, California, as the Sespe, Matilija, San Rafael, Garcia, Chumash, and Ventana Wilderness Areas, which shall be components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to take necessary actions for fire prevention and watershed protection in such areas and for the management of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary. Declares that it is not the intent of the Congress: (1) that designation of a wilderness area pursuant to this Act will lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around such area; and (2) that nonwilderness activities or uses outside a wilderness area which can be seen or heard from uses within such area shall not preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness area. Releases certain roadless lands (except for those designated within the wilderness areas pursuant to this Act) for multiple land use. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the Sespe Creek, Big Sur River, and Sisquoc River, California, as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Designates certain creeks and rivers in California as potential additions to the national wild and scenic rivers systems. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to the California-American Water Company all right, title, and interest of the United States to certain national forest system lands in exchange for its conveyance of all right, title, and interest in certain Ventana Wilderness land. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to construct in the area adjacent to the Chumash Wilderness Area interconnecting trails for off road vehicles to connect: (1) Long Canyon and Sulphur Trails; and (2) Lockwood Creek and Dry Canyon Off Road Vehicle Trail. Withdraws all federally owned lands and interests in such lands within and adjacent to the California Coastal Zone (Monterey) from entry or appropriation under Federal mining laws and from the operation of Federal mineral leasing laws. Authorizes appropriations."
