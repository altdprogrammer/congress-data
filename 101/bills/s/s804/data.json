    "text": "North American Wetlands Conservation Act - Establishes a North American Wetlands Conservation Council. Sets forth elements to be considered by the Council in making recommendations to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for wetlands conservation projects. Requires the Council to submit annual descriptions to the Commission of projects recommended for Federal funding. Directs the Commission to approve, reject, or reorder any project recommended by the Council. Makes Federal funding available for approved projects. Requires the Commission to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on such projects. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to carry out approved projects with funding available under this Act and the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act. Requires that lands, waters, or other interests acquired by the Secretary to carry out such projects be included in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Authorizes the Secretary, subject to certain conditions, to grant funds or convey any real property interest acquired with funding provided by this Act to States or public or other entities if such interests should not be included in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Prohibits the Secretary from conveying such interests to States, public agencies, or other entities unless the recipient is committed to managing such interests in accordance with this Act. Subjects such conveyances to conditions that will ensure that the interests will be administered for the long-term conservation and management of the wetland ecosystem and the fish and wildlife dependent on such ecosystem. Directs the Secretary to grant funds to public and other entities for carrying out wetlands conservation projects in Canada and Mexico. Subjects the granting of such funds to the same conditions applicable to the conveyance of property interests. Prohibits the inclusion of property acquired pursuant to the implementation of such projects in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Amends the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in interest-bearing obligations such portion of the wildlife restoration fund not required for the current year's withdrawals. Sets forth authorized investment activities and the required use of interest held on obligations in such fund. Excludes such interest from revenues to be deducted for administrative expenses. Authorizes the sums of certain penalties or fines received for violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to be appropriated to the Department of the Interior for allocations of funds under this Act. Authorizes additional appropriations. Allocates funds made available under this Act and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. Limits the Federal contribution to wetlands conservation projects to 50 percent of the total cost for projects in the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) make progress payments to wetlands conservation projects; and (2) enter into agreements to make payments on initial portions of such projects, subject to the availability of Federal funds. Requires the head of each Federal agency responsible for acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal lands and waters to cooperate with the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore, protect, and enhance the wetland ecosystems and other habitats for migratory birds, fish, and wildlife within such lands and waters. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the implementation of this Act. Requires the Secretary, in 1991 and quinquennially thereafter, to revise the North American Waterfowl Management Plan with appropriate Canadian officials. Provides that the appropriate officials in Mexico shall be invited to participate in any Plan revision. Prohibits funds made available under this Act and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act from being used for fish and wildlife mitigation purposes under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act or the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Amends the Migratory Bird Conservation Act to provide that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (in lieu of the Secretary of Transportation) shall be a member of the Commission. Provides that only personnel and administrative costs directly related to acquisition of real property shall be levied against the Migratory Bird Conservation Account. Requires the Secretary to undertake to establish migratory bird protection agreements with appropriate Western Hemisphere nations. Amends the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to require the Secretary to identify lands and waters in the United States and other Western Hemisphere nations whose protection, management, or acquisition will foster the conservation of migratory nongame birds. Expands the boundaries of the Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge. Removes a limitation on the amount authorized to be appropriated for the acquisition of lands and interests to be included in such refuge. Amends the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 to require the Secretary to produce assessments of: (1) the estimated total number of acres of wetland habitat as of the 1780's in each State; and (2) the estimated total of wetlands acreage in each State and the percentage of loss of wetlands in each State between the 1780's and the 1980's."
