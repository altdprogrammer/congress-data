Specifies that such rule shall: (1) allow additional time for examination by the attorneys at the court's discretion; (2) allow the court to conduct its own examination and impose reasonable limitations with respect to the questions allowed during such voir dire examination; and (3) limit each side, in cases where there are multiple parties, to an additional ten minutes for each additional defendant, provided that the total time required does not exceed one hour per side. Makes decisions made by a court under such rule non-reviewable except for an abuse of discretion. Directs the Judicial Conference to study and report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the results of such demonstration program."
