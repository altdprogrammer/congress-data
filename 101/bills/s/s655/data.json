    "text": "Public Protection From Passive Smoke Act - Title I: Smoke Free Certifications - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that any vessel at any port (currently at any foreign port) departing for any port in a State or possession obtain a bill of health. Directs the Surgeon General to prescribe regulations to require that domestic vessels, as a part of the bill of health, certify that they do not involuntarily expose the public to the byproducts produced by lighted tobacco. Defines \"domestic vessel\" to mean any regularly scheduled interstate public conveyance, including air, rail, or bus service. Subjects to monetary penalties any vessel or individual, including a passenger, who violates these provisions or who violates any prohibition on smoking enacted by any vessel under these provisions. Title II: General Health Information Concerning Smoking - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish: (1) a program to inform the public of dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking; and (2) an Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health. Requires each person who manufactures, packages, or imports cigarettes to annually provide the Secretary with a list of the ingredients added to tobacco that does not identify the company or brand involved. Directs the Secretary to submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report on the additives. Requires information provided to the Secretary to be treated as a trade secret and prohibits its disclosure, except to such committees. Title III: Health Information Concerning Smokeless Tobacco - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to inform the public of dangers to human health resulting from the use of smokeless tobacco products. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and make grants to States to: (1) assist in the development and distribution of programs, materials, and public service announcements respecting the dangers to health from smokeless tobacco; and (2) establish 18 as the minimum age for the purchase of smokeless tobacco. Requires each person who manufactures, packages, or imports smokeless tobacco products to annually provide to the Secretary: (1) a list of ingredients added to the tobacco that does not identify the company or brand involved; and (2) a specification of the quantity of nicotine in each product. Directs the Secretary to submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report on the additives. Requires information provided to the Secretary to be treated as a trade secret and prohibits its disclosure, except to such committees. Repeals specified provisions of the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986. Places provisions similar to those repealed in this Act, except for repealed provisions of such Smokeless Tobacco Act relating to enforcement, regulations, and construction."
