    "text": "Child Care Assistance and Resources Expansion Act of 1989 - Title I: Child Care Grant Program and National Commission - Subtitle A: Child Care Grant Program - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make matching block grants to States for child care related purposes. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Targets child care grants to: (1) child care services to low-income and moderate-income parents, with appropriate fee schedules; (2) resource and referral centers; (3) programs to increase child care slots for infants, handicapped children, and minority children; (4) neighborhood child care centers and after-school child care programs; (5) recruitment and training of senior citizens as child care workers; and (7) development of State licensing and certification requirements. Requires an applicant State: (1) by 1992 to develop and begin implementing licensing or certification requirements applicable to all non-relative family-based and group home child care providers; and (2) by 1994 to require all eligible child care providers to meet such requirements to receive assistance under this Act. Gives priority under State programs to local providers that significantly expand or improve child care services for children of low-income and modest-income parents. Sets the Federal share at 80 percent and the State share at 20 percent of program costs. Sets forth evaluation and reporting requirements. Subtitle B: National Commission on Child Care Standards - Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish within 60 days a National Commission on Child Care Standards which shall: (1) review Federal policies with respect to child care services; and (2) submit to the Secretary proposed model standards for States to follow in regulating child care standards. Requires Governors of States receiving assistance under this Act to report to the Secretary by January 1, 1994, on the extent to which the State has adopted such model standards. Title II: Child Care Food Programs - Amends the National School Lunch Act to reimburse family or group-home child care providers for an additional snack or meal if the child is present for more than eight hours. Title III: Child Care Provider Library Program - Amends the Library Services and Construction Act to direct the Secretary of Education to make competitive grants to State and local public libraries to purchase and deliver children's books, videos, tapes, and toys to licensed or certified family-based or group child care providers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Title IV: Child Development Associate Scholarship Assistance Program - Amends the Child Development Associate Scholarship Assistance Act of 1985 to make eligible for such scholarships any individual with an income equal to or less than 200 percent of the poverty line (currently no greater than the poverty line). Allows States to use assistance under such Act for grants to child care providers to conduct child care training activities. Grants stipends to early childhood professionals who serve as local advisors providing field assistance to individuals receiving scholarships or other assistance under such Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Earmarks a portion of such funds for grants for training services for family-based child care providers and child care center employees. Title V: Child Care Educational Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies to establish or enhance before- or after-school child care programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Expresses the sense of the Congress that a specified authorized amount should be appropriated for FY 1990 to carry out provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for postsecondary institutions to assist disadvantaged students to obtain child care. Title VI: Child Care Tax Incentives - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a child care home business-related tax credit for certified or licensed family or group home child care providers who acquire, rehabilitate, or expand a qualified child care home. Provides for an income-based phase out of the child care tax credit relating to expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. Makes such dependent care services tax credit refundable for low-income families. Establishes an infant care tax credit whereby a parent who stays home with a newborn or newly adopted child until such child reaches 30 months of age would be eligible for a refund, depending on income level. Makes taxpayers who claim the infant care tax credit ineligible for the earned income credit and excludes dependents for whom the infant care tax credit is claimed from qualifying for the dependent care expenses credit."
