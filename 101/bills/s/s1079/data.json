Directs the Secretary to assure that eligible individuals are informed of the availability of the statement. Makes the provision of such statement to each eligible individual who attains age 60 and is not receiving benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Act mandatory from FY 1994 through 1999, if his or her mailing address can be determined. Requires the provision of such statement biennially by FY 2000 to each eligible individual who is not receiving OASDI benefits and for whom a mailing address can be determined. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, by October 1, 1996, on the implementation of this Act's requirements. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize the Internal Revenue Service to disclose the mailing address of an eligible individual to the Social Security Administration."
