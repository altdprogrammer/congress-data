    "text": "Hazardous Materials Rail Transportation Safety Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) issue regulations for emergency response procedures for rail carriers in accident or emergency situations involving the transportation and storage of hazardous materials; (2) require the listing of 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers on hazardous materials shipping papers; and (3) promulgate regulations requiring training courses, certified by the Secretary, to be given by any person engaged in hazardous waste transportation. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to direct the Secretary to make grants to the States for emergency response training. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund for such purpose. Directs the Federal Railroad Administration (the Administration) to increase the number of inspections it conducts on trains, tracks, and major signal systems used in connection with hazardous materials transportation. Mandates that each train carrying hazardous materials be inspected by railroad inspectors at its point of origin. Prescribes an inspection schedule for track and major signal systems associated with hazardous materials shipments. Requires the Secretary to employ and maintain a specified additional number of safety inspectors to implement the inspections required by this Act. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a study of railroad tank car design and to report the results of such study to the Congress. Requires the Administration to hire one professional engineer to specialize in the development of improved tank car specifications, regulations, and inspections. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to impose criminal penalties upon persons who deface or remove hazardous materials transportation placards. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures for making available to State and local officials copies of enforcement actions against regulation violators. Imposes civil penalties for such violations. Directs the Administration to inspect bridges on hazardous materials transportation routes and to assess the current condition of bridges nationwide to determine if bridge safety regulations are needed. Authorizes appropriations."
