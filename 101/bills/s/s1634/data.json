    "text": "Drug-Free Rural America Act - Requires the Director of National Drug Control Policy to designate a Rural Drug Policy Coordinator to examine the special needs of rural areas in drug interdiction and coordinate the drug interdiction efforts of Federal agencies in such areas. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to set aside specified sums for rural areas. Directs the Attorney General to create 72 additional drug enforcement agent positions within the Drug Enforcement Administration to be assigned to drug interdiction activities in special need rural areas (i.e., States with a population density of 50 or fewer persons per square mile which experienced a rise in drug-related crime over the preceding five years). Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to establish a one-year highway drug interdiction program in which a grant of $500,000 shall be made to each of five special need rural areas. Specifies that such monies shall be used to: (1) establish a drug liaison office within the State police force to coordinate drug interdiction activities; (2) develop a plan for the most efficient use of State and local police forces responsible for highway patrol in drug interdiction; (3) provide financial support to implement such plan; and (4) evaluate and report to the Director on the effectiveness of the uses of such grant monies. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a drug interdiction training program for law enforcement officers in rural areas."
