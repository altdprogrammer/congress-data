    "text": "Reclamation Reform and Integrity Act of 1990 - Amends the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to require: (1) the price of irrigation water delivered under a water service contract entered into with the Secretary of the Interior after October 12, 1982, to reflect a substantial share of associated fixed construction costs in addition to operation and maintenance charges; and (2) that the disposal of excess lands after the enactment of the Reclamation Reform Act Amendments of 1990 to nonexcess owners be for fair market value related to the delivery of irrigation water in order to be eligible to receive irrigation water. Repeals the authority for incorporating renewal clauses in Bureau of Reclamation water service contracts. Requires the Secretary to evaluate all unstarted reclamation projects in accordance with the June 1987 Statement of Procedures regarding the use of normalized commodity prices in the evaluation of the costs and benefits of future water projects. Amends the Reclamation Projects Act of 1939 to require farmers who receive irrigation water from Federal reclamation projects and who are using that water to produce surplus crops to pay 50 percent of the full cost for delivery of that water under contracts entered into two years after the enactment of this Act and at least the full cost for delivery of such water under contracts entered into four years after such enactment, except as provided."
