Directs the Center to maintain records of persons evicted from certain public housing and to provide public housing agencies with such information upon request. Requires public housing agencies to provide the Center with tenant eviction information. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish safeguards for the use of such information with respect to housing eligibility; and (2) annually review such data for accuracy and remove information that is no longer useful. Provides penalties for violations of such safeguard provisions. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to make persons evicted from public housing because of criminal activity or crimes of violence ineligible for public housing for ten years."
