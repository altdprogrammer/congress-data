    "text": "SSI Disabled Children's Eligibility Act of 1989 - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and conduct an ongoing outreach program for children who are potentially eligible for SSI disability benefits. Requires the Secretary to annually report to the Congress on the effectiveness of such program. Requires the Secretary to assess a child's physical and mental impairments and the extent which they interfere with age appropriate daily living activities in determining such child's SSI eligibility. Establishes a presumption that a child under age four with a genetic or other diagnosed impairment is disabled or blind for SSI purposes if it is probable that clinical and laboratory techniques administered when the child is older will accurately demonstrate that the medical severity of such impairment is sufficient for SSI eligibility purposes. Requires the Secretary to make every reasonable effort to include the evaluation of a pediatrician or pediatric specialist in the determination of a child's eligibility or continuing eligibility for SSI disability benefits. Directs the Secretary to: (1) consider age-appropriate medical criteria and limitations on activities of daily living developed by childhood disability experts in reviewing and revising the medical criteria for evaluating child impairments; and (2) publish an explanation of deviations from the recommendations of such experts before prescribing final regulations concerning revised medical criteria for evaluating child impairments."
