    "text": "Antiterrorism Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal criminal code to define the term \"international terrorism\" to include activities that: (1) involve violent acts that are a violation of Federal or State laws, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; (2) appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping; and (3) occur primarily outside U.S. territorial jurisdiction or transcend national boundaries. Authorizes any U.S. national injured in his person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism to bring a civil action in U.S. district court and recover treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney's fees. Specifies that a final judgment or decree rendered in favor of the United States in certain classes of criminal proceedings (such as those involving the murder of a foreign official, kidnapping, hostage taking, killing of a U.S. national, or an aircraft piracy-related offense) or in favor of any foreign state in a criminal proceeding to the extent that such judgment or decree may be accorded full faith and credit under U.S. law shall stop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense in a subsequent civil proceeding under this Act. Sets forth provisions with respect to jurisdiction and venue for and limitation of, such civil actions. Amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to make an exception to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign State in any case in which damages are sought for injuries sustained from terrorist acts or any other violation of international law which was perpetrated or aided by such State or any official or employee acting within the scope of his office or employment."
