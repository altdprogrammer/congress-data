Requires the Secretary of Agriculture in order to make a determination of borrower bad faith, to first obtain a written opinion from the Department of Agriculture's Office of General Counsel. Requires borrower good faith with regard to net recovery buyout loan restructuring. Increases from 45 days to 90 days the period for borrower repayment of certain loan obligations. Requires the Secretary to collect data and report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding bad faith borrowers, bad faith net recovery buyouts, and related information."
