Requires that any pension plan surplus at the time of such a termination be: (1) paid to the employees; (2) placed in a new plan with higher benefits; or (3) placed in a trust for the exclusive benefit of the employees. Makes such trust continue to the end of the moratorium. Provides that distribution of plan assets would occur in accordance with applicable law then."
