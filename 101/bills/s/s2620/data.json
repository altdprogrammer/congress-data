    "text": "Judicial Intercircuit Conflict Resolution Demonstration Act - Creates an alternative appellate procedure for resolving conflicting Federal circuit court decisions under which the U.S. Supreme Court is authorized to refer a case involving a conflicting issue to the Clerk of the Supreme Court who is then required to choose another Federal circuit court which has not ruled on such an issue to decide the case. Grants such a court jurisdiction over all issues referred. Allows such a court to issue such orders as may be necessary concerning its jurisdiction. Deems the decision of such a court to be final, subject only to the right of a party adversely affected by the decision to file a motion for review by the Supreme Court. Provides that if such review is not sought or is sought and denied, the opinion of such court shall have precedential effect in each such respective Federal court of appeals circuit ruling on such an issue. Authorizes the Supreme Court to issue rules to govern such procedure. Directs the Judicial Conference of the United States to establish a committee to monitor and evaluate the operation and effects of this Act. Directs such committee to report to the Congress and the Conference on such operations and effects by January 1, 1995. Terminates this Act on December 31, 1996."
