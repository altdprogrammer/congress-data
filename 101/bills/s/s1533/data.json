    "text": "Declares that, notwithstanding provisions prohibiting the transportation of passengers between points in the United States in foreign vessels, passengers may be transported in foreign flag cruise vessels between ports in Alaska and between ports in Alaska and other U.S. ports. Requires the termination of such service one year after a U.S. cruise vessel, meeting other requirements, offers or advertises such service, subject to exception. Requires termination notices to be issued in the reverse of the order in which the foreign vessels entered the coastwise service under these provisions and only in such number as to ensure that the passenger-carrying capacity removed is equal to or minimally greater than the capacity of the U.S. vessel entering service."
