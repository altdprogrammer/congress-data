    "text": "Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act - Makes it unlawful for any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless: (1) the transferor has notified, by registered or certified mail, the chief law enforcement officer for the individual's place of residence about the proposed transfer and either has received a response indicating that such transfer is not prohibited by law or has not received a response indicating otherwise within seven days; (2) the individual has presented to the transferor a statement from the officer indicating that the individual requires a handgun because of a threat to him or his family; or (3) the individual has a State handgun permit that is less than a year old which satisfies the same requirements. Requires any transferor who subsequently receives a report from such officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the individual violates the law to: (1) furnish information about the transfer and the individual to the chief law enforcement officer of the transferor's place of business and the individual's place of residence; and (2) keep confidential any information received which is not otherwise available to the public, with exceptions. Requires a transferor to retain a copy of the individual's sworn statement for at least a year. Requires the law enforcement officer to destroy any copy of the individual's sworn statement and any record containing information derived from such statement within 30 days, unless such officer determines that the transaction would violate Federal, State, or local law. Provides that this Act shall not apply in any State that: (1) requires a seven-day waiting period for the transfer of a handgun to an unlicensed individual; (2) requires a State law enforcement officer to verify an unlicensed individual's eligibility to receive a handgun; or (3) establishes and operates, or participates in, a qualified verification system which meets specified requirements. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act."
