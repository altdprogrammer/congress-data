Directs the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to furnish medical supplies and other humanitarian assistance to Lithuania. Requires the Administrator to solicit donations of medical supplies and medical assistance from the private sector. Authorizes the Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Transportation Command to provide all necessary airlift and sealift to transport such assistance as soon as an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union has been concluded. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits such assistance from being used to pay for, or coerce any person to practice, abortions or involuntary sterilizations. Urges the President to begin negotiations with: (1) the Soviet Union regarding the importation of humanitarian assistance; and (2) the governments of other Soviet republics to enlist their assistance in lifting the blockade."
