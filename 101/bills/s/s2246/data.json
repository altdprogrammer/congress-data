Covers nursing care and home health aide services as home health services if such services are needed less than seven days each week or are needed for up to 38 consecutive days. Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program to create an extension period of hospice care for terminally ill beneficiaries which is to follow the two 90-day periods and the subsequent 30-day period of hospice care coverage currently provided in an individual's lifetime. Covers home intravenous drug therapy services. Increases the Medicare part B premium."
