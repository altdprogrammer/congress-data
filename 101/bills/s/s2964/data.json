    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-08-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require television broadcasting stations to make available without charge an amount of broadcast time to be determined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during appropriate viewing hours to candidates for Federal office within 45 days of a general election. Conditions such free television time upon the candidate: (1) foregoing the purchase or acceptance of any additional amount of television time during the 45-day period; and (2) agreeing to limit the use of free television time to the personal presentation of his or her views in speeches, interviews, debates, or similar formats. Prohibits television licensees from censoring the material broadcast under this Act. Directs the FCC to study the application of this Act to the first general election conducted after its enactment and to report the results of its study to the Congress along with recommendations for extending this Act to primary and other election campaigns."
