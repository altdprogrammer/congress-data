    "text": "Water Resources Development Act of 1990 - Title I: Project Authorizations - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out public works projects in specified locations for improvements to navigation, flood control, storm damage reduction, and the construction of recreation features. Specifies the total cost, as well as the estimated Federal and non-Federal cost, of each project. Title II: Project Related Provisions - Authorizes a project for flood protection for the city of Belen, New Mexico, at a specified cost, estimating the Federal and non-Federal share of such cost. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to deauthorize the current Federal Cross Florida Barge Canal Project. Requires the Secretary of the Army to transfer to Florida all Project related lands and facilities after two years after enactment of this Act, subject to a survey of Project lands determined satisfactory by the Secretary and paid for by Florida. Authorizes and directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Pyramid Lake Indian Tribe and the Secretary of the Interior, to develop a plan for the environmental rehabilitation of the Lower Truckee River. Authorizes the Secretary to develop a plan for facilities to enable the efficient passage of cui-ui and Lahontan cutthroat trout through or around the delta at the mouth of the Lower Truckee River in order to obtain access to their upstream spawning grounds. Requires the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Engineers to make a recommendation to the Congress by June 1, 1991, concerning cost-sharing of the lock replacement at Sault Ste. Marie. Prohibits the Secretary from proceeding with the divestiture of certain locks and dams on the Kentucky River until the Corps of Engineers complies with a certain memorandum of understanding. Directs the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Governor of New York to jointly convene a management conference for the restoration, conservation, and management of Onondaga Lake, New York. Provides for the implementation of the plan adopted by such officials, including the making of grants by the management conference for research, studies, activities, and information-gathering in connection with such plan. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study for the design and construction of a wastewater treatment project in Cranston, Rhode Island. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: General Provisions - Provides that the Federal interest in public works projects of the Corps of Engineers shall be determined only through application of benefit/cost analysis and an environmental impact statement or assessment. Requires any administrative changes to the eligibility criteria for water resource development projects to be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees for oversight review purposes at least one year prior to their implementation. Requires the Secretary to provide the Congress with biennial management reports on the civil works programs in each district and division of the Corps of Engineers. Specifies congressional intent to require sponsors of only certain projects to pay half of preconstruction planning, engineering, and design costs. Establishes the recommended level of protection for a Corps flood control or storm damage prevention project to be at least the 100-year level of protection, if the benefits of providing such level of protection exceed its cost. Reduces the local-area cost-sharing level required for a Federal navigation project to the extent that the benefits of the project accrue to the armed forces. Authorizes the acquisition of real property and associated improvements and monetary compensation to landowners whose property has been eroded on the Missouri River due to reservoir operation by the Corps of Engineers. Establishes a procedure for review by the Secretary of operational changes for Federal water projects of the Corps of Engineers. Directs the Secretary of the Army to develop a pilot program to design and construct a high-speed magnetic levitation system to be integrated with the interstate highway rights-of-way and other appropriate rights-of-way."
