    "text": "National Museum of the American Indian Amendments Act - Amends the National Museum of the American Indian Act to require the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with respect to the inventory of Native American human remains and associated funerary objects to identify their geographic and cultural affiliation. Establishes certain requirements for such inventories and identifications, and the required notifications of affected Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Requires publication of such notices in the Federal Register. Requires the Secretary to provide a written summary (in lieu of an object by object inventory) of Native American unassociated funerary and sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony, based upon all available information. Makes certain information available, upon request, to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to determine the geographic origin, cultural affiliation, and basic facts surrounding acquisition and accession of Native American objects subject to this Act. Sets forth procedures for return of Native American human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. Releases the Federal Government and the Secretary from any claims by an aggrieved party or for claims of breach of fiduciary duty, public trust, or violations of Federal law inconsistent with the provisions of this Act for the repatriation of any item in good faith. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to assist them in reaching and carrying out repatriation-related agreements. Increases from two to ten the number of employees serving the Director of the National Museum of the American Indian of the Smithsonian Institution."
