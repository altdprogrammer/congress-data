Makes such report the management plan for the program and requires its review by the Science Advisory Board and submission to the Congress. Directs the Administrator to appoint a Ground Water Research Manager in the Office of Research and Development to carry out such plan. Directs the Administrator to establish a program of research to develop technologies for the control of groundwater pollution. Requires that such program be carried out utilizing demonstration projects through contracts, cooperative agreements, or grants. Requires the Administrator to evaluate projects on the basis of the potential of the proposed method to effectively control sources of contaminants presenting the greatest risk to human health, the environment, or groundwater and such method's potential application in other locations and circumstances as well as the technical and financial capacities of the project's proposer. Requires the Administrator to supervise and monitor such projects. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of costs.

Requires a biennial review and revision of such list, providing procedures for any person to petition for additions to such list. Requires the Director of the National Toxicology Program to develop and transmit to the Administrator a proposed research program for each listed contaminant which includes studies of chemical and physical properties, health and ecological effects, and its dispersion and persistence when released. Directs the Administrator to publish health assessments for listed contaminants. Provides for the review and revision of such assessments at least every five years. Establishes a schedule for the publication of assessments. Requires the Administrator to conduct nationwide groundwater quality surveys to identify the frequency and concentration of contaminants in groundwater associated with various categories of sources or potential sources of contaminants. Includes monitoring at public and private wells. Establishes a survey schedule for: (1) pesticide applications; (2) septic tanks and cesspools; (3) landfills, surface impoundments, and wastepiles; (4) Class V injection wells; (5) fertilizer applications; (6) irrigation return flows; (7) publicly owned treatment works; (8) light industry; and (9) transportation corridors. Requires the Administrator to complete the following preliminary phases to such surveys: (1) an analysis to determine the types and distribution of sources for each category; (2) the development and preparation of techniques and protocols to be used; and (3) the preparation of health advisories for each contaminant. Requires that groundwater quality surveys provide the Administrator with a clear understanding of the need for instituting contaminant source control strategies on a local, State, or national basis. Requires the Administrator to notify the water system or well owner when a contaminant is found, but requires that information released to the public be of a general nature. Directs the Administrator to notify the appropriate government authorities for response when a source for a contaminant is identified. Requires the Administrator to provide the Congress with a plan for implementing these requirements and a status report on each survey which shall also be submitted to the President, the States, and the public. Directs the Administrator to study and report on the public health effects of nitrates, nitrosamines, and other metabolites of nutrients and nitrogen in drinking water supplies, including sources, levels of exposures, and methods and costs of control. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress by September 1, 1991, on abandoned production and injection wells and the impacts that such wells may have on groundwater quality. Requires peer review of all studies conducted under this Act. Authorizes the provision of facilities and equipment for demonstration projects under this Act, limiting construction of facilities on non-Federal land. Requires the Administrator to make grants to universities or research institutions to establish and operate five groundwater research institutes to conduct research and training and disseminate information on the protection and restoration of groundwater. Bases selection on whether such institute would be located in a region making significant use of groundwater with significant contamination problems and the capacity of such institute to carry on and lead such research. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of costs. Earmarks funds for technology transfer. Requires the Administrator to approve and evaluate each institute's research. Authorizes the Administrator to assist local governments in financing the acquisition and installation of groundwater treatment technologies needed to remove radium from groundwater used as a source of public drinking water.
