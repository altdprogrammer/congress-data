Forbids agents from knowingly selling policies that duplicate a beneficiary's current coverage in any way. Requires States to establish a process for approving or disapproving proposed policy premium increases. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide matching grants to States which meet specified requirements for the establishment of a toll-free telephone hotline and the dissemination of an educational brochure within such States providing individuals with Medicare supplemental insurance information."
