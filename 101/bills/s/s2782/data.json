    "text": "Coastal Zone Improvement Act of 1990 - Title I: Amendments to Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to revise congressional findings and policy provisions. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, during FY 1991 through 1993, to make annual grants to coastal States for the development of coastal zone management programs. Prohibits States from receiving more than two grants. Revises administrative grant provisions to permit the Secretary to make administrative grants to coastal States that match such grants according to specified ratios. Directs the Secretary to establish maximum and minimum grants to promote equity between coastal States and effective coastal management. Revises program approval requirements. Directs State coastal management agencies to submit coastal water quality protection programs to the Secretary. Requires such programs to develop and implement land use management measures for land-based sources of nonpoint source pollution. Outlines program requirements. Directs the Secretary to withhold portions of grants from coastal States that fail to submit an approvable protection program. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to coastal States and local governments for implementing such programs. Directs the Secretary to provide grants to coastal States for such programs. Subjects the provision of such grants to State matching requirements. Permits the Secretary to retain up to 33 percent of grant funds for States that are making exemplary progress in complying with program requirements or that have extreme needs with respect to coastal water quality. Revises provisions concerning interstate grants to authorize the Secretary to make grants to coastal States for program changes that support attainment of coastal zone enhancement objectives. Requires the Secretary to withhold up to 20 percent of amounts appropriated for administrative and coastal resource improvement grants for enhancement grants. Directs the Secretary to conduct a technical assistance and management-oriented research program to support State coastal management program amendments and further international efforts and technical assistance in coastal zone management. Revises provisions concerning performance reviews of State coastal zone management. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend payment of financial assistance for coastal zone management (Current law requires the Secretary to reduce such assistance) if the coastal State is failing to adhere to: (1) a management program or State plan for managing a national estuarine reserve; or (2) the terms of any grant or cooperative agreement. Requires such suspension to last between six and 36 months. Directs the Secretary to withdraw approval of a management program of, and any financial assistance to, a coastal State under specified conditions. Repeals a provision concerning research and technical assistance for improving coastal zone management. Redesignates the National Estuarine Reserve Research System as the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Raises the limit on the amount of financial assistance that may be provided for specified activities in such reserves. Permits assistance for educational or interpretive activities in such reserves to cover 100 percent of all costs for activities that benefit the entire System. Extends the authorization of appropriations under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. Establishes within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration an Office of Ocean and Coastal Zone Management to succeed the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. Title II: International Cooperation in Coastal Zone Management - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Secretary and the Secretary of State should cooperate to develop a program of technical assistance to developing nations for coastal zone management; and (2) coastal zone management should be a component of negotiations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Encourages the Secretaries to initiate discussions with other nations to include coastal zone management as part of an international convention on global climate change."
