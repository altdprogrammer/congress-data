Sets a maximum 14 percent tax rate with respect to such gain. Sets a 17 percent alternative tax rate with respect to corresponding capital gains of corporations. Title II: Indexing of Basis of Capital Assets - Requires indexing of the adjusted basis of capital assets, based on the gross national product deflator, in any year when the annual inflation rate exceeds four percent."
