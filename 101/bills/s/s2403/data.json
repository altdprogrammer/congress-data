    "text": "Montana Interim Roadless Lands Release and Conservation Act of 1990 - Designates certain lands in Montana as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Incorporates the Great Bear Wilderness and the Scapegoat Wilderness into the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Montana shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Montana which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Montana reviewed in the RARE II program and lands of less than 5,000 acres (regardless of whether they have been reviewed) from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to preserve the natural roadless qualities of certain Montana lands. Designates certain Montana lands as special management areas of the National Forest System. Designates parts of the Helena and Deerlodge National Forests as the Elkhorns National Recreation and Wildlife Area. Withdraws the Badger Two-Medicine Area from disposal under the mining and public lands laws and from disposition under the geothermal and mineral leasing laws. Requires the Forest Service to draw up a joint land management plan with the Blackfeet Tribe for such Area. Provides for Blackfeet timber rights and for oil and gas leases on Federal lands within such Area. Directs the Secretary to exchange certain lands in the Porcupine and Gallatin Areas with the Plum Creek Timber, L.P. Company. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire mineral interests owned by Burlington Resources, Inc., that underlay Federal lands within the Clearwater-Monture and Gallatin Areas. Declares that: (1) the Congress has sufficiently reviewed the suitability of the Bitter Creek Wilderness Study Area and the Axolotl Lakes Wilderness Study Area for wilderness designation and finds them adequately studied for wilderness designation; and (2) such lands shall no longer be subject to a certain requirement pertaining to the management of wilderness areas. Authorizes appropriations for the development of a wilderness education and ranger training complex at the Ninemile Ranger Station, Lolo National Forest, Montana."
