    "text": "Establishes an Office of the Inspector General within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Requires the President to appoint an Inspector General who shall report to and be under the supervision of only the Director of Central Intelligence. Allows the Director to prohibit the Inspector General from conducting any audit, inspection, or investigation, or from issuing any subpoena, only concerning ongoing operations and only if such action is necessary to protect vital national security interests. Requires the Director to submit a classified statement to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence justifying such action within seven days. Permits the Inspector General to be removed from office only by the President and requires that the President immediately notify the intelligence committees in writing of the reasons for any such removal. Includes among the duties of the Inspector General: (1) to conduct inspections, investigations, and audits to assure that CIA operations are conducted efficiently and in accordance with applicable law and regulations; and (2) to keep the Director informed concerning violations, abuses, deficiencies, and corrective actions. Requires the Inspector General, in the event he is unable to resolve any differences with the Director on the execution of his duties and powers, to report such matter to the intelligence committees within seven days. Directs the Inspector General to submit a classified semiannual report on his activities to the Director, who shall transmit such report to the intelligence committees."
