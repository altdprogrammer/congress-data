    "text": "Crime Control Act of 1989 - Title I: Gang Violence - Declares that drug trafficking and related gang violence require coordinated and immediate Federal action. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the creation of a new Anti-Gang Unit. Directs the head of such Unit to work with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate the resources necessary to fight gangs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 to the Office of Justice Programs of the DOJ for anti-drug abuse grants to be allocated to State and local task forces which have programs to alleviate gang activity and drug trafficking. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) to establish direct liaison with State and local law enforcement agencies having responsibility for gang investigations and efforts to combat gang-related firearms violations. Provides for the forfeiture of certain assets by individuals convicted of specified narcotics-related offenses to the Secretary of the Treasury and for the recovery of any such assets transferred to third parties. Establishes a rebuttable presumption at trial that any property of a person convicted of a felony is subject to forfeiture if specified conditions are met. Specifies conditions under which the court may enter a restraining order or injunction or take other action to preserve the availability of such assets. Sets forth procedures with respect to: (1) the seizure and disposition of property subject to forfeiture under this Act; and (2) the protection of third party interests in such property. Urges the President to direct the Attorney General to establish a National Commission on Gang Intervention. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) acquire data on the incidence of criminal acts that involve gang violence for calendar years 1990 through 1995; and (2) publish an annual summary of such data. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1995. Prohibits the transportation of a minor to assist in avoiding detection or apprehension with respect to drug-related activity. Subjects an individual who possesses (under current law, uses or carries) a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime to specified terms of imprisonment. Sets penalties for the distribution of firearms to a minor. Encourages the States to separate in State and juvenile correctional institutions inmates who are identified as members of gangs to ease the violence in prisons between rival gang factions. Authorizes appropriations to the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBP) to provide technical assistance to States to facilitate the separation of gang members in State prisons. Title II: Prison Construction and Reform - Authorizes appropriations to the FBP: (1) for FY 1990 for prison construction and repair of existing facilities; (2) for NIC grants to States for educational programs for criminal offenders in State correctional institutions; (3) for FY 1990 for Federal Prison Industries to expand existing educational, vocational, literacy, employment, and industrial training for inmates in Federal correctional institutions; and (4) for FY 1990 for a drug rehabilitation program to be developed by the Director of the FBP. Requires the Director to determine whether facilities located on military bases recommended for closure may be used as Federal confinement facilities. Authorizes such use of any facility accepted for closure by the Congress. Authorizes the transfer to the Attorney General for prison construction of certain unobligated foreign assistance funds allocated to countries which, as shall be certified by the Secretary of State to the Congress, have failed to make adequate progress in reducing illicit narcotics production. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to allow the use of Customs Forfeiture Fund amounts for prison construction on an emergency basis. Title III: Career Criminals - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 to the BATF for the Repeat Offender Program and anti-gang activities to hire additional special agent and support personnel. Requires: (1) the National Institute of Justice to conduct a study and to report on the profile and number of career criminals in America; and (2) the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics to compile and maintain statistics for the number of arrests, prosecutions, and convictions nationwide and to publish and make available to the public annual reports. Title IV: Narcotics Investigative and Task Force - Authorizes the payment of any expenses necessary for the implementation and execution of certain narcotics investigative and task force projects from the DOJ Assets Forfeiture Fund."
