Requires, instead, that the evidence necessary to justify such special wage orders must establish that the industry, or a predominant portion of it, cannot pay the regular minimum wage due to certain economic and competitive conditions. Directs the Secretary of Labor, within 90 days, to promulgate regulations that interpret a specified professional exemption from overtime provisions under the Act to include computer systems analysts, software engineers, and other similarly skilled professional workers, even if such employees are compensated on an hourly basis, as long as they are compensated at an hourly rate at least six one-half times greater than the minimum."
