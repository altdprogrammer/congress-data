Delays the repeal of provisions of such Act affecting part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program until January 1, 1991. Repeals mandatory Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) coverage of the Medicare premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance payments for which individuals whose income does not exceed the Federal poverty level would otherwise be accountable. Directs the Senate Committee on Finance to develop and report legislation, within six months after this Act's enactment, providing older and disabled persons with access to health care which is consistent with their dignity and wishes."
