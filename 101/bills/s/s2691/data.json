Permits such fees to be imposed: (1) on waste generated outside the boundaries of a State; and (2) against landfill operators, solid waste treatment facilities, or persons shipping or transporting solid waste for treatment or disposal. Allows States to delegate such authority to political subdivisions. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to require persons transporting or shipping solid waste in excess of 100 pounds in interstate commerce to submit annual registration statements."
