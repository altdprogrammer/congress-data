Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the establishment and operation of a National Clearinghouse on Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Care. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into cooperative agreements and contracts with respect to emergency medical services and trauma care systems to: (1) conduct and support research, training, evaluations, and demonstration projects; (2) provide technical assistance to State and local agencies; and (3) establish guidelines for the development of uniform State data reporting systems. Directs the Secretary to make an allotment for each State for each fiscal year, mandating that at least 35 percent, subject to adjustment, be used for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the operation of county, regional, or State trauma care systems. Sets forth requirements for such systems. Requires States to use at least 35 percent of the amount available to them for a fiscal year to reimburse designated trauma centers for uncompensated trauma care expenditures. Requires non-Federal matching contributions (in cash or in kind) in a specified ratio for fiscal years after FY 1991. Requires each State, for each fiscal year beginning with FY 1991, to submit the trauma care component of the State emergency medical services plan (State plan) to the Secretary. Sets forth requirements for the State plan. Requires that hospital emergency departments, within their capability, if an individual appears and requests examination and treatment: (1) examine for the existence of an emergency medical condition or active labor and, if such a condition or labor exists, treat the individual until stable, subject to exception; and (2) transfer such individual to other facilities only according to stated criteria. Requires States to adopt standards, and the Secretary to develop a model plan, for the designation of trauma centers, and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies. Mandates that States: (1) require each trauma center to provide certain information to the State central data reporting system annually; (2) submit, to the Secretary at least annually, the information it receives from its data reporting and analysis system; and (3) identify and submit to the Secretary a list of rural areas lacking certain emergency medical services. Sets forth restrictions on the use of State allotments. Requires an annual report from each State to the Secretary. Sets forth a formula for determination of the amount of allotments. Provides for: (1) repayment and offset for failure to use funds as agreed; (2) criminal penalties for certain false statements; (3) technical assistance and provision of supplies and services by the Secretary in lieu of grant funds; and (4) a report by the Secretary to the Congress.
