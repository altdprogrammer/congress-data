Provides that such standards shall require a commercial television broadcast licensee to limit the duration of advertising in children's television programming to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. Authorizes the FCC, after January 1, 1993, to: (1) review and evaluate such advertising limits; and (2) modify such limitations in accordance with public interest after notice and opportunity for public comment. Provides that, after such standards are in place, the FCC shall, in its review of any application for renewal of a television broadcast license, consider compliance with such standards as well as the licensee's programming in connection with the educational and informational needs of children. Requires the FCC to complete a certain proceeding relating to television programming and commercialization policies. Title II: Endowment for Children's Educational Television - National Endowment for Children's Educational Television Act of 1990 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to establish, under the direction of the Secretary of Education, a National Endowment for Children's Educational Television for creating and producing television programming specifically directed toward the development in children of fundamental intellectual skills.

Requires the Secretary to consult with the Advisory Council on Children's Educational Television in making such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to persons using other forms of media and to apply conditions to such grants pertaining to the availability of such programming to commercial television licensees and cable system operators. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such conditions in certain circumstances. Directs the Secretary to establish the criteria for making such grants. Outlines grant application requirements. Limits amounts authorized for such grants. Directs the Secretary to establish an Advisory Council on Children's Educational Television.
