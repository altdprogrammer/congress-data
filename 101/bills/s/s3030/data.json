    "text": "Disaster Assistance Act of 1990 - Title I: Annual Crops - Extends disaster crop loss assistance through the 1990 crop year for wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, soybeans, and other nonprogram crops. Extends crop quality reduction disaster assistance through the 1990 crop year. Reduces disaster assistance payments in relation to Federal crop insurance payments. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to announce within a specified time the conditions for establishing a 1990 farm yield for forage-use crops. Limits to $100,000 assistance received under this Act or in combination with emergency livestock assistance under the Agriculture Act of 1949. Authorizes the substitution of crop insurance program yields for assigned farm yields for 1990 disaster assistance eligibility purposes. Title II: Orchards - Extends disaster assistance (up to $25,000 or an equivalent value in seedlings) to commercial orchardists who suffered 1990 weather-caused tree losses in excess of 45 percent. Title III: Forest Crops - Extends disaster assistance (up to $25,000 or an equivalent value in seedlings) to commercial tree farmers who suffered 1990 weather-caused losses in excess of 45 percent. Title IV: Additional Assistance - Prohibits the Secretary from reducing rental payments to an owner or operator who hays or grazes livestock during the 1989 crop year on land subject to a conservation reserve program contract to the extent that such owner or operator carries out and pays for specified additional conservation practices. Title V: Administrative Provisions - Requires assistance applications to be made by April 30, 1991, or such later date as the Secretary may prescribe. Title VI: Crop Insurance - Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to exclude a 1990 crop's yield from the calculation of Federal crop insurance yields if such crop is eligible for assistance under this Act."
