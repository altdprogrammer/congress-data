Authorizes the court to order that such testimony be taken by closed-circuit TV if it finds that the child is unable to testify in open court because of: (1) the child's persistent refusal to testify despite the courts requests to do so; (2) the child's total inability to testify because of fear, failure of memory, or similar circumstances; (3) the substantial likelihood that the child will suffer emotional trauma; and (4) the child suffering a mental or other infirmity. Requires: (1) the court to support any ruling on the child's inability to testify in open court with findings on the record; and (2) expert testimony to support such a finding, with respect to the child's persistent refusal to testify. Specifies that: (1) if the court orders the taking of testimony by television, the attorney for the Government and the defense attorney shall be present in the room with the child and the child shall be subject to direct cross-examination; and (2) the only other persons allowed to be present are the child's attorney or guardian ad litem, those persons necessary to operate the closed-circuit equipment, and other persons whose presence is determined by the court to be necessary to the welfare and well-being of the child.

Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to videotaped depositions of child victims and child witnesses. Sets forth requirements with respect to competency examinations for child witnesses. Sets forth provisions with respect to confidentiality of information involving a child in connection with a criminal proceeding. Authorizes the court: (1) on motion by any person, to issue an order protecting a child's name or other information concerning the child in the course of the proceedings if the court determines that disclosure would be detrimental to the child; and (2) to allow disclosure to anyone to whom disclosure is necessary for the welfare and well-being of the child. Grants the child victim or witness the same right to submit victim impact statements prior to sentencing as prescribed for an adult. Directs that child victims or witnesses be assisted by their court-appointed guardian ad litem in preparing victim impact statements. Encourages the use of multidisciplinary teams designed to assist child victims or child witnesses. Delineates the role of such teams. Authorizes the court to appoint a guardian ad litem where a child was a victim of, or a witness to, a crime involving abuse or exploitation to protect the best interests of the child. Sets forth guidelines with respect to criteria in choosing, and the duties of, such guardian. Grants a child testifying at or attending a judicial proceeding the right to be accompanied by an adult attendant to provide emotional support to the child, subject to certain restrictions. Authorizes the court, in any proceeding where a child is called to give testimony, to designate the case as being of special public importance and to expedite the action. Requires the court to ensure a speedy trial and, in deciding whether or not to grant a continuance, to take into account the child's age and the potential adverse impact the delay may have on the child's well being. Declares that there is no statute of limitations for any sex offense involving a child victim. Provides for extension of the period of limitations with respect to civil actions arising out of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim. Amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to set forth analogous provisions with respect to the rights of child victims and child witnesses in civil cases. Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to create a hearsay exception for an out-of-court statement made by a child of less than 13 years concerning acts or conduct related to alleged completed or attempted crimes of sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exploitation of such child or concerning a crime against another witnessed by the child that is not otherwise admissible if: (1) the child testifies at the proceeding, or testifies by means of videotaped deposition or closed-circuit TV and, at the time of such testimony, is subject to cross-examination about the out-of-court statement; (2) the court finds that the child's out-of-court statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness; or (3) the court finds that the child is unable to testify effectively for various reasons, such as the child's death, absence, refusal, or substantial likelihood that the child would suffer emotional trauma. Requires the proponents of the statement to inform the adverse party of the intention to offer statement and its content sufficiently in advance of the proceeding to provide the defendant with a fair opportunity to prepare a response. Delineates factors which the court may consider in determining whether a statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, including the child's knowledge of the event, the age and maturity of the child, any apparent motive the child may have to falsify or distort the event, and whether extrinsic evidence exists to show the defendant's opportunity to commit the act complained of in the child's statement. Requires the court to support with findings on the record any rulings pertaining to the child's inability to testify in open court and the trustworthiness of the out-of-court statement. Authorizes the court to permit the child to use anatomical dolls, puppets, drawings, or any other demonstrative device to assist in testifying. Requires a person who, while engaged on Federal land or in a federally operated or contracted facility in one of specified professional capacities or activities including health care provider, social worker, teacher, child care worker, law enforcement officer, foster parent, and commercial film processor or in a federally operated or constructed facility, learns of facts that give reason to suspect an incident of child abuse, to report the suspected abuse as soon as possible to a designated agency. Makes the failure to report a misdemeanor. Provides for civil liability for failure to report such an incident. Abrogates the privileged nature of communications between a health care provider and a patient or between a husband or wife in any investigations or judicial actions resulting from a report of abuse or neglect. Requires that such professionals receive periodic training in the obligations to report, as well as in the identification of abused and neglected children. Chapter 6: Child Care Worker Employee Background Checks - Requires Federal agencies involved with the provision of services to children under age 18 to assure that all existing and newly-hired employees undergo a criminal history background check. Sets forth procedures with respect to the conduct of such background checks. Specifies that: (1) any conviction for a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, or drug offense shall be grounds for denying employment or for dismissal of an employee engaged in specified child care services; (2) an incident in which an individual has been charged, but where the charge has not yet been disposed of, shall permit the employee's suspension from any contact with children until the case is resolved; and (3) convictions of other crimes may be considered if they bear on an individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children. Sets forth requirements with respect to questions to be asked in employment applications, criminal history records checks, and access to (and the right to challenge the accuracy of) the criminal history report. Encourages voluntary criminal history checks for others who may have contact with children. Subtitle M: Steroid Trafficking Act of 1990 - Steroid Trafficking Act of 1990 - Chapter 1: Anabolic Steroids - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to add anabolic steroids to Schedule II. Excludes from Schedule II anabolic steroids those expressly intended for administration through implants to cattle or nonhuman species and approved for such administration, with exceptions. Authorizes the refill without restriction of any prescription for anabolic steroids subject to refill on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. Requires the Attorney General to exempt any compound, mixture, or preparation containing an anabolic steroid from application of all or part of such Act if, because of its concentration, preparation, mixture, or delivery system, it has no significant potential for abuse. Authorizes the Attorney General to exempt an anabolic steroid from any production regulations if it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an accepted treatment for a rare disease or condition under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and it does not have a significant potential for abuse. Chapter 2: Human Growth Hormone - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to increase the criminal fine and imprisonment and penalties for knowing distribution of, or possession with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than treatment of a recognized disease or other medical condition (currently, a recognized disease) pursuant to the order of a physician. Increases the penalties if the offense involves (currently, if the distribution or intended distribution is to) an individual under the age of 18 years. Declares a violation a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act for purposes of forfeiture. Authorizes the Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate such offenses. Repeals provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 relating to forfeiture and illegal trafficking in steroids or a human growth hormone. Title II: Treatment - Subtitle A: Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Block Grant - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize appropriations for the Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services Block Grant Program. Revises the grant allotment formula. Permits Federal funds allotted to the States for alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health treatment to be used to pay for inpatient hospital drug treatment services pursuant to a contractual arrangement with a hospital if: (1) needed residential treatment services could not otherwise be provided; and (2) the rates paid for such services do not exceed 125 percent of the cost of rates typically required for comparable residential services. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or reduce certain matching requirements where the State requests a waiver and the Secretary determines that failure to grant such request would result in a reduction in the resources that would otherwise be used to provide direct treatment services and that such resources are essential to implementation of the State drug abuse plan. Authorizes the use of State allotments to provide counseling to family members of drug abusers and to develop, implement, and operate programs of treatment for adult and juvenile substance abusers in State and local criminal and juvenile justice systems. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive provisions requiring a State to use a specified percent of grant funds for intravenous drug abuse treatment programs where a State has submitted an application for such a waiver prior to September 30, 1991. Subtitle B: Programs Targeting Females - Revises requirements and other matters relating to an existing program regarding drug and alcohol abuse model projects for pregnant and postpartum women and their infants. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle C: Treatment Improvement - Chapter 1: General Treatment Provisions - Establishes in the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) the Office for Treatment Improvement (Treatment Office) to: (1) collaborate with the Director of the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention and the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); (2) evaluate State plans and carry out programs under existing provisions; (3) train providers of prehospital emergency medical services; (4) conduct or support described programs; and (5) take other actions with regard to treatment. Authorizes appropriations.
