    "text": "Immigration Reform Act of 1989 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a two-tiered immigration annual entry level made up of \"family connection\" immigrants and \"independent\" (employment-related) immigrants. (Includes up to 30,000 annual backlog immigrants for FY 1991 through 1993). Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor to report annually to the President and to the appropriate congressional committees on the social, economic, and environmental impacts of immigration. Requires: (1) such report, beginning in FY 1994 and at subsequent three-year intervals, to consider the need to change immigration levels; and (2) the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to hold appropriate hearings. Limits annual \"family connection\" and \"independent\" visas from each foreign country. Revises the immigration admissions preference system to allocate \"family connection\" preferences as follows: (1) unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (eight percent of worldwide level); (2) spouses and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent resident aliens (68 percent of worldwide level); (3) married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (12 percent of worldwide level); and (4) never married brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens and former fifth preference immigrants (12 percent of worldwide level). Allocates \"independent\" preferences as follows: (1) special immigrants (three percent of worldwide level); (2) aliens who are members of the professions with advanced degrees or aliens of exceptional ability (40 percent of worldwide level); (3) skilled workers (34 percent of worldwide level); (4) employment creation (three percent of worldwide level, or 3,900 visas, whichever is greater, to any alien with a minimum $1,000,000 capital investment that will create at least ten jobs); and (5) selected immigrants chosen on a point system basis. Sets forth the following system criteria: (1) age; (2) education; (3) English language ability; (4) U.S. occupational demand; and (5) occupational training and work experience. Amends the petitioning procedure provisions of such Act to permit special immigrant petitions to be filed with the Attorney General. Amends labor certification provisions of such Act to exclude certain classes of immigrants unless the Secretary of Labor certifies that there are not sufficient qualified U.S. workers and that employment of aliens in such positions will not adversely affect U.S. workers' wages and conditions. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study, and hold public hearings, about the labor certification process and to report to the appropriate congressional committees. Establishes a two-year conditional permanent resident status for certain alien entrepreneurs and their families. Provides for selected immigrant visa fees to be charged for the filing of a petition for certain immigrant categories. Amends Federal law to credit a Department of State fund (derived from fees collected by consular officers) to pay the expenses of research and development of visa and passport functions. Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to prepare a study and report quarterly to the Congress regarding Cuban immigration into the United States."
