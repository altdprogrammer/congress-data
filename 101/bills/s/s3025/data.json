Authorizes the provision of a variable housing allowance for members of the reserves called to active duty for a period of less than 140 days under specific conditions other than during a war or national emergency. Removes the limitation on the payment allowed for unused accrued leave in the case of members, reserve members, or retired members called to active duty under specific conditions other than during a war or national emergency. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income payments received for active military service during any part of which such member: (1) served in a dangerous foreign area; or (2) was hospitalized as a result of wounds, a disease, or an injury incurred while serving in a dangerous foreign area. States that such exclusion shall not apply to compensation exceeding $2,000 received by a commissioned officer in any month."
