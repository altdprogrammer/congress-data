    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-10-27", 
    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to define \"indecent communication\" as any communication in which any discussion or reference is made to the genitals, breasts, or buttocks, actual or simulated sexual intercourse or contact, bestiality, masturbation, or sado-masochistic sexual abuse which is patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards. Requires common carriers to make available, to the extent technically feasible, a separate, easily distinguishable telephone prefix number for providers who offer access to specified indecent or obscene communications and require every provider to designate which prefix corresponds to the type of messages it proposes to provide. Specifies that any provider who offers access to such a communication through any telephone number other than one within the prefix assigned is in violation of such Act."
