    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use competitive bidding in establishing Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) payment rates for laboratory services. Requires the Secretary to establish a laboratory services competitive bidding advisory committee to examine and report to the Congress on the feasibility and use of competitive bidding for Medicare laboratory services. Directs the Secretary to establish demonstration projects to assess various alternative methods of setting payment rates, including competitive bidding, for durable medical equipment. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the findings of such projects and implement the payment rate method which is most cost effective without diminishing access to or the quality of care. Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program to require Medicare fiscal intermediaries to utilize shared claims processing hardware and software systems if to do so would enhance Medicare operational efficiency and effectiveness. Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program to impose the same requirement on Medicare carriers. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with two fiscal intermediaries and two carriers without regard to the regular nominating process for the purpose of replacing two of the least effective Medicare fiscal intermediaries and two of the least effective Medicare carriers."
