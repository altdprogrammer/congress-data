    "text": "Excellence in Education Act of 1989 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for education excellence and vital skills incentives. Limits the amount and duration of any such grant to an LEA for an elementary school or for a secondary school. Directs the Secretary to select, on the basis of specified criteria, one elementary school and one secondary school of excellence for each congressional district and make one education excellence incentive grant to the LEA having authority over such school. Makes the selection criteria improvements in academic performance and attendance. Gives academic performance twice as much weight as attendance. Directs the Secretary to establish a list of recognized national standardized tests for academic performance determinations. Directs the Secretary to select, on the basis of specified criteria, one secondary school of excellence in vital skills (i.e. mathematics and general science) in each congressional district and make one incentive grant to the LEA with authority over that school. Makes the selection criteria improvement in academic performance in mathematics and science skills and improvement in attendance. Gives academic performance twice as much weight as attendance. Directs the Secretary to establish a list of recognized national standardized tests with emphasis on mathematics and general science skills. Requires establishment of merit selection boards to devise procedures, including specified criteria, for the selection of the principal and teachers who shall be paid merit bonuses. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1992, with two-thirds of such funds to be used for education excellence incentive grants and one-third for vital skills incentive grants."
