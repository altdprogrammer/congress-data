    "text": "Kids Helping Kids Act of 1989 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a Secondary School Student Community Service Program. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies for programs involving juniors and seniors in secondary schools in public and community service. Gives priority to programs which integrate students and their regular classroom curriculum with the academic or social development of other youth. Requires that programs be designed to assist children at risk of failing in school and in the future workforce, including programs such as: (1) tutoring of academically disadvantaged students; (2) initiatives coordinated with other community service programs; and (3) public and community service to individuals most in need, such as the homeless, the educationally disadvantaged, children involved with drugs or alcohol, pregnant teenagers, young parents, or school dropouts. Requires that program funds be used to supplement and not supplant other funds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994."
