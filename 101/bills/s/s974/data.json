    "text": "Nevada Wilderness Protection Act of 1989 - Designates the following lands in Nevada as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Alta Toquima Wilderness and the Arc Dome Wilderness in the Toiyabe National Forest; (2) the Boundary Peak Wilderness in the Inyo National Forest; (3) the Currant Mountain Wilderness and the East Humboldts Wilderness in the Humboldt National Forest; (4) certain lands in the Humboldt National Forest which shall be incorporated in, and deemed a part of, the Jarbidge Wilderness; (5) the Mount Rose Wilderness in the Toiyabe National Forest; (6) the Quinn Canyon Wilderness and the Ruby Mountains Wilderness in the Humboldt National Forest; (7) the Mount Charleston Wilderness and the Table Mountain Wilderness in the Toiyabe National Forest; and (8) the Grant Range Wilderness, the Mount Moriah Wilderness, and the Santa Rosa-Paradise Peak Wilderness in the Humboldt National Forest. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nevada shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nevada which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above apply to national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas, subject to mandatory review by the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires the Secretary to report periodically to the Congress on livestock grazing in these wilderness areas. Reserves to the United States a quantity of water sufficient to fulfill the purposes of the wilderness areas created by this Act. Declares that nothing in this Act relating to reserved Federal water rights shall be construed as establishing precedent with regard to future designations. Does not preempt State jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in the national forests. Permits the installation in wilderness areas of hydrologic, meteorologic, or climatological collection devices. Declares that nothing shall preclude low level overflights of military aircraft, the designation of new units of special airspace, or the use or establishment of flight training routes over the Alta Toquima, Arc Dome, Currant Mountain, or Table Mountain Wilderness Areas."
