    "text": "Foreign Language Competence for the Future Act of 1989 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make: (1) grants to higher education institutions and consortia for summer foreign language institutes for elementary and secondary school foreign language teachers; (2) payments to States under the Higher Education Act of 1965 for Teacher Incentive Grants to undergraduates majoring in a foreign language or graduate students in education who intend to teach a foreign language; (3) matching grants to States and major metropolitan areas for foreign language foundations and world trade council units to provide language training, translation services, and information about other cultures and markets to small- and medium-sized businesses seeking to enter export markets; (4) demonstration grants to State education agencies, higher education institutions, and nonprofit education and professional associations for technology for distance learning; and (5) demonstration grants to eligible consortia for critical languages and area studies programs and other activities to improve and expand elementary and secondary foreign language instruction. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1995. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to add requirements for Teacher Incentive Grants for undergraduate majors in foreign languages and graduate education students who intend to teach a foreign language. Requires such grant recipients to teach for a specified period in public elementary or secondary schools in areas of the State experiencing the greatest shortage of foreign language teachers. Prohibits a State from awarding such teacher incentive grants unless the appropriation for State Student Incentive Grant Programs exceeds a specified amount."
