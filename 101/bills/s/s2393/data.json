    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-06-13", 
    "text": "Safe Food Transportation Act of 1990 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations (including standards) with respect to the transportation of food, food additives, drugs, devices, and cosmetics in motor vehicles and rail vehicles which are used to transport either municipal waste or nonfood products which, when so transported, would make the food, food additives, drugs, devices, or cosmetics unsafe to the health of humans or animals. Prohibits a person from using, offering or arranging for the use of a motor vehicle or rail vehicle to provide transportation of food, food additives, drugs, devices, or cosmetics if the vehicle is used to transport certain municipal waste or certain nonfood products. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt from such prohibition vehicles that meet specified standards that safeguard the health of humans and animals. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a list of articles of municipal waste or nonfood products whose common transportation does not make such food, food additives, drugs, devices, or cosmetics unsafe to human or animal health. Prohibits a person from using, offering for use, or arranging for the use of a motor or rail vehicle to provide transportation of asbestos or products which present an extreme danger to human or animal health, despite decontamination procedures, unless such vehicles are used only to provide transportation of such asbestos and dangerous products, and municipal waste. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any prohibition of this Act if such waiver is not contrary to the public interest. Authorizes the Secretary to provide inspections conducted by State employees to carry out the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. Requires the Secretary to develop an inspector training program. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties. Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue a final rule regarding Federal motor carrier safety regulations to: (1) establish a public information system that periodically updates the safety ratings of motor carriers which have received unsatisfactory safety ratings; (2) provide a rating reassessment within nine months after receipt of a motor carrier's written request to have an unsatisfactory rating reassessed; and (3) prohibit the operation of certain commercial motor vehicles by motor carriers who have received unsatisfactory safety ratings. Requires the Secretary to submit operational guidelines to the Congress with specific criteria for determining civil penalties for motor carrier safety violations that pose imminent safety hazards. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to impose mandatory minimum criminal penalties for the unlawful distribution or possession of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a truck stop or safety rest area. Precludes the suspension of criminal sentences and denies probation for repeat offenders. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish specified sentencing guidelines for violations of this Act. Amends the Truck and Bus Safety and Regulatory Reform Act of 1988 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to initiate a rulemaking proceeding regarding improved braking performance standards for commercial motor vehicles. Classifies Department of Transportation safety inspectors at GS-12 of the General Schedule. Sets a deadline by which the Secretary must establish procedures ensuring the timely correction of commercial motor carrier safety violations found in a nationwide random reinspection system. Directs the Secretary to establish operational procedures requiring highway safety personnel to initiate enforcement actions whenever certain motor carrier safety violations can be documented. Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding for enhanced truck visibility."
