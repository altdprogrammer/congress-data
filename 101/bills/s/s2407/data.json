    "text": "Organ Procurement Process Review Act of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that an organ procurement organization (OPO), in order to be eligible to receive certain grants, have a service area of sufficient size which will include not less than 50 potential organ donors each year. (Current law requires a service area of sufficient size such that the organization can reasonably expect to procure organs from not less than 50 donors each year.) Repeals provisions of the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 which delay the effective date of certain related amendments, with regard to an OPO designated under specified provisions of the Social Security Act, until two years after the initial designations of the organization. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the National Advisory Committee for Review of the Organ Procurement Process."
