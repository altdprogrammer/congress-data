  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-10-27", 
    "text": "Crime Control Act of 1990 - Title I: International Money Laundering - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress periodically with respect to certain reporting requirements involving currency transactions, the manner in which U.S. agencies collect and use such reports to support investigations and prosecutions, and a summary of: (1) sanctions imposed for failure to comply with reporting requirements; (2) criminal indictments which resulted from investigations initiated by analysis of such reports; and (3) information regarding suspicious financial transactions provided voluntarily by financial institutions. Directs the Secretary to appoint an Electronic Scanning Task Force to: (1) study methods of printing on U.S. currency notes in denominations of $10 or more a serial number that may be read by electronic scanning; (2) make an assessment of the cost of implementing such scanning; and (3) make recommendations about the amount of time needed for implementation. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) authorize the Attorney General or the Secretary to transfer forfeited personal property (or the proceeds of the sale) to any foreign country which participated in the seizure or forfeiture of the property, if certain conditions are met; (2) include within the definition of \"specified unlawful activity\" with respect to money laundering, offenses under provisions relating to false statements by an employee of a financial institution and false statements in connection with loan and credit applications and to exclude offenses relating to bank fraud; and (3) modify the knowledge requirement with respect to international money laundering. Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to allow Government investigators access to financial institution records without customer notification in connection with a criminal money laundering investigation. Revises the Federal money laundering statute to include laundering proceeds of activities unlawful under laws of a foreign nation. Title II: Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 - Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 - Subtitle A: Improving Investigation and Prosecution of Child Abuse Cases - Requires the Director of the Office of Victims of Crime to make grants to develop multidisciplinary child abuse investigation and prosecution programs. Enumerates program criteria, including requirements identifying an appropriate site for counseling child victims of sexual and serious physical abuse and neglect, referring cases to such counseling center within 24 hours, minimizing the number of interviews the child victim must attend, requiring that all interviews and meetings with a child victim occur at the counseling center, designating a director for the multidisciplinary program, and assigning volunteers or staff advocates to each child's family. Requires the Director to make grants to provide technical assistance and training to attorneys and others instrumental to the criminal prosecution of child abuse cases in State or Federal courts. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle B: Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program - Requires the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to: (1) make grants to expand the court-appointed special advocate program; and (2) establish criteria to be used in evaluating grant applications, which shall include a program providing screening, training, and supervision of court-appointed special advocates. Authorizes appropriations, subject to specified limitations. Subtitle C: Child Abuse Training Programs for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners - Requires the Administrator to provide technical assistance and training to judicial personnel and attorneys to improve the judicial system's handling of child abuse and neglect cases and provide administrative reform in juvenile and family courts. Directs the Administrator to make grants to: (1) national organizations to develop model technical programs to improve the judicial system's handling of such cases; and (2) State courts or judicial administrators for programs that provide for training or technical assistance to judicial personnel and attorneys in juvenile and family courts, and for administrative reform in such courts. Directs that the grant criteria give priority to programs which improve procedures for preventing placement of children in foster care, make reasonable efforts to reunite the family, and coordinate information and services. Authorizes appropriations, subject to specified limitations. Requires that at least 80 percent of such funds be used for juvenile and family court and State judicial programs. Subtitle D: Federal Victims' Protections and Rights - Amends the Federal criminal code to allow in a proceeding involving an alleged offense against a child or involving a child witness, the attorney for the Government, the child's attorney, or the guardian ad litem to apply (at least five days before trial date) for a court order that the child's testimony be taken in a room outside the courtroom and be televised by two-way closed-circuit television (TV). Authorizes the court to order that such testimony be taken by closed-circuit TV if it finds that the child is unable to testify in open court because: (1) of the child's fear; (2) there is substantial likelihood that the child will suffer emotional trauma, supported by expert testimony; (3) the child suffers a mental or other infirmity; or (4) conduct by the defendant or defense counsel causes the child to be unable to continue testifying. Requires the court to support on the record any findings on the child's inability to testify in open court. Permits the court, in determining whether the impact on an individual child of one or more of such factors is so substantial as to justify such an order, to question the minor in chambers or at some other comfortable place other than the courtroom, on the record for a reasonable period of time with the child's attendant, the prosecutor, the child's attorney, the guardian ad litem, and the defense counsel present. Specifies that: (1) if the court orders the taking of testimony by television, the attorney for the Government and the defense attorney shall be present in the room with the child and the child shall be subject to direct cross-examination; and (2) the only other persons allowed to be present are the child's attorney or guardian ad litem, those persons necessary to operate the closed-circuit equipment, and other persons whose presence is determined by the court to be necessary to the welfare and well-being of the child. Requires that: (1) the child's testimony be transmitted by closed-circuit TV into the courtroom for the defendant, jury, judge, and public view; (2) the defendant be provided with the means of private, contemporaneous communication with his attorney during the testimony; and (3) the closed-circuit TV transmission relay the defendant's image into the room in which the child is testifying. Sets forth requirements with respect to competency examinations for child witnesses. Sets forth provisions with respect to confidentiality of information involving a child in connection with a criminal proceeding. Authorizes the court: (1) on motion by any person, to issue an order protecting a child's name or other information concerning the child in the course of the proceedings if the court determines that disclosure would be detrimental to the child; and (2) to allow disclosure to anyone to whom disclosure is necessary for the welfare and well-being of the child. Grants the child victim or witness the same right to submit victim impact statements prior to sentencing as prescribed for an adult. Directs that child victims or witnesses be assisted by their court appointed guardian ad litem in preparing victim impact statements. Encourages the use of multidisciplinary teams designed to assist child victims or child witnesses. Delineates the role of such teams. Authorizes the court to appoint a guardian ad litem or a witness to a crime involving abuse or exploitation to protect the best interests of the child. Sets forth guidelines with respect to criteria in choosing, and the duties of, such guardian. Grants a child testifying in or attending a judicial proceeding the right to be accompanied by an adult attendant to provide emotional support to the child, subject to certain restrictions. Directs that the image of the child attendant, for the time the child is testifying or being deposed, be recorded on videotape. Authorizes the court, in any proceeding where a child is called to give testimony, to designate the case as being of special public importance and to expedite the action. Requires the court to ensure a speedy trial and, in deciding whether or not to grant a continuance, to take into account the child's age and the potential adverse impact the delay may have on the child's well-being. Declares that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under age 18 shall preclude such prosecution before the child reaches age 25. Provides for extension of the period of limitations with respect to civil actions arising out of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim. Authorizes the court to permit the child to use anatomical dolls, puppets, drawings, or any other demonstrative device to assist in testifying. Sets penalties for knowing or intentional violation of the privacy of child victims and child witnesses. Requires a person who, while engaged on Federal land or in a federally operated or contracted facility in one of specified professional capacities or activities (including health care provider, social worker, teacher, child care worker, law enforcement officer, foster parent, and commercial film processor) learns of facts that give reason to suspect an incident of child abuse, to report the suspected abuse as soon as possible to a designated agency. Makes the failure to report a misdemeanor. Provides immunity for good faith reporting and associated actions. Requires that such professionals receive periodic training in the obligations to report, as well as in the identification of abused and neglected children. Subtitle E: Child Care Worker Employee Background Checks - Requires Federal agencies involved with the provision of services to children under age 18 to assure that all existing and newly-hired employees undergo a criminal history background check. Sets forth procedures with respect to the conduct of such background checks. Specifies that: (1) any conviction for a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, or a drug offense shall be grounds for denying employment or for dismissal of an employee engaged in specified child care services; (2) an incident in which an individual has been charged, but where the charge has not yet been disposed of, shall permit the employee's suspension from any contact with children until the case is resolved; and (3) convictions of other crimes may be considered if they bear on an individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children. Sets forth requirements with respect to questions to be asked in employment applications, criminal history records checks, and access to (and the right to challenge the accuracy of) the criminal history report. Encourages voluntary criminal history checks for others who may have contact with children. Subtitle F: Grants for Televised Testimony - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to States for equipment, personnel training, and videotaping for closed-circuit televising of the testimony of children who are victims of abuse. Sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) grant applications; (2) review of applications; (3) allocation and distribution of funds; and (4) reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle G: Treatment for Juvenile Offenders Who Are Victims of Child Abuse or Neglect - Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to public and nonprofit private organizations to develop, establish, and support projects which: (1) provide treatment to juvenile offenders who are victims of child abuse or neglect and to their families; (2) provide transitional services (including individual, group, and family counseling) to such offenders to strengthen family relationships and encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems related to the abuse or neglect, to facilitate their alternative placement, or to prepare juveniles aged 16 and older to live independently; and (3) carry out research and evaluation of treatment and transitional services provided with grants made under this Act. Sets forth priorities for awarding grants. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 - Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 - Subtitle A: Restoration of Recordkeeping Requirement - Amends the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 to prohibit: (1) knowingly selling or otherwise transferring, or offering for sale or transfer, any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, or other matter produced with materials which have been mailed or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce or intended for such shipment which contains one or more visual depictions of actual sexually explicit conduct and which does not have affixed to it a statement of the location of records with respect to the performance depicted on every copy of such matter; or (2) any person to whom such Act applies from failing to create or maintain records required by, or from knowingly failing to comply with provisions of, such Act or from knowingly making a false entry or failing to make an appropriate entry in such records. Deletes provisions providing that proof that a person fails to comply with recordkeeping requirements raises a rebuttable presumption that a performer (i.e., a person depicted engaging in, or assisting another to engage in, sexually explicit conduct) was a minor. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of such act. Removes \"lascivious exhibitions of genitals or public areas\" from the definition of \"sexually explicit conduct\" for purposes of sexual exploitation provisions. Subtitle B: Sexual Abuse Penalties - Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend existing guidelines for sentences involving sexual crimes against children so that more substantial penalties may be imposed if the Commission determines current penalties are inadequate. Increases the maximum penalty for sexual abuse of a minor from five to 15 years' imprisonment. Establishes penalties for knowingly possessing with intent to sell visual depictions of sexually explicit conduct involving minors, or possession of three or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, videotapes, or other matter containing such depictions. (Excludes depictions by words alone.) Eliminates limits on the amount of fines for such possession and for other specified activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors. Title IV: Offenses Involving Children - Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend existing sentencing guidelines for the kidnapping, abduction, or unlawful restraint of a victim where the offender is age 18 or over and is not a specified relative or individual having legal custody of the victim to take into consideration whether the victim was: (1) intentionally maltreated to a life-threatening degree (i.e., denied food or medical care); (2) sexually exploited; or (3) placed in the care or custody of, and subjected to such treatment or exploitation by, another person who does not have a legal right to such care or custody for money or other consideration. Title V: Protection of Crime Victims - Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 - Requires all Federal law enforcement agencies to make their best efforts to accord victims of crime with the right to: (1) be treated with fairness and respect for the victim's dignity and privacy; (2) be protected against their accused offenders; (3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) attend public court proceedings related to the offense under certain conditions; (5) confer with the Government attorney assigned to the case; (6) receive restitution; and (7) receive information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. Directs Federal law enforcement agency heads to designate the persons required by this Act to identify and provide certain services to the victims of a crime such as informing victims about where to receive medical care, counseling, and police protection and about developments during the investigation and prosecution of the crime and after the trial (such as the arrest of a suspected offender or an escape of a convicted offender). Directs the Attorney General or the head of another department or agency that conducts an investigation of a sexual assault to pay, either directly or by reimbursement, the cost of a physical examination of the victim which an investigating officer determines was necessary or useful for evidentiary purposes. Directs that a responsible official provide the victim with general information regarding the corrections process, including information about work release, furlough, and probation. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to extend the deadline for operation of a State victim compensation program under the Victims of Crime Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the States should make every effort to adopt specified goals of a Victims of Crime Bill of Rights, including the right of crime victims to be treated with respect and dignity, to be reasonably protected from the accused, to have a statutorily designated advisory role in decisions involving prosecutorial discretion (such as plea bargaining), to be present at all proceedings, with exceptions, and to be compensated for the damage resulting from the crime. Title VI: Law Enforcement Agencies - Subtitle A: Maintaining Funding for State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies - Amends the Omnibus Act and the Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 1990 to maintain funding for State and local law enforcement agencies for FY 1991. Amends the Omnibus Act to include expansion of prosecutorial, defender, and judicial resources within authorized actions under the Bureau of Justice Assistance's drug control and system improvement grant program. Subtitle B: National Crime Information Center Project 2000 - National Law Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995 to implement the NCIC 2000 project, a project developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at upgrading the technological capabilities of the National Crime Information Center in order to meet the needs of U.S. law enforcement agencies into the next century. Requires a congressional report by the Director of the FBI concerning project implementation and fund uses. Title VII: Federal Law Enforcement and Judicial Assistance - Authorizes appropriations for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. courts, U.S. attorneys, defender services, U.S. marshals, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) U.S. Border Patrol. Title VIII: Rural Drug Enforcement - Amends the Omnibus Act to set aside specified sums for rural drug enforcement assistance. Sets forth additional requirements, including requiring within each assistance application a statement specifying how grants will be coordinated with other grants received under such Act for the same fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations. Title IX: Mandatory Detention - Mandatory Detention for Offenders Convicted of Serious Crimes Act - Amends the Bail Reform Act to require the detention, pending sentence or appeal, of any person found guilty of a crime of violence, an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death, or a drug offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed, unless there is a substantial likelihood of acquittal or a new trial or the Government is not recommending imprisonment and the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the community. Makes exceptions to mandatory detention upon appeal of the Government in exceptional cases.
