    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-06-14", 
    "text": "Financial Crimes Prosecution and Recovery Act of 1990 - Title I: National Commission on Financial Crimes - Establishes the National Commission on Financial Crimes to investigate fraud and abuse in the financial services industry and to recommend procedures for improving interagency cooperation and tactics for law enforcement officers in the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes. Sets forth provisions with respect to the membership, powers, pay, reporting requirements, and termination of the Commission. Title II: Improvements in Administration of the Department of Justice - Directs the Attorney General to establish a financial crimes strike force in each Federal judicial district which is in the top quartile of such districts with respect to the total number of criminal referrals filed with the Attorney General by the appropriate Federal banking agencies relating to residents of, or persons located in, such district. Provides for local control of each such strike force, through the U.S. Attorney for such district, except as otherwise provided by the Attorney General. Sets forth provisions regarding pay for attorneys on financial crimes strike forces. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish a merit system to recognize and reward outstanding efforts of individuals engaged in the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; (2) prohibit any U.S. attorney or any other attorney employed by the Department of Justice from taking into account the dollar amount of any loss incurred in connection with any financial crime in making a determination with respect to the investigation or prosecution of such crime; and (3) prescribe by regulation that the investigation of any referral from an appropriate Federal banking agency related to a financial crime involving an insured depository institution in default or in danger of default, or of any troubled institution, be given priority in case management. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to make specified civil money penalties collected under such Act available to the Attorney General to carry out any provision of law. Amends the Federal criminal code to grant specified officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation administrative subpoena authority regarding specified financial crimes. Sets forth provisions: (1) with respect to standards governing production of items subpoenaed; and (2) granting persons complying in good faith with a summons or order issued under this Act and producing the materials sought immunity from civil liability to the consumer for such production or nondisclosure of such production. Title III: Improvements in the Administration of the FDIC and the RTC - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to grant subpoena authority to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as a conservator or receiver or for carrying out authority with respect to an insured depository institution. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to grant the FDIC and the RTC access to Internal Revenue Service returns and return information upon written requests by the respective Board of Directors and upon certification by the Board that it has a substantial need for such returns or return information. Amends the FDIA to authorize Federal banking agencies, in conducting any investigation, examination, or enforcement action under such Act, to: (1) request the assistance of any foreign banking authority; (2) maintain an office outside the United States for such purposes; (3) provide assistance to a foreign banking authority, upon request, if the requesting authority is conducting an investigation involving a violation of laws or regulations relating to banking matters that the requesting authority administers or enforces; and (4) conduct such an investigation as is necessary to collect information and evidence pertinent to such a request without regard to whether the facts stated in the request also constitute a violation of U.S. law. Authorizes the FDIC and the RTC, as conservator or receiver of any insured depository institution, to request the assistance of any foreign banking authority and provide assistance to any such authority in accordance with this Act. Requires the FDIC and the RTC to each maintain a permanent office to coordinate foreign investigations or investigations on behalf of foreign banking authorities. Authorizes the Board of Directors of the FDIC to act in its own name and through its own attorneys in any action or proceeding in which the FDIC is an interested party, whether in its corporate capacity or as conservator or receiver for any insured depository institution. Grants priority to the FDIC over certain claims or actions filed or begun against an affiliated party of the insured depository institution by depositors, creditors, or shareholders of the institution after enactment of this Act. Authorizes the FDIC, as conservator or receiver for any insured depository institution, to avoid any transfer of interest of an institution-affiliated party or any transfer of interest or obligation of person determined to be a debtor of the institution that was made within five years of appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver, if such party made such transfer or incurred such liability with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the insured depository institution. Specifies circumstances under which the FDIC may recover the property transferred or the value of such property. Sets forth provisions regarding prejudgment attachments of assets where an institution-affiliated party may be required to provide restitution to the institution or where the party is a debtor of the institution, and where the assets will be dissipated or otherwise placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court or FDIC before any recovery may be completed unless a trustee is appointed. Establishes criminal penalties for knowingly concealing assets or property from the FDIC or the RTC as a conservator or receiver for any insured depository institution. Requires each Federal banking agency to require directors of depository institutions to complete an educational course on their duties as directors every three years. Authorizes a court or the Attorney General to direct disclosures of matters occurring before a grand jury during an investigation of a banking law violation to identified personnel of a financial institution regulatory agency upon a finding of substantial need, subject to specified conditions. Excludes the payment of restitution under specified Acts, including the FDIA from discharge under bankruptcy provisions. Amends the Federal criminal code to subject to civil forfeiture property which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to mail fraud, or fraud by wire, radio, or television, affecting a financial institution. Amends the FDIA, the Federal Credit Union Act, the Revised Statutes, the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Holding Company Acts of 1956 and 1970, and the Home Owners' Loan Act to permit the appropriate Federal banking agency, the FDIC, or, in the case of the latter statute, the Director, to apply to specified courts to recover from a depository institution administrative costs arising out of actions taken to recover a civil penalty. Title IV: Taxpayer Recovery Act - Taxpayer Recovery Act of 1990 - Makes an exception to a discharge in bankruptcy for: (1) restitution that the debtor has been ordered to pay by a State or Federal court in any criminal proceeding arising from an act that caused a loss to any bank, savings association, or credit union (bank); or (2) damages provided in any judgment, order, or consent decree entered in any State or Federal court, or in any settlement agreement entered into by the debtor, arising from any act involving fraud or reckless disregard for the law committed with respect to any such institution. Requires that any individual acting as a director, officer, or institution-affiliated party of a bank be considered to be acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to such institution for purposes of a provision making an exception to a discharge from bankruptcy involving fraud or defalcation while acting in such capacity. Specifies that reliance by a creditor will not be required to establish an exception to discharge if the creditor is a financial regulatory agency that is a successor to a bank. Sets forth time limits for the filing of a complaint objecting to the discharge of a debt owed to: (1) a bank that is closed, is in receivership or conservatorship, or is sold to another bank in a transaction assisted by a financial regulatory agency; or (2) such an agency. Specifies that an individual debtor who has committed an act involving fraud or reckless disregard for the law or is subsequently adjudicated to have committed such an act during the pendency of his bankruptcy proceeding with respect to any bank that is in receivership or conservatorship or that is sold to another bank assisted by a financial regulatory agency shall not be exempt from: (1) more than $7,500 in value of the debtor's aggregate interest in any real property that the debtor uses as a residence: and (2) the debtor's interest in any insurance policy or annuity."
