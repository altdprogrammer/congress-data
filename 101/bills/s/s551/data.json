    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the method of calculating the deduction for capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers, allowing a deduction equal to: (1) 60 percent (100 percent for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of less than $25,000) for assets held five years or longer; (2) 30 percent for assets held for between three and five years; and (3) ten percent for assets held for between one and three years. Excludes collectibles from capital assets for purposes of this deduction. Reduces the alternative tax rate on capital gains realized by a corporation from 34 percent to: (1) 14 percent for assets held five years or longer; (2) 24 percent for assets held for between three and five years; and (3) 31 percent for assets held for between one and three years. Adds 50 percent of the noncorporate taxpayer capital gains deduction as a tax preference item for purposes of the minimum tax."
