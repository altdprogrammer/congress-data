    "text": "National Security Reform Act - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to prohibit the approval, conduct, or funding of covert operations (other than those intended solely for obtaining necessary intelligence) by or on behalf of the executive branch, until the President makes a finding that each such covert operation is important to national security. Requires that each finding be immediately reduced to writing and signed by the President, except that the President may make such finding orally in an emergency affecting vital U.S. interests. Requires the oral finding to be reduced to writing within 24 hours. Provides that a finding shall be effective only with respect to operations beginning after the finding was made. Requires the President to contemporaneously, but in no event later than 24 hours after the making of a written finding, inform the intelligence committees of any such finding. Allows the President to limit such notification, under extraordinary circumstances affecting vital U.S. interests, to oral notice to the chairman and ranking minority members of the intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. Makes the knowing deception of the Congress, or of any committee or subcommittee, a crime punishable by imprisonment for one to five years and a fine of up to $10,000. Allows an individual to avoid liability by notifying in writing the committee or subcommittee of any violation and providing the truthful information in its place within five days."
