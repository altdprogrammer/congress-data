    "text": "American Trade, Growth, and Employment Promotion Act - Directs the President to begin negotiations with Mexico and the Caribbean Basin countries to establish a North American free trade area. Requires any agreement reached through such negotiations to be reciprocal and to provide mutual reductions in trade barriers. Authorizes the President to enter into bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with foreign countries to establish expanded trade areas. Requires any such agreement to ensure a mutual and reciprocal reduction of tariff and nontariff trade barriers. Authorizes the President to enter into trade agreements with any developing country for the purpose of establishing expanded trade areas and ultimately promoting a reciprocal reduction in trade barriers. Requires such agreements to provide for a gradual (within five years) reduction or elimination of tariff and nontariff trade barriers by the developing country. Authorizes the President to enter into such an agreement only if the President determines that such gradual reduction or elimination: (1) is justified as a transition period in view of the developing country's per capita income, economic development, and international competitive position; and (2) will promote the eventual mutual elimination of such trade barriers. Requires the President to terminate or suspend such agreement if the President determines that the developing country has failed to carry out its obligations under the agreement. Authorizes the President to exclude any article from any agreements negotiated under this title if such exclusion is necessary to achieve an agreement for a free trade area or an expanded trade area. Sets forth the requirements for implementation of trade agreements entered into under this title. Sets forth a congressional veto procedure with respect to the implementation of proposed trade agreements."
