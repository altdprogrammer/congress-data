Increases civil penalties for child labor violations. Raises the amount of the fine for such violations. Makes willful violators who are repeat offenders ineligible: (1) for any direct or indirect Federal grant or Federal guaranteed loan, for five years after determination; and (2) to pay a special training wage below the minimum wage rate. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to post in affected school districts the name of each employer who violates child labor provisions or regulations, together with the location and nature of the violation. Requires certification of school attendance for purposes of child labor certification. Directs the Secretary to find and declare as particularly hazardous for employment of children between the ages of 16 and 18 the following occupations (among others): (1) poultry processing; (2) paper bailing; (3) fish and seafood processing; (4) school bus driving; and (5) handling power-driven meat slicing machines in restaurants."
