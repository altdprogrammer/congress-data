    "text": "Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to set forth provisions concerning the \"Foreign Relations of the United States\" historical series, a documentary record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and diplomatic activity. Requires all Federal agencies engaged in foreign policy to develop procedures for their historical offices to coordinate with the Department of State's Office of the Historian in selecting materials for inclusion in the series. Directs the Advisory Committee on the Foreign Relations of the United States Historical Series for the Department of State to review and make recommendations concerning the documents to be included. Requires selected documents to be submitted for declassification review. Directs Federal agencies, if a document is not declassifiable because of a need to protect sources, methods, or sensitive national security information, to make deletions in the text to make the document declassifiable. Requires Federal agencies, if the meaning of a document is so altered by such deletions that it would be misleading, to prepare an unclassified summary of the document. Sets forth congressional reporting requirements for agencies that refuse to prepare declassified documents or unclassified summaries. Establishes the Advisory Committee on the Foreign Relations of the United States Historical Series for the Department of State. Authorizes the Advisory Committee to approve the withholding of a document or a portion of a document from publication in the historical series if necessary to: (1) avoid publication of matters which would impede current diplomatic negotiations or official activities of the U.S. Government; or (2) condense the record and avoid repetition of details. Directs the Secretary of State to ensure that the historical series shall be published within 30 years after the events documented. Requires all Department of State documents to be automatically declassified 30 years after the events documented and made available to the public at the National Archives unless such documents would: (1) compromise weapons technology important to the U.S. national defense or provide access by other nations to weapons design information or to cryptologic systems or codes; (2) disclose the names of living persons who provided confidential information to the United States where disclosure would result in harm to such persons; or (3) impede current diplomatic negotiations or official activities of the U.S. Government. Directs the Advisory Committee to review and report annually to the Information Security Oversight Office, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the State Department's declassification procedures and documents representative of State Department documents that remain classified after 30 years."
