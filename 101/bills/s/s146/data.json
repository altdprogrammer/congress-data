    "text": "Day Care for Working Families Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a demonstration matching grant program in the interest of increasing the availability of affordable high quality day care services, especially to low-income families. Limits the Federal share of such grants to 50 percent. Authorizes grant awards to employer-community day care councils comprising representatives of private employers, child care programs, parents, local government, and other community institutions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988. Amends the Social Security Act to increase the authorization for certain block grants to be allotted to the States for social services for FY 1988 and thereafter. Reserves a specified amount of such allotments for child care services. Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make loans, up to a $30,000,000 fiscal year maximum, to assist child care providers in constructing and renovating space to be used for child care. Directs the SBA to: (1) give priority to projects in areas with the greatest need and to organizations serving significant numbers of children of low-income families; (2) establish an outreach program to advise and assist prospective day care providers; and (3) report to the Congress on its program with respect to day care providers. Precludes any State from receiving certain funds unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that the State has established specified minimum requirements for day care centers. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study and to report to the Congress, within one year, concerning: (1) the availability of day care services for school age children in each State; and (2) the need for such services."
