    "text": "Savings Bank Safety and Soundness Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to: (1) modify the definition of \"bank\" to exclude a savings bank that is a Savings Association Insurance Fund member; (2) include in the definition of \"State bank\" any savings bank that is a Bank Insurance Fund member; and (3) include in the definition of \"appropriate Federal banking agency\" the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision in the case of any savings association that is a Savings Association Insurance Fund member (thus preventing State-chartered savings associations from classifying themselves as savings banks in order to evade Federal restrictions upon depository institution practices). Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to make technical changes in conformance with this Act."
