    "text": "Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 - Title I: Purpose - Specifies the purposes of this Act, including regulatory reform, the establishment of an independent insurance agency to provide deposit insurance, and the provision of improved supervision and enhanced enforcement powers. Title II: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Authorities and Responsibilities - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits held at savings associations as well as commercial banks. Increases the membership of the FDIC's Board of Directors from three to five members. Specifies that the additional two members shall be the Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and a citizen appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Revises certain definitions for the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Specifies that the term \"insured deposit\" shall include any liability which constituted an \"insured account\" within the meaning of the National Housing Act prior to the enactment of this Act, provided certain conditions are met. Specifies that the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBS) shall be considered the appropriate Federal banking agency in the case of a savings association or a savings and loan holding company. Includes within the definition of \"savings association\" any institution that was supervised by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) prior to the enactment of this Act, a Federal savings and loan association or Federal savings bank, or a building and loan, savings and loan, homestead association, or a cooperative bank organized and operated under State law, or a corporation that the FDIC considers to be operating substantially in the same manner as a savings and loan association. Provides that every FSLIC insured savings association shall continue to be insured by the FDIC without application or approval. Provides that whenever a financial institution files an application or notice for membership with, or to commence or resume business with, the appropriate Federal banking agency, such agency must provide such application to the FDIC for comment. Requires such agency to take the FDIC's comment into account in deciding whether to grant the application. Provides that certain State financial institutions shall continue as insured institutions. Allows any Federal savings association authorized to do business by the FHLBS to become an insured financial institution upon the filing of an application with the FDIC together with a certificate issued by the FHLBS, unless insurance is denied by the FDIC. Sets forth procedures for the FDIC to evaluate such an application. Specifies the factors to be considered in granting or denying insurance coverage. Requires the FDIC to notify the FHLBS if such insurance coverage is denied, and to give specific reasons in writing for such denial. Requires every noninsured financial institution which becomes insured by the FDIC to pay any entrance fee prescribed by FDIC regulations. Requires that such fee be credited to either the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) or the Savings Associations Insurance Fund (SAIF) depending on which fund the institution joins. Prohibits any insured financial institution from participating in any type of conversion transaction which would result in a change of membership from one such fund to the other without the approval of the FDIC. Places a five-year moratorium on the approval of such conversion transactions, except in limited circumstances. Requires financial institutions which participate in such conversion transactions to pay specified entrance and exit fees. Provides that whenever the FDIC incurs a loss in connection with the default of an insured financial institution, or in connection with providing assistance to an insured financial institution in danger of default, any other commonly-controlled insured financial institution shall be liable to the FDIC and on request shall reimburse the FDIC for any such loss. Specifies the method of calculating such liability. Sets forth procedures for imposing and collecting such liability. Limits the rights of any third parties in such proceedings. Provides that for a five-year period no BIF members shall be held liable for the default of a SAIF member and no SAIF members shall be held liable for the default of a BIF member. Defines \"commonly-controlled\" for purposes of determining such liability. Adds as a factor to be considered by the FDIC in evaluating applications for insurance coverage the risk presented to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the BIF, and the SAIF. Allows the FDIC, after reaching agreement with the other Federal banking agencies, to require insured financial institutions to file additional reports for insurance purposes. Requires the FDIC to set the assessment rate for insured financial institutions annually. Specifies that the annual assessment rate for BIF members shall be determined independently from the annual assessment rate for SAIF members. Prescribes the assessment rates for BIF members for 1989, 1990, and 1991 onward. Prescribes the assessment rates for SAIF members through 1990, for 1991 through 1993, and for 1994 onward. Allows the FDIC to raise or lower such assessment rates under specified circumstances. Limits any increase in the assessment rate to 50 percent over the annual assessment rate of the prior year. Specifies that such assessments shall be paid semiannually. Allows assessment credits to BIF members and SAIF members for years in which the ratio of the net worth of such funds to the value of insured deposits reaches a certain level. Specifies that such a credit shall be applied to the assessment becoming due for the next semiannual assessment period. Extends the provisions of the Change in Bank Control Act to savings associations as well as banks. Includes as an additional corporate power of the FDIC the authority to define any terms used in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that are not specifically defined and to interpret the definitions of any terms that are not defined. Grants the FDIC the same authority to examine insured savings associations and to insure the deposits held at savings associations as it presently has with respect to insured banks. Establishes two insurance funds (the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Associations Insurance Fund (SAIF)) to be used by the FDIC to carry out the insurance purposes of this Act. Specifies that such funds are both to be operated and administered by the FDIC. Requires such funds to be separately maintained and not commingled. Specifies that the BIF shall consist of the assets of the Permanent Insurance Fund and all amounts assessed of BIF members. Specifies that the SAIF shall consist of all amounts assessed of SAIF members (which are not required for the Financing Corporation or the Resolution Funding Corporation pursuant to this Act) and of funds provided by the Secretary of the Treasury according to a specific schedule for FY 1991 through FY 1999. Authorizes the Secretary to provide additional amounts for such fund if the minimum net worth of the fund falls below a certain level. Authorizes appropriations for such funds. Authorizes the FDIC to borrow funds for the use of the SAIF. Provides that such borrowings shall be a direct liability of the SAIF and shall be subject to certain limitations. Revises and defines the authorities and duties of the FDIC as the receiver or conservator for insured Federal financial institutions and for insured State financial institutions. Specifies that all insurance payments made on account of a closed bank or insured branch of a foreign bank shall be made only from the Bank Insurance Fund and all payments made on account of a closed savings association shall be made only from the Savings Association Insurance Fund. Provides that when the FDIC pays insurance to a depositor, the FDIC shall be subrogated to the depositor's claim against the financial institution. (Such right of subrogation now applies only to national banks.) Revises and defines the authorities and duties of the FDIC in the establishment of bridge banks in cases of failed or failing financial institutions. Authorizes the FDIC to use such bridge banks in the case of failed or failing financial institutions as well as banks. Increases from one to three the number of times a bridge bank may be granted a one-year extension of its corporate existence. Revises procedures for the termination and dissolution of bridge banks. Sets forth the method and procedures for the valuation and determination of claims by third persons against financial institutions in default. Establishes the FSLIC Resolution Fund (Fund). Specifies that such Fund shall be managed by the FDIC and shall be separately maintained and not commingled. Transfers to such Fund the reserves and assets, debts, obligations, contracts, and other liabilities of the FSLIC existing on the date of the dissolution of the FSLIC. Provides that such Fund shall be funded by: (1) income generated on the assets transferred to it; (2) proceeds of the resolution of insolvent thrift institutions which became insolvent prior to December 31, 1988 (to the extent such funds are not required by the Resolution Funding Corporation); (3) the proceeds from borrowings by the Financing Corporation; and (4) assessments on SAIF members levied prior to December 31, 1991, and not required by the Financing Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation. Provides for additional funding by the Secretary of the Treasury from appropriated funds in the event such other funds are insufficient. Limits any judgment resulting from a civil action against the FSLIC or the FDIC to the assets of such Fund. Dissolves such Fund upon the satisfaction of all debts and liabilities and the sale of all assets acquired in case resolutions. Requires that any funds remaining in such Fund be covered into the Treasury. Requires that any funds held in either the BIF or the SAIF must be invested in U.S. Government obligations or in obligations guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Requires that the funds from the BIF and the SAIF be invested separately and not commingled. Allows the FDIC to request a 90-day stay of any legal proceedings to which it becomes a party due to its acquisition of any asset or in the exercise of certain authorities. Requires the FDIC, in determining whether to provide assistance to financial institutions, to consider: (1) the immediate and long-term obligations of the FDIC with respect to such assistance; and (2) the Federal tax revenues which would be forgone. Provides that transfers of assets or liabilities associated with any trust business may be effected by the FDIC in connection with any asset purchase transaction without any further State or Federal approval. Revises provisions relating to certain agreements against the interests of the FDIC. Specifies that the Board of Directors of the FDIC may act by a 75 percent vote (current law requires a unanimous vote) in order to override a State's objection to an assisted interstate acquisition of an insured financial institution in default having $500,000,000 or more in assets. Revises certain rules relating to the interstate acquisitions of banks. Establishes separate rules relating to the interstate acquisitions of savings associations. Increases the borrowing authority of the FDIC from $3,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000. Makes such borrowing authority subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Limits any State or local tax penalties to which the FDIC may be subjected when acting as a receiver or conservator of a financial institution. Limits the borrowing of both the BIF and the SAIF to 50 percent of net worth or $10,000,000,000, whichever is less. Requires the FDIC to report to the Congress annually regarding its operations, activities, budget, receipts, and expenditures. (Current law requires an annual report regarding only the FDIC's operations.) Requires the FDIC to make quarterly reports to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the Office of Management and Budget with respect to the FDIC's financial operating plans and forecasts. Requires signs displayed by insured financial institutions to represent whether an institution is a BIF member or a SAIF member. Makes all insured financial institutions subject to the Bank Merger Act. Makes the FHLBS the responsible agency with respect to mergers where the acquiring, assuming, or resulting institution is to be a savings association. Provides that all insured State financial institutions, other than State member banks or district banks, would be subject to the requirement of prior FDIC consent to the reduction of capital. Requires any insured savings association which establishes or controls a new company or elects to conduct any new activity to notify the FDIC and the FHLBS. Requires such a savings association to deduct its investments in, and loans to, such company from its own capital for purposes of determining capital adequacy if the company is engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank. Grants the FDIC and the FHLBS certain enforcement powers with respect to any company controlled by an insured savings association. Authorizes the FDIC to determine activities which are incompatible with deposit insurance. Revises the statement of the policy of nondiscrimination against State nonmember banks under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to include State savings associations. Eliminates the requirement of nondiscrimination on account of an institution having capital stock of less than the amount required for Federal Reserve membership. Title III: Savings Association Supervision Improvements - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to specify the duties and responsibilities of the FHLBS with respect to the examination, supervision, and regulation of savings associations. States that such authorities are intended to encourage savings associations to maintain their role of providing credit for housing in a manner consistent with principles of safe and sound operation. Requires the FHLBS to prescribe accounting and disclosure standards for all savings associations. Provides that such standards shall incorporate generally accepted accounting principles to the same degree such principles are used to determine compliance with the rules and regulations of other Federal banking agencies. Requires that the rules, regulations, and policies of the FHLBS governing the operation of savings associations shall be no less stringent than those of the Comptroller of the Currency. Transfers specified provisions of the National Housing Act to the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933. Makes certain conforming name changes and certain technical amendments. Requires the FDIC to be appointed the receiver of insured State savings associations under certain circumstances. Requires insured State savings associations, as well as Federal savings associations, to abide by the rules of the FHLBS when converting from mutual to stock form or from stock to mutual form. Requires the FHLBS to establish for all savings associations capital standards that are no less stringent than those applied to national banks. Allows such capital standards to include goodwill as a component of capital. Specifies that in determining capital adequacy, any investments in, and loans to, a subsidiary engaged solely in mortgage banking activities shall not be deducted from the capital of savings associations. Requires that such capital standards must be fully implemented no later than June 1, 1991. Repeals specified provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 and the National Housing Act which provide capital forbearance to certain insured savings associations. Allows those savings associations operating under a capital forbearance plan previously approved pursuant to such provisions to continue to operate under such plans, provided such associations continue to adhere to such plans and continue to submit required reports. Provides that the expense of the examination of savings associations or their affiliates shall be assessed by the FHLBS upon savings associations in proportion to their assets or resources. Specifies procedures for making such assessments and remedies in cases where an affiliate refuses to pay examination costs, permit examination, or provide required information. Transfers provisions of the National Housing Act concerning the regulation of savings and loan holding companies to the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933. Makes certain technical amendments to such provisions. Imposes certain sanctions upon savings associations that fail to achieve or maintain qualified thrift lender status. Requires such a savings association to convert its charter to a bank charter within three years unless it requalifies within one year. Prohibits such a savings association from engaging in certain activities until such conversion is complete. Treats a holding company which controls such a savings association as a bank holding company for all purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Charges an insurance fund exit fee upon such a conversion. Makes applicable to savings associations certain provisions of the Federal Reserve Act relating to transactions with affiliates and loans and extensions of credit to directors and controlling persons.

Provides that the RTC shall have the same case resolution and financial assistance rights and powers as the FDIC. Specifies that the RTC shall not have the authority to obligate the FDIC or its funds and shall be subject to the same limitations as the FDIC in connection with providing assistance to, or liquidating or otherwise resolving cases involving, insured institutions.

Specifies the conditions under which the FDIC may be appointed as a conservator. Allows an affected bank to seek judicial review of the appointment of a conservator, except in cases where the bank has consented to the appointment of a conservator or the bank's deposit insurance has been terminated. Specifies that the Comptroller of the Currency shall have the exclusive power and jurisdiction to appoint a conservator for the bank.

Title IX: Regulatory Authority and Criminal Enhancements - Enforcement Powers Improvement Act of 1989 - Subtitle A: Regulation of Financial Institutions - Makes technical amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act with respect to a Federal banking agency's authority to impose sanctions on an \"institution-related party\" who participates in the affairs of an insured financial institution (both banks and savings associations.) Reduces from 120 days to 60 days the prior notice the FDIC must give of its intention to terminate a financial institution's deposit insurance. Reduces the period during which deposit insurance is continued in such cases from two years to a period of six months to two years at the discretion of the FDIC. Allows the FDIC to temporarily suspend deposit insurance upon a finding that an insured financial institution has no tangible shareholders' equity that qualifies under the capital guidelines or regulations of the appropriate Federal banking agency. Allows the appropriate Federal banking agency to issue cease and desist orders to require affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from certain violations or practices, including making restitution or reimbursement, providing indemnification, rescinding contracts, disposing of loans, or assets, restricting growth of the institution, or providing guarantees against loss. Allows such an order to limit the activities or functions of the financial institution or any institution-related party. Specifies that the FHLBS may exercise cease and desist authority with respect to savings and loan holding companies, any subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, any service corporation of a savings association, and any subsidiary of any such service corporation. Revises the temporary cease and desist authority of the Federal banking regulatory agencies to delete the requirement that the agency must show a \"substantial\" dissipation of assets or a \"serious\" weakening of the condition of the financial institution. Provides that such a temporary order may place limitations on the activities or functions of the financial institution or prohibitions or restrictions on the growth of the institution or any institution-related party. Allows the use of such temporary cease and desist authority when a financial institution's records are so incomplete or inaccurate that the appropriate banking agency cannot determine the financial condition of the institution. Provides that such an order may require the institution to take such action necessary to restore the records to a complete and accurate state. Revises rules concerning the suspension or removal of any financial institution-related party. Deletes the requirement that the regulatory agency must show activity which results in \"substantial\" financial loss or other damage to the financial institution. Specifies the types of activity to be considered, including activity at any business institution or another financial institution other than the institution in question. (Current law provides for different standards depending on whether the activity took place at another institution or at the particular institution from which removal is sought.) Allows the temporary removal of an institution-related party pending a permanent removal if necessary for the protection of the institution or depositors. Provides that any institution-related party suspended or removed by such an order shall also be suspended or removed or prohibited from participation in the conduct of the affairs of any: (1) insured financial institution; (2) bank holding company or subsidiary; (3) Edge Act corporation; (4) service corporation or subsidiary; (5) savings and loan holding company or subsidiary; (6) federally-insured credit union; and (7) institution chartered under the Farm Credit Act of 1971. Exempts such a person from such industry-wide prohibitions if the appropriate Federal regulatory agency gives prior written approval. Specifies that such authority to proceed against any institution-related party shall not be affected by the resignation, termination of employment, or other separation of such person from an insured financial institution.
