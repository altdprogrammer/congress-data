Allows a settlement of a bona fide claim to occur only if the settlement is knowing and voluntary and only if certain criteria are met. Prohibits any waiver agreement from: (1) affecting EEOC rights and responsibilities to enforce the Act; or (2) being used to justify interfering with the protected right of an employee to file a charge or participate in an EEOC investigation or proceeding. Defines \"bona fide claim,\" for such purposes, as: (1) a charge of age discrimination filed with the EEOC; (2) an action alleging age discrimination filed in court by the individual or the individual's representative; or (3) a specific allegation of age discrimination communicated in writing by the individual or the individual's representative directly to the employer, employment agency, labor organization, or their representatives. Provides that, effective upon the enactment of this Act, a specified rule on waivers issued by the EEOC shall have no force and effect."
