Requires the Postal Service, when determining whether to close or consolidate a post office, to consider whether closing or consolidation may substantially change the character and nature of delivery relative to delivery service for other post offices in the same Postal Service division. Requires the Postal Service to include proposed alternatives for service in any determination to close or consolidate a post office."
