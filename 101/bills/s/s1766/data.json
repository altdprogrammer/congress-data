Requires States to enact legislation recognizing the validity of living wills and written durable powers of attorney. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study and report to the Congress within four years after this Act's enactment assessing this Act's initiatives and further steps which may be taken to advance patient self-determination. Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a national campaign within six months after this Act's enactment informing the public of their options in participating in and directing their medical care."
