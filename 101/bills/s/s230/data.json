    "text": "Learning Disabled Youthful Offender Rehabilitation Act of 1989 - Authorizes programs in the interest of establishing a comprehensive educational and psychosocial prevention and intervention program to reduce the recidivism rate among first-time criminal offenders who are learning disabled. Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to applicant local district attorneys to develop educational programs as an alternative to incarceration for eligible learning disabled defendants. Requires each grant application, to include among other guidelines and criteria: (1) a requirement that the defendant be a first-time misdemeanor offender under age 21 who has been diagnosed as having a treatable learning disability; and (2) procedures to govern local district attorneys' determinations as to suitable candidates for the program. Requires that the defendant be granted a conditional deferred prosecution, plead guilty, and receive a minimum sentence of 100 hours in the educational and vocational program tailored to the defendant's needs. Provides for restoration of the case for sentence execution or further proceedings upon default. Provides for issuance of a bench warrant if a defendant absconds. Authorizes grant fund use for the creation of systems to: (1) identify learning disabled individuals; and (2) hire evaluative and remedial personnel to identify and treat eligible defendants. Requires grant recipients to submit an initial report to the Attorney General (to be followed a year later by a supplemental report). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
