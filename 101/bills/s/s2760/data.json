    "text": "Authorizes appropriations for the Maritime Administration for: (1) operating-differential subsidies; (2) manpower, education, and training; (3) operating programs; (4) national security support capabilities; and (5) the Ready Reserve Force. Amends Federal law to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to make awards (currently, to make research grants) to a National Maritime Enhancement Institute from amounts appropriated (currently, from amounts appropriated under specified provisions). Limits the aggregate annual amount (currently, the aggregate amount) to a specified dollar sum. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to require that the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, be established for a term of two years commencing at the beginning of each Congress. Replaces provisions authorizing the Secretary to acquire suitable vessels in exchange for obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) with provisions authorizing the Secretary to acquire suitable vessels with funds in the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund derived from the sale of obsolete vessels in the NDRF. Allows, notwithstanding specified provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916, vessels sold under these provisions to be scrapped in approved foreign markets. Amends Federal law to prohibit the Secretary from: (1) taking any vessel, currently in service as a State academy training vessel, out of service to implement any alternative program, including ship sharing, until or unless the vessel is incapable of being maintained in good repair as required under provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936; or (2) implementing any training vessel sharing program without first receiving the express consent of the Congress. Extends until October 1, 1994, the effective date of provisions mandating that State maritime academies require passage of a Coast Guard licensing examination as a condition for: (1) graduation by an individual; and (2) any payment or use of any vessel received by such an academy under specified provisions after December 31, 1989. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to recover from an individual the cost of education at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (Academy) if the Secretary of Defense is unable or unwilling to order an individual to active duty under provisions relating to failure to fulfill commitment agreements. Allows the Secretary to permit, in addition to those allowed under other provisions, additional individuals from the Republic of Panama to receive instruction at the Academy. (Current law allows the Secretary to annually permit, until September 30, 1995, in addition to those allowed under other provisions, up to six additional individuals from the Republic of Panama to receive instruction at the Academy.) Requires that the Secretary be reimbursed for the cost of the instruction."
