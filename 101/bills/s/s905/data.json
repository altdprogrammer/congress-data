    "text": "Cable Consumer Protection Act of 1989 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to repeal certain limitations on the authority of a State or local government to regulate the rates for cable television service. Authorizes a State or franchising authority to require the alteration of rates following any change in service by a cable operator (such as the rearrangement of cable service tiers). Requires such State or franchising authority to issue a final decision on such an alteration of rates within 60 days of public notice and opportunity for hearing. Authorizes a State or franchising authority to prohibit the ownership or control of a cable system by a person because of such person's ownership or control of media of mass communications or other media interest, but limits the enforcement of such prohibition to either: (1) granting or denying a renewal of the franchise; or (2) granting or denying an application to transfer ownership or control of the cable system. Amends Federal copyright law with respect to compulsory licensing requirements for the secondary transmission by a State or local franchising authority of a primary transmission made by a broadcast station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require cable system compliance with certain must-carry requirements. Provides that a cable system complies with the must-carry requirements if the FCC certifies that such cable system: (1) carries, as part of their basic tier of cable service, specified signals of television broadcast stations; and (2) carries each station on the cable channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel number assigned to such station by the FCC, or on such other cable channel as may be acceptable to the television broadcast station."
