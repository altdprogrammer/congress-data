Requires such study to consider: (1) establishment of a new unit within the national park system; and (2) various appropriate designations for those routes and sites used by the Underground Railroad, and alternate means to link such sites, including those in Canada and Mexico. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to publish an interpretive handbook on the Underground Railroad in the larger context of American antebellum society (including the history of slavery and abolitionism). Directs the Secretary to establish the Underground Railroad Advisory Committee. Authorizes appropriations."
