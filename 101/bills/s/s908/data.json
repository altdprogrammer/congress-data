    "text": "Fair Lending Oversight and Enforcement Act of 1989 - Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to require depository institutions, as part of the required disclosures relating to mortgage loans, to itemize the number and dollar amount of mortgage loans involving mortgagors or mortgage applicants grouped according to income level, racial characteristics, and gender. Requires depository institutions to include, as part of such disclosures, information concerning mortgage loan applications which were received by the depository institution. (Current law requires disclosure of information concerning only mortgage loans originated, purchased, made, or approved.) Makes such disclosure requirements applicable to all mortgage lenders. Requires depository institutions to include information concerning commercial loans as part of such disclosures. Requires that any information relating to commercial loans be itemized to disclose the number and dollar amount of commercial loans: (1) that are small business loans; (2) that are guaranteed or otherwise sponsored by the Small Business Administration or any other Federal agency; and (3) that involve borrowers or applicants grouped according to income level, racial characteristics, and gender."
