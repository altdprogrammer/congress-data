    "text": "Federal Laboratory Education Partnerships Act of 1990 - Requires each Federal \"mission agency\" to identify each area of scientific academic study critical to its mission and establish or designate: (1) an education office within the agency; and (2) certain programs to assist graduate, undergraduate, secondary, and elementary education in critical academic areas and train agency employees in such areas. Defines Federal \"mission agency\" as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, or any of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor, or Transportation. Requires each Federal laboratory director to enter into education partnership agreements with public schools, colleges, and universities to promote and enhance scientific academic study at all educational levels. Requires mission agency education officials to review such agreements and provide model agreements. Requires each Federal laboratory director to make every effort to reach education partnership agreements with historically black colleges and universities and other public colleges and universities that serve Hispanic and other minority populations. Allows agency or contractor personnel to participate in programs under such agreements. Authorizes each mission agency and Federal laboratory, in carrying out this Act, to conduct or fund educational activities at an agency site, contractor site, or any other appropriate location. Requires each mission agency to report within one year to the Congress and the President on its actions to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
