    "text": "Amends the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act to authorize appropriations to the Secretary of Commerce from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund for FY 1990 through 1999 to: (1) carry out a comprehensive monitoring and research program to determine the long-term effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on the marine and estuarine habitats and resources of Prince William Sound; and (2) apply the results of such monitoring and research to the development of methods to protect arctic and subarctic marine and estuarine environments from accidental discharges of oil. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on such program. Prohibits oil and gas exploration, development, or production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until the Secretary's interim report has been submitted and the Secretary of Transportation assures that significant improvements have been made in the navigation safety of oil tankers in Prince William Sound."
