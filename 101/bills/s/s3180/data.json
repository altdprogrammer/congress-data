    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to allow the court, in determining the sentence to be imposed in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, to consider guidelines or policy statements issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Authorizes the court to resentence a defendant who violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation. Directs the court to revoke supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment up to the maximum authorized if the defendant is found by the court to be in unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Authorizes the court to include a requirement that the defendant be placed on supervised release after imprisonment when a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment less than the maximum authorized. Specifies that the length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed that authorized by statute for the offense of which the defendant was convicted, minus any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release."
