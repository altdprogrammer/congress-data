Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 for: (1) the defense agencies for procurement; (2) the Defense Inspector General; and (3) the chemical demilitarization program (the destruction of lethal chemical weapons in accordance with the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1986). Extends through FY 1991 certain authority provided to the Secretary of Defense in connection with the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System program. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 for the armed forces, the defense agencies, the Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation for research, development, test, and evaluation.

Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 for working capital funds for the armed forces and the defense agencies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 for the Department of Defense Base Closure Account. Title IV: Personnel Authorizations for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 - Part A: Active Forces - Authorizes end strengths for active-duty forces for FY 1990 and 1991. Part B: Reserve Forces - Authorizes end strengths for reserve components of the armed forces for FY 1990 and 1991. Authorizes end strength reductions for the Selected Reserve components of the armed forces for each such fiscal year. Authorizes increases for each such fiscal year in the number of certain personnel authorized to be on active duty in support of the reserve components. Part C: Military Training Student Loads - Authorizes the average military training student loads for FY 1990 and 1991. Provides for the adjustment of such student loads consistent with manpower strengths authorized under this Act. Title V: General Provisions - Repeals the following: (1) the current Federal requirement of a separate budget request for the procurement of equipment for the reserve components of the armed forces; (2) the requirement of a separate authorization of civilian personnel of the Department of Defense (DOD) by end strength; (3) the prohibition on the use of certain personnel management constraints concerning DOD civilian personnel; (4) the procurement requirement and limitation of funds for the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck; (5) the limitation of funds for the Rankine engine; and (6) the limitation on the use of defense operation and maintenance funds for the purchase of investment items. Title VI: National Defense Stockpile - Amends the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act to repeal current law prohibiting a disposal from the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) unless the disposal would result in an unobligated balance in the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund in excess of $100,000,000. Authorizes the President to provide for the rotation of any material in the NDS when necessary to prevent technological obsolescence. Allows the President to replace such obsolete material with a more suitable material. Removes the requirement that disposal of materials in the NDS shall be made for domestic consumption. Authorizes the National Defense Stockpile Manager to effect specified changes in the quantities of materials to be stockpiled in the NDS under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. Authorizes the President to dispose of specified quantities of materials currently held in the NDS, to the extent that such quantities have been determined to be excess to requirements for national defense. Authorizes the National Defense Stockpile Manager, if the President determines it to be necessary to meet threats to the national defense, to obligate specified amounts from the Fund to acquire, refine, or process strategic and critical materials needed to meet established requirements for the NDS on an accelerated basis."
