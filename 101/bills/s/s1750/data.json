Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, during calendar year 1990, to offer to buy butter at no more than $1.10 per pound and nonfat dry milk at $0.8475 per pound. Permits the Secretary to allocate the rate of price support between the purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and butter in any other manner determined to result in the lowest level of expenditures by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Requires notification of the appropriate congressional committees of such a determination. Makes across-the-board reductions in deficiency payments for the 1990 crops of: (1) wheat and corn, by 2.33 cents per bushel; (2) cotton, by .515 cents per pound; and (3) rice, by .515 cents per hundred-weight. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to permit producers to plant soybeans, sunflowers, or safflowers on up to 25 percent of the permitted acreage for 1990 crops of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. Requires the Secretary to reduce such percentage (or even prohibit such plantings) if it is estimated, based on the anticipated additional soybean, sunflower, and safflower plantings, that the average market price for the 1990 soybean crop will be below 115 percent of the loan rate for the 1989 crop. Requires a report to the appropriate congressional committees. Counts any acreage planted to soybeans, sunflowers, or safflowers as acreage planted to the program crop for which they are substituted. Sets forth a sliding-scale of acreage limitations and reductions for the 1990 crop of feed grains. Subtitle B: Agricultural Trade Programs - Prohibits the Commodity Credit Corporation during FY 1990 from making more than $650,000,000 in commodities available to exporters, processors, or foreign importers in order to enhance the export of U.S. commodities by making their prices competitive in the world market.

Changes to every two years after October 1, 1991, the date upon which such Schedule shall be reviewed by the FCC and adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Increases fines and penalties for various failures and noncompliance under the Act. Increases the fines assessed against those who receive from a common carrier a rebate or offset against the regular charges for the transmission of messages or signals. Makes such fines higher for broadcast station licensees or permittees, cable television operators, or applicants for cable television operation. Sets forth penalty amounts if the violator is a common carrier subject to the provisions of the Act or an applicant for a common carrier license. Requires the FCC to assess such forfeiture penalty amount via written notice. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to collect a fee of $3.00 for each passenger on a commercial aircraft departing the United States on international flights during FY 1990. Requires deposit of such fees in the Treasury to offset the Department of Transportation's activities relating to international air transportation operations, including air traffic control operations and aviation security and safety inspections. Amends Federal law to require the Secretary to collect a $3.00 per passenger fee for each covered voyage of a: (1) passenger vessel (with certain exceptions) having specified accommodations on a voyage that extends over one or more nights; or (2) vessel transporting passengers engaged in gambling aboard such vessel beyond the territorial sea of the United States. Targets the use of such fees for harbor maintenance and Coast Guard activities. Requires the Secretary (the Secretary) of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establish a system for the collection of $50,000,000 in FY 1990 from users of Coast Guard services other than those related to emergency search and rescue. Requires the system to include collection of payments from: (1) sales of support of services stamps; and (2) fees charged to users of such specified services who have not purchased such stamps. Requires the Secretary to ensure that such system minimizes adverse economic effects upon commercial towing services and other segments of the maritime industry. Requires a report to the Congress on measurers taken to establish such system. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a schedule of fees to be collected: (1) for each slot issued by the Federal Aviation Administration and held by an air carrier, other than a commuter operator, at high density traffic airports; and (2) for each slot held by a foreign air carrier at such airports, consistent with international law and U.S. treaties.

Title IV: Environment and Public Works - Subtitle A: Atmospheric Pollution Fees - Stratospheric Ozone and Climate Protection Act of 1989 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to impose fees on producers, importers, and distributors of specified ozone-depleting chemicals. Exempts from such fees ozone-depleting chemicals that have been recovered and recycled. Provides for the annual adjustment of such fees. Requires producers or importers of such chemicals to pay base fees for the right to produce or import such chemicals. Sets forth a schedule for the computation of such fees. Authorizes the Administrator to collect fees for other chemicals known or anticipated to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, as appropriate. Permits persons subject to such fees to apply for a fee refund attributable to the quantity of an ozone-depleting chemical exported during the assessment period to a developing country which is a party to the Montreal Protocol. Provides for the deposit of such fees into the Ozone Layer and Climate Protection Trust Fund. Establishes the Ozone Layer and Climate Protection Trust Fund. Makes the Fund available to implement the Montreal Protocol and to carry out this Act and specified EPA activities. Subtitle B: Nuclear Regulatory Commission User Fees - Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985 to remove provisions concerning Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) annual user fee reporting requirements. Raises the maximum amount of such fees that may be charged during FY 1990. Subtitle C: Payments to the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1978 to require fees of three cents (currently, not to exceed such amount) on each barrel of oil from the Outer Continental Shelf.

Reduces the payment rate for oxygen and oxygen equipment for the final three quarters of 1990. Reduces payments for seat-lift chairs or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulators furnished on or after April 1, 1990, by 15 percent. Treats power driven wheelchairs as routinely purchased durable medical equipment for Medicare payment purposes. Requires the Secretary to specify criteria to be used by carriers in deciding on a case by case basis whether to classify power-driven wheelchairs as customized items for payment purposes. Reduces payments for the capital-related costs of FY 1990 outpatient hospital services by 13.5 percent. Part III: Provisions Relating to Parts A and B of Medicare - Amends the Medicare program to extend the periods of days within which claims must be paid under parts A and B of the Medicare program in FY 1990. Exempts any transfer of Federal outlays, receipts, or revenues from FY 1990 to FY 1991 by reason of such extension from the prohibition against counting as savings for deficit reduction purposes the transfer of government actions from one year to another. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the disclosure of taxpayer identification information regarding a Medicare beneficiary for the determination of the extent to which such beneficiary is covered under a group health plan. Amends the Medicare program to require employers to disclose information concerning the status and nature of a beneficiary's coverage under a group health plan of the employer.
