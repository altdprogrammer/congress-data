    "text": "Amends the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 to prohibit: (1) knowingly selling or otherwise transferring, or offering for sale or transfer, any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, or other matter produced with materials which have been mailed or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce or intended for such shipment, which contains one or more visual depictions of actual sexually explicit conduct and which does not have affixed to it a statement of the location of records with respect to the performance depicted on every copy of such matter; or (2) any person to whom such Act applies from failing to create or maintain records required by, or from knowingly failing to comply with provisions of, such Act or from knowingly making a false entry or failing to make an appropriate entry in such records. Deletes provisions providing that proof that a person fails to comply with recordkeeping requirements raises a rebuttable presumption that a performer (i.e., a person depicted engaging in, or assisting another to engage in, sexually explicit conduct) was a minor. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of such Act."
