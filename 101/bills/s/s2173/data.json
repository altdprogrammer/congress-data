    "text": "Defense Base Consolidation Act - Amends Federal armed forces provisions concerning military base closures and realignments to authorize the Secretary of Defense to: (1) carry out actions necessary to implement such closures and realignments; (2) provide economic adjustment assistance and community planning assistance to any community located near a military facility being closed or realigned or where functions of a previous installation are being transferred; (3) carry out environmental restoration and mitigation activities; and (4) provide outplacement assistance to employees separated from facilities being closed or realigned. Directs the Administrator of General Services to delegate to the Secretary certain real property management and disposal authority with respect to property determined to be excess or surplus as a result of the closure or realignment of a military installation. Requires the Secretary, before taking any action with respect to the disposal of such excess or surplus property, to consult with the Governor and the heads of local governments of the State concerned in order to consider any local plan for the use of such property. Requires the proceeds of any such disposals or transfers to be deposited in the Base Closure Account. Outlines instances under which provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 shall and shall not apply to actions taken by the Department of Defense with regard to military base closures and realignments as well as disposals and transfers of property. Provides for the permanent establishment of the Department of Defense Base Closure Account established under the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act. Provides for deposits into the Account. Requires the Secretary, when Account funds are used to carry out a construction project and the cost of the project will exceed the maximum authorized by law for a minor construction project, to notify the Congress and justify such expenditure."
