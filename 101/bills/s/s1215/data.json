Requires such a licensee, on and after such date, to provide public notice to assist interested individuals in identifying programs designed to serve the educational and informational needs of children. Requires the FCC to adopt rules to enforce the above requirements. Gives the FCC authority, after January 1, 1993, to review and evaluate the above requirements and to modify them after notice and public comments. Requires the FCC, when reviewing any application for a television broadcast license renewal, to consider compliance with these advertising standards, as well as the licensee's programming in connection with the educational and information needs of children."
