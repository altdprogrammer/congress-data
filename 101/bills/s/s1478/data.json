    "text": "Water Research Act of 1989 - Declares it U.S. policy to provide for: (1) the development of a means of producing, from saline or biologically impaired waters, water of a quality suitable for agricultural, industrial, municipal and other uses; and (2) related research on a scale sufficient to determine the feasibility of large scale development. Defines \"saline water\" to mean sea water, brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically impaired water. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a basic research and development program as Phase I of the water research program established by this Act. Specifies the activities to be included in Phase I, including activities involving research grants and contracts. Directs the Secretary to endeavor to obtain results in Phase I, within five years after enactment of this Act, sufficient to support recommendations to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct additional basic research and development concurrently with Phase II demonstration activities. Directs the Secretary to conduct a demonstration program as Phase II of the water research program established by this Act. Specifies the activities to be included in Phase II. Requires the results of research under this Act, with exceptions for national defense and patent rights, to be available to the public. Applies specified provisions of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy, Research and Development Act of 1974 (FNERDA) relating to patents and inventions to any invention conceived in the course of any contract under this Act, but states that such application does not affect the application of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act to research under this Act that is performed at a Federal laboratory. Applies provisions of FNERDA relating to antitrust laws to activities under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) accept technical and administrative assistance from public or private agencies in connection with work relating to the desalting of water; (2) enter into contracts or agreements; and (3) provide for cost sharing. Authorizes the Secretary to take other actions in carrying out this Act, including making grants and contracts. Directs the Secretary to dispose of water and byproducts resulting from operations under this Act consistent with environmental law. Requires, notwithstanding other law, moneys received from the dispositions to be deposited in a separate account in the Treasury, to be known as the Water Research Fund. Prohibits expenditure of amounts from the Fund until authorized by Act of appropriation. Authorizes appropriations for Phase I for the fiscal year following enactment of this Act and for each of the four fiscal years thereafter."
