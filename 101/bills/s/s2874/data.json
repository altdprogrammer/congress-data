    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to reformulate the Cedar Bluff Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, Kansas, including reallocation of the conservation capacity of the Cedar Bluff Reservoir, to create: (1) a designated operating pool for fish, wildlife, and recreation purposes, and for groundwater recharge for environmental, domestic, municipal, industrial, and irrigation uses; and (2) a joint-use pool for flood control, water sales, fish, wildlife, and recreation purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with Kansas for the sale, use, and control of the designated operating pool (with the exception of water reserved for Russell, Kansas), and to allow Kansas to acquire use and control of water in the joint-use pool. Provides that Kansas shall not permit utilization of water from Cedar Bluff Reservoir to increase irrigation of lands in the Smoky Hill River Basin from such Reservoir to its confluence with Big Creek. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with Kansas for the acceptance of a specified payment and the State's commitment to pay a proportionate share of the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement charges for the Cedar Bluff Dam and Reservoir, as full satisfaction of the reimbursable costs associated with irrigation of the Cedar Bluff Unit. Requires, after the reformulation authorized by this Act, that any revenues in excess of operating and maintenance expenses received by Kansas from the sale of water from the Cedar Bluff Unit be paid to the United States and covered into the Reclamation Fund if so required under reclamation law. Provides that any additional revenues shall be retained by Kansas, once all such obligations or charges are satisfied. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer ownership of the fish hatchery facility at Cedar Bluff Dam and related water rights to Kansas for its use and operation. Provides that if any transferred property is subsequently transferred from State ownership or used for any purpose other than those provided for in this Act, title to such property shall revert to the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer title to the Cedar Bluff Irrigation District headquarters located near Hays, Kansas, contingent upon the District's agreement to close down the irrigation system to the satisfaction of the Secretary at no additional cost to the United States, after which all easement rights shall revert to the owners of the land to which the easements are attached. Requires the transferee of any interest conveyed pursuant to this Act to assume all liability with respect to such interests and to indemnify the United States against all such liability."
