Requires the Director to appoint a National Advisory Council on Advanced Technician Training. Requires the Director and the Council to report annually on the national advanced technician training program. Requires program coordination with programs of the Department of Commerce and other relevant Federal agencies including the Departments of Labor, Education, and Defense. Requires such program to emphasize advanced technology training programs which: (1) include flexibility in scheduling to accommodate working people and parents; and (2) take steps to meet the adaptive and training needs of handicapped young people and adults. Requires the Director to designate ten centers of excellence among associate-degree-granting colleges: (1) five with exceptional programs of advanced technician training, to serve as national and regional technical education clearinghouses for other colleges; and (2) five that excel in undergraduate education in mathematics and science, to serve as national and regional mathematics and science education clearinghouses for both colleges and secondary schools. Requires the Director to make at least 20 competitive grants annually to associate-degree-granting colleges for partnerships in mathematics and science education with secondary schools in the community served by the college. Authorizes appropriations."
