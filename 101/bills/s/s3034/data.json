    "text": "Public Service Act of 1990 - Title I: Procurement Management Improvements - Adds to the statutory list of functions of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) the role of serving as the President's principal advisor on issues of human resource management in the Government. Directs OPM to develop and implement a plan for decentralizing and delegating to the Federal departments and agencies as many of its current operating responsibilities as practicable. Title II: Recruitment - Directs OPM to establish a program to award scholarships to individuals pursuing a baccalaureate or advanced degree at an institution of higher education to cover annual educational expenses up to $15,000 and to pay such individuals an amount equal to the minimum biweekly rate of basic pay payable for grade GS-2 during each academic term in exchange for an individual's pledge to work for an executive agency before completion of studies and for a period equal to one and one-half times the period of the scholarship. Outlines general requirements for scholarships, including the requirement that OPM take into consideration the need to maintain a balanced workforce in which women and minorities are appropriately represented in Government service. Limits the annual number of scholarships to 1,000. Provides for indexing the $15,000 limitation according to changes in the Consumer Price Index. Codifies the existing Presidential Management Intern Program which currently operates under the authority of executive orders. Authorizes appropriations."
