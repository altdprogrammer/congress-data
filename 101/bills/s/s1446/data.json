Directs the President to prescribe regulations to implement the SSBP. Revises the annuity computation for the survivors of certain retirement-eligible officers who die while on active duty, making such an officer's retired pay rate the rate of pay applicable at the time of death. Defines those persons eligible for such recomputation. Authorizes an eligible retired or former member of the armed forces to participate in the SBP during an open enrollment period. Allows such person, at the same time, to also elect to participate in the SSBP. Defines as eligible a person who on the day before the first day of the open enrollment period is not a participant in the SBP and is either entitled to retired pay or would be so entitled but for the fact that such member or former member is under 60 years of age (for reserve members or former members). Allows a person who is a participant in the SBP but not at the maximum base amount while providing coverage for a dependent child but not for a spouse or former spouse to: (1) elect to participate in the SBP at a higher amount; or (2) elect to provide an annuity under the SBP for a spouse or former spouse. Authorizes current SBP participants to elect to participate in the SSBP during the open enrollment period.
