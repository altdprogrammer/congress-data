    "text": "Building and Construction Industry Labor Law Amendments of 1989 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to provide that in the construction industry two or more business entities engaged primarily in the building and construction industry, performing work within the geographical area covered by a collective bargaining agreement to which any one of the entities is a party, and performing the type of work described in such an agreement, shall be deemed a single employer if they have: (1) substantial common ownership; (2) substantial common management; or (3) substantial common control. Provides that the existence of a contractor-subcontractor relationship shall not be deemed per se to create a single employer or be considered as evidence of direct or indirect common management or control. Applies the terms of a collective bargaining agreement regarding employees of such business entities to all other business entities comprising the same single employer and performing the work described in the agreement within the geographical area covered by the agreement. States that collective bargaining agreements may only be repudiated after the National Labor Relations Board certifies election results in which a majority of the employees select a bargaining representative other than the representative with whom such agreement was made."
