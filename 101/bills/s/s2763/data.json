Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to provide that, in any action brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration involving a scheme to defraud affecting a financial institution, injunctive relief may be granted in conformity with the principles that govern the granting of such relief from threatened loss or damage in other cases. Authorizes the granting of a preliminary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in cases in which an immediate danger of significant loss or damage is shown before a final determination. Authorizes private persons to bring a civil action for relief against those alleged to have defrauded a financial institution, except in limited circumstances."
