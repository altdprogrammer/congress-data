    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-08-03", 
    "text": "Food and Nutrition Labeling Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a food misbranded unless its label bears information concerning its protein, carbohydrate, calorie, and fat content and about vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish exemptions where compliance is impracticable. Requires the Secretary to exempt: (1) fresh fruits and vegetables; (2) foods which are not a meaningful source of nutrients and for which no nutrition or dietary claim or information is otherwise provided; (3) food that is subject to similar labeling requirements; and (4) food prepared and sold in a restaurant or other food service for consumption at the place of sale or elsewhere. Deems a food misbranded, unless its label statements or terms conform to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, if its label bears any statement which: (1) characterizes the nutritional or dietary properties of the food; (2) describes the food in such terms as \"high,\" \"light,\" or \"organic;\" or (3) contains any statement which relates the food to any disease or condition. Directs the Secretary to establish the Human Food Safety and Nutrition Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on issues involving food for human consumption. Prohibits States and local subdivisions from establishing or continuing in effect any food labeling requirement (for food intended for human consumption) unless it is also established pursuant to a statute for which responsibility has been delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Provides for exemptions, by petition, for State labeling requirements meeting compelling and unique local conditions. Allows State and local petitions to the Secretary for the adoption, by regulation, of State or local food labeling requirements as Federal requirements. Allows any State to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Secretary for the purpose of enforcing any State food labeling requirement which is identical to Federal requirements. Requires a State to consult with the Secretary before initiating any enforcement action. Directs the Secretary to implement a nationwide program to educate consumers about the relationship between diet, nutrition, and health, and about the proper interpretation and use of nutritional information and health messages on food labels. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992."
