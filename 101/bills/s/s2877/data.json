    "text": "Cable Viewers Protection Act of 1990 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission to: (1) develop and publish in the Federal Register a list of areas where enforcement of syndicated exclusivity regulations has eliminated programming from crossing U.S. time zones. Exempts cable systems in such areas from being required to delete programming pursuant to such rules between the date such list is published and January 1, 1992. Directs the Commission to complete, and report to the Congress by January 1, 1991, a study of problems caused in cable programming in areas of time zone overlaps, including recommendations on how best to revise regulations to protect the rights of local broadcasters while allowing local residents the opportunity to view programming adversely affected by such rules."
