    "text": "Omnibus Insular Areas Act of 1990 - Title I: Insular Areas Disaster Survival and Recovery Act of 1990 - Insular Areas Disaster Survival and Recovery Act of 1990 - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior for the construction of facilities to protect public health and safety and to enhance the survivability of essential infrastructure in the event of disasters in insular areas. Requires the President to provide technical assistance to insular areas which lack specific capabilities in responding to disasters. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the status of recovery efforts in insular areas declared to be disasters by the President. Requires that the total contributions under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for insular areas not exceed ten percent of the estimated aggregate amounts of grants to be made under such Act for any disaster. Authorizes the President to require a 50 percent local match when making grants in excess of the ten percent ceiling. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to make the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands eligible for relief and assistance. Authorizes appropriations to complete the renovation of the Guam Memorial Hospital. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to grant financial assistance to insular area governments to carry out projects to evaluate the feasibility of, develop options for, and encourage the adoption of efficiency and renewable energy measures which reduce the dependency of such areas on imported fuels, and improve the quality of life in the area. Sets forth applicant requirements for such assistance, and establishes guidelines to determine the amount to be provided. Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year. States that all Federal and territorial environmental laws and regulations shall apply to parcels transferred under this Title during and after such transfer. Title II: Guam Excess Lands Act - Guam Excess Lands Act - Directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to transfer, subject to specified terms and conditions, all right, title, and interest to specified excess Federal lands to Guam for public benefit, by quitclaim deed and without reimbursement. Prohibits such land transfers until 180 days after the submission to specified congressional committees of a required appraisal and land use plan. Requires the conveyance document for any land transferred within six nautical miles of an airport to require a determination of no hazard to air navigation. Authorizes GSA to disallow transfer of any parcel on which there is severe contamination, the remedy of which would require the United States to incur extraordinary costs. Title III: U.S. Insular Areas Water, Sewage, and Power Needs - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to study how the long-term water, sewage, and power needs of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands can be resolved. States that a Freely Associated State Air Carrier shall not be precluded from transportation of persons and property procured, contracted for, or otherwise obtained by a Federal agency or instrumentality under an agreement whereby the agency or instrumentality pays for such transportation without provision for reimbursement."
