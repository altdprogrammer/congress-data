Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive five-year management plan for a research and development program designed to identify and address areas of research critical to the realization of a domestic hydrogen fuel production capability within the shortest time practicable, consistent with market conditions. Requires the Secretary to send the Congress annual plan descriptions including plan modifications. Directs the Secretary to establish a program consistent with the plan. Lists research areas and priority criteria, including a description of the role of the private sector. Directs the Secretary to conduct demonstrations of critical technologies to evaluate technical and nontechnical parameters to determine commercial applicability of hydrogen technology and to prepare a comprehensive large-scale hydrogen demonstration plan. Directs the Secretary, with the advice and help of the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel (composed of industry, academic, and governmental interests), to implement a program in the interest of accelerating broader application of hydrogen technologies by transferring critical technologies to the private sector and by increasing the participation of private sector interests in near commercial applications through joint ventures and other arrangements. Lists the Secretary's duties in connection with the program. Establishes a Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel to advise the Secretary on programs under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1992 through 1994."
