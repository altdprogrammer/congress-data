Permits former Peace Corps employees (who later become Federal employees) to contribute specified percentages of readjustment allowances received for Peace Corps service to their employing agencies in order to retain credit for such service in the computation of Federal retirement benefits. Reduces civil service retirement benefits for former Peace Corps volunteers who receive social security benefits and whose entitlement to an annuity is based on a separation from Federal service before this Act's enactment date."
