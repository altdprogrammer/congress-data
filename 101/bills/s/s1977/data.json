Directs the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) to standardize and develop national grain inspection guidelines. Expresses the sense of the Congress with regard to cooperative enforcement of Federal grain quality and safety standards. Title II: Improving the Cleanliness of Grain Exports - Provides for a phased-in period of export grain quality improvements. Title III: Improving the Physical Soundness and Purity of Export Grain - Directs FGIS to take specified actions to improve the physical soundness and purity of export grain, including an evaluation of existing grade determining factors and limits, and the establishment of new criteria. Title IV: Export Requirements and Standards - States that officially inspected and weighed export grain shall be cargo loaded in a way that favors neither the buyer nor the seller with regard to the delivery contract's requirements. Title V: Classification, Grades and Standards Design Criteria - Directs FGIS to develop for grain an economic value-based classification, grades and standards design framework. Requires a separate designation for grain that includes damage levels, impurities, or other conditions that make it unsuitable for normal use. Title VI: Grain Quality Research and Testing - Expresses the sense of the Congress regarding: (1) end-use performance research; (2) cooperation in objective testing; and (3) grain purity testing. Title VII: Variety Performance Information - Amends the Federal Seed Act to require specification of agronomic and end-use performance to be provided on seed labels of grain. Requires the National Agricultural Statistics Service to compile U.S. grain variety data. Title VIII: Price Support Loan Incentives for Clean Grain - Expresses the sense of the Congress regarding price support loan incentives for clean grain. Title IX: Farmer-Owned Reserve Quality Requirements - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to: (1) require grain forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) under the producer storage program to be at least equal in quality to the original storage collateral; and (2) require the Secretary to establish grain quality standards for such program. Title X: Quality Requirements for Commodity Credit Corporation Owned Grain - Directs the Secretary to establish quality standards for CCC-owned grain. Requires CCC to monitor the condition of stored grain. Title XI: Export Enhancement Program - Amends the Food Security Act to incorporate grain quality incentives in the export enhancement program. Title XII: Crop Insurance Coverage for Loss of Quality - Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to provide grain producers with crop insurance coverage based on loss of quality. Title XIII: Disaster Payments for Loss of Quality - Amends the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 to provide grain producers with disaster payments based on loss of quality.
