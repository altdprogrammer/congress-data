    "text": "Amends the Follow Through Act to direct the Secretary of Education (the Secretary), in making Follow Through program grants, to give priority to any local educational agency (LEA) that requests such a grant to carry out a Follow Through program in a school that: (1) is designated as a schoolwide project in a school with at least a 75 percent enrollment of children from low-income families; and (2) has a high concentration of children from low-income families in kindergarten and primary grades. Revises assistance to Follow Through programs. Prohibits the Secretary from refusing to provide such assistance solely because the applicant proposes to carry out the program during a period in which school is not in regular session and/or at more than one site. Requires the Secretary to provide sufficient funds in making program grants to enable programs to meet requirements to provide comprehensive educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services to aid the continued development of participating children to their full potential. Sets a minimum amount for each grant, if the aggregate amount appropriated for a fiscal year for Follow Through programs exceeds a specified amount. Allows LEAs to use a Follow Through grant to serve all children attending kindergarten through grade three at certain schools. Eliminates certain funding requirements and adds certain other requirements for consideration and contents of program applications, including requirements dealing with bilingual education and education of the handicapped. Provides for Follow Through program improvement through assistance for research, technical assistance and training, and resource and expansion. Directs the Secretary, if program appropriations reach a specified amount, to make a grant to establish a national clearinghouse on Follow Through programs. Revises evaluation provisions to include a comparison of children who receive only services under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) with those who receive such services plus Follow Through services. Revises general and administrative provisions. Authorizes appropriations for Follow Through programs in increasing amounts for FY 1990 through 1994. Sets forth various formulas relating to the use of such funds. Directs the Secretary to facilitate the participation of entities that receive funds for technical assistance and training and resource and expansion purposes under Follow Through programs in training and technical assistance activities under other specified Federal programs assisting elementary school children."
