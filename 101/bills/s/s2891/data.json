Requires the patent issued by the Secretary of the Interior for such lands to reserve in perpetuity public access in and along the Roaring Fork River, Colorado, for fishing and other recreational use. Directs Pitkin and Eagle Counties, Colorado, to convey by quitclaim deed to the Secretary of Agriculture, certain lands owned within and adjacent to the boundaries of the White River National Forest, Colorado. Makes such lands a part of the Forest."
