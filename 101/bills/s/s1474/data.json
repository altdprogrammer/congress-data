Establishes an Oil Terminal Facilities Operations Association for each Program to: (1) establish policies relating to the operation and maintenance of oil terminal facilities which may affect the environment; and (2) provide a forum between the industrial users, owners and operators, the United States, and the State of Alaska for the discussion and resolution of permits, plans, and site-specific regulations governing terminal facilities. Establishes: (1) an Oil Terminal Environmental Advisory Council for each Program to advise and make policy recommendations to the Association; (2) a Monitoring Committee to manage a comprehensive monitoring program of the environmental impacts of such facilities' operations; and (3) a Technical Committee to assess the planning for responding to, containing, and cleaning up oil spills. Requires Federal agencies, prior to taking administrative actions with respect to terminal activities, to consult with the appropriate Council. Authorizes appropriations. Requires: (1) each Council and Association to report to the President and the Congress on its activities; and (2) the General Accounting Office to report to the President and the Congress on the effectiveness of demonstration programs carried out pursuant to this Act."
