    "text": "Pharmacotherapy Development Act of 1990 - Title I: Federal Medication Development Program - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish in the National Institute on Drug Abuse a Medications Development Division (MDD) to: (1) work with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to set new guidelines for the safety and efficacy trials of medications to treat drug addiction and to discuss other measures to facilitate the approval process of drug addiction treatments; (2) promote expanded research programs and studies into the development of medications to treat drug addiction; (3) track the activities of the National Institutes of Health relating to the development and use of pharmacotherapeutic treatments for drug addiction; and (4) take other specified measures to improve pharmacotherapeutic treatment of drug addiction. Establishes reporting requirements by the Director of MDD. Requires the Director of National Drug Control Policy to incorporate reports submitted under this Act into the National Drug Control Strategy. Requires the Director of MDD to provide for proper scientific review of all research grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts over which the Director has authority. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Private Sector Development of Pharmacotherapeutics - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish procedures for the investigation and designation of drugs for the treatment of addictions to illegal drugs. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Medications Review Process Reform - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to permit: (1) an entity submitting an investigational new drug application or protocol for medications to treat drug addiction to provide information required by the Secretary as it becomes available; and (2) parallel track trials to be used for medications to treat drug addiction. Title IV: High Priority Research Areas - Expresses the sense of the Congress that MDD shall devote special attention and resources to achieving the development of a methadone alternative, a long-acting narcotic antagonist, a cocaine blocking treatment, a cocaine-blocker/narcotic antagonist treatment, medications to treat addictions to methamphetamine, and medications to treat pregnant addicts and their fetuses. Title V: Report by the Surgeon General - Requires: (1) the Director of MDD to establish a panel of independent experts in the field of pharmacotherapeutic treatment of drug addiction to assess the national strategy for developing such treatments and make appropriate recommendations; and (2) the Surgeon General of the United States to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report setting forth recommendations of such panel and assessing the progress of the nation toward development of safe, efficacious pharmacological treatments for drug addiction."
