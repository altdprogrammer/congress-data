    "text": "Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and conduct an ongoing SSI outreach program providing low-income aged, blind, and disabled individuals who are not receiving SSI benefits with SSI benefit information and notice of their potential eligibility for Food Stamp and Medicare (title XVIII of the Act) benefits. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and annually report to the Congress on the effectiveness of such program. Excludes specified amounts of interest and dividend income from an individual's income for SSI purposes. Increases the cash value of life insurance and burial fund accounts which is excluded from a beneficiary's resources for SSI purposes. Treats income received on a weekly or biweekly basis as being received on a regular monthly basis at the same annual rate if such treatment would render the payee eligible for SSI benefits."
