    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1990-09-27", 
    "text": "Title I: Vicksburg National Military Park - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the Grant's Canal property in Louisiana and certain specified land owned by Warren County, Mississippi, for inclusion in the Vicksburg National Military Park. Excludes certain lands from such park and retrocedes jurisdiction over such lands to Mississippi. Authorizes the Secretary to convey title to all or part of such excluded lands to an adjacent property owner upon his or her application. Prohibits the conveyance of such property unless certain defined conditions are met. Subjects lands not conveyed pursuant to this Act to transfer or disposition. Requires the Secretary to interpret the campaign and seige of Vicksburg from April 1862 to July 4, 1863, and the history of Vicksburg under Union occupation during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Minnesota Public Lands - Minnesota Public Lands Improvement Act of 1990 - Grants to Minnesota the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to certain public uplands and islands in Minnesota waters which were not subject to any claim as of 180 days after enactment of this Act. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to sell certain other lands which were subject to a claim identified on the records of the Bureau of Land Management as of that date to the claimants following resolution of conflicting claims except in certain circumstances. Deems title to public lands which, on the date of enactment of this Act, were subject to leases issued to Minnesota under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act to have vested in the State and to be exempt from Department of the Interior regulations governing leases under such Act. Allows the State to receive, under this Act, lands previously patented to the State under such Act by notifying the Secretary that it intends to relinquish such lands to the United States. Requires the Secretary to transfer such lands back to the State subject to the provisions of this Act, effective simultaneously with the State's relinquishment of such lands. Authorizes the Secretary to sell and issue a patent to a tract of public land located in Minnesota where the Secretary determines that: (1) such tract does not exceed 1,500 acres and is difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands and is not suitable for management by another Federal department or agency; and (2) such sale would not be inconsistent with land use plans developed in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Allows the Secretary, following adjudication of any claims, to convey such land at fair market value, less equities presented by an applicant for such conveyance (such as the amount paid for the land, longevity of the applicant's claim, and taxes paid on the land) and less the value of any improvements. Provides for description of tracts of such land conveyed on the approved Federal plat of survey. Authorizes the Secretary to either: (1) convey title to a qualified trustee, where a tract does not conform to an existing survey plat, in order to conform the legal description to such plat; or (2) require the applicant to reimburse the United States for the cost of preparing a plat of survey. Prohibits the sale of such lands unless the Secretary, before 30 days prior to such sale, publishes notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the tract is located. Reserves to the United States all mineral rights in the lands transferred under this Act. Prohibits the conveyance or transfer of such lands by Minnesota to any person or entity other than the United States or a political subdivision of the State. Authorizes the use of such lands only for purposes of public recreation or protection of fish, wildlife, plants, or other natural resources and values. Specifies conditions under which conveyed lands shall revert to the United States. Directs the Secretary to take steps to notify Minnesota residents of the uplands and islands to be granted or otherwise transferred to the State. Requires Minnesota to notify the Secretary with regard to any grant or transfer of such lands by the State to a political subdivision. Requires the State to submit to the Secretary a report within five years of enactment of this Act, and every five years thereafter, as to the present ownership, management, and use of the lands granted or otherwise transferred. Sets forth enforcement procedures. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the State with respect to fish and wildlife in any lands granted or transferred to the State under this Act. Title III: Florence Brown Relief Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer, without consideration, to Florence F. Brown of Goleta, California, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a certain parcel of land in the Los Padres National Forest, California."
