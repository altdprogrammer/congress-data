Gives priority to programs which show potential as models and which serve families with the greatest need of assistance. Makes eligible for such grants State or local educational agencies, individual schools, nonprofit private organizations, institutions of higher education, and businesses. Directs the Secretary to establish and operate by grant or contract with a specified kind of nonprofit organization, a National Advisory Center for Parents as Partners in Learning, to provide technical assistance, staff training, and model materials for PPL programs. Directs the Secretary to evaluate such grants annually. Sets forth a gradually declining Federal share of program costs in grant payments. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1993."
