    "text": "Colorado Heritage Preservation Act - Title I: Wilderness Areas - Designates certain areas in specified Colorado national forests as wilderness areas. Amends the Endangered American Wilderness Act of 1978 and other Federal law to repeal the mandates for study of certain potential wilderness areas. Declares that certain Bureau of Land Management wilderness areas in Colorado under study as potential additions to the System have been adequately studied for designation as wilderness areas pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1979. Title II: National Recreation Areas - Establishes certain areas in specified Colorado national forests as recreation areas. Title III: Water - Declares that there is to be no reservation of water rights on designated wilderness or recreation areas. Sets forth the means by which the United States can reserve water rights in such areas. Title IV: Administrative Provisions - Provides for administration of the newly designated wilderness and recreation areas. Title V: Study of Management Problems Within Existing Wilderness Areas in Colorado - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to submit to the Congress a report on management problems associated with valid existing rights, including private inholdings, easements, rights-of-way, and access to those rights, that are located in the designated wilderness areas."
