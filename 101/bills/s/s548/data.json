    "text": "Amends Federal provisions relating to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to contract with any U.S. citizen for the inclusion or incorporation of defense features (equipment or features which ensure the interoperability of such aircraft with the Department of Defense airlift system) in any new or existing aircraft to be owned or controlled by that citizen, and to contract with U.S. aircraft manufacturers for the inclusion or incorporation of defense features in new aircraft to be operated by a U.S. air carrier. Requires the contractor to repay the amount paid by the United States if the defense features specified in the contract are rendered unusable or are removed from the aircraft. Allows any such contract to include a provision authorizing the Secretary: (1) with the concurrence of the contractor, to contract directly with another person for the performance of the work necessary for the inclusion or incorporation of defense features in such aircraft; and (2) to pay such other person directly for such work."
