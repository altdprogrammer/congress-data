    "text": "Medicaid Children's Health Improvement Act of 1989 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to give States the option of covering children under age five whose family income does not exceed 185 percent of the Federal poverty level and covering children age five through seven whose family income does not exceed the Federal poverty level. Authorizes States to provide Medicaid coverage to children under age 21 during a presumptive eligibility period. Requires that such children apply for Medicaid within a State specified number of days after the determination, on the basis of preliminary income information, that such children are presumptively eligible. Allows States to provide Medicaid coverage to foster children under age 21 whose incomes do not exceed the Federal poverty level. Prohibits a State from discontinuing the Medicaid coverage of a child under age 21 due to a change in the eligibility status of the child's family until the State determines that such child is not eligible on a basis other than the basis upon which the child is currently receiving assistance. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by July 1, 1990, on State error rates in determining the Medicaid eligibility of children under age 21. Suspends error rate penalties attributable to payments made on behalf of such children from July 1, 1989, to the first calendar quarter beginning more than 12 months after receipt of the Secretary's error rate report. Requires that States set Medicaid payment rates at levels sufficient to induce enough providers to participate in Medicaid so that services are available to Medicaid beneficiaries to the same extent they are available to the general population. Directs each State to annually submit for the Secretary's approval an amendment to its Medicaid plan which sets forth the payment rates to be used for pediatric services for children under age 21, including certain data to assist the Secretary in evaluating the sufficiency of such payments. Prohibits this Act from being construed as prohibiting higher payment levels for pediatric services furnished in rural areas than those furnished in urban areas. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress by July 1, 1990, on providers and inpatient hospital departments serving Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21. Includes in such report: (1) information on the financial viability of such providers and their relationship to other publicly financed programs; (2) information on reimbursement methodologies; and (3) recommendations or methods to improve provider reimbursement methodologies and participation in the Medicaid program. Requires that Medicaid payment rates for outpatient hospital services take into account the situation of hospitals serving a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs in their outpatient departments. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, within one year after this Act's enactment, on the effects of such requirement. Provides for the establishment of State demonstration projects using innovative approaches to: (1) improve the coordination of health services provided to pregnant women and children under age 21 under titles V (Maternal and Child Health Services) and XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act and the special supplemental food program for women, infants and children (WIC) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and (2) increase provider participation in delivering early and periodic screening and diagnostic services to improve the detection and provide for the early treatment of mental and physical defects in Medicaid children. Increases the Federal medical assistance percentage for project expenditures by 25 percent. Limits aggregate project expenditures in FY 1990. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, by March 1, 1992, on such projects and on how their results may be used to lower infant mortality and morbidity by improving the access of indigent pregnant women and infants to physician services."
