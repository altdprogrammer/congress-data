Requires the Secretary, if an authorized use is threatened with adverse impact by the operation of the system, to implement operational changes to prevent or mitigate such impact unless the potential impacts of the preventive or mitigative action requested by the affected State or tribe outweigh the environmental and economic impacts. Directs the Secretary to make grants to affected States or tribes for: (1) mitigating impacts in the system incurred as a result of implemented or denied operational adjustments; and (2) constructing specified facilities. Authorizes appropriations."
