Requires the USTR to take specified action under the Act if he or she determines that such country is in material noncompliance with any agreement or is denying mutually advantageous market opportunities to U.S. firms. Directs the USTR, in the event of an affirmative determination, to evaluate the overall trade performance of such country. Requires the USTR to develop, during the course of a determination or evaluation, a list of possible sanctions against a country which is noncompliant or which denies U.S. firms market opportunities."
