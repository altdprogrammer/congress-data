Changes reporting requirements from annual to biennial for reports required under the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 concerning: (1) munitions and aircraft shelters for NATO; and (2) allied contributions to the common defense of NATO countries. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to change from 48 hours to five days the time within which the President must report to the Congress on changes in status of significant hostilities or terrorist acts which may endanger American lives or property and which involve a country in which U.S. personnel are performing security assistance functions."
