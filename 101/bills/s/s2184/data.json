Permits such financing only if at least 95 percent of the proceeds of the debt issuance will be used for: (1) the construction portion of a program for the rehabilitation or expansion of the treatment works; or (2) the establishment of financial mechanisms to subsidize or stabilize rates, provide for equipment repair or replacement, or provide for other uses that benefit the ratepayers of the treatment works. Authorizes such financing only if the owner of the treatment works obtains a prior determination from the State agency responsible for administering the State water pollution control revolving fund that the proceeds will be used for such purposes. Permits State water pollution control revolving funds to be used to guarantee, or purchase insurance or letters of credit for, local obligations for equipment, facilities, or plants to be used in conjunction with treatment works."
