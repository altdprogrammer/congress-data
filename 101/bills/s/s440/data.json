    "text": "Health Care for Children Act of 1989 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to phase-in, by FY 1994, the mandatory Medicaid coverage of children whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Eliminates the Medicaid resource eligibility test for poor pregnant women and children. Authorizes States to provide Medicaid assistance to children during a presumptive eligibility period which begins when a provider makes a preliminary determination that the income eligibility test has been met and ends, at the latest, 45 days after such preliminary determination. Requires children to apply for such assistance within 14 days of such preliminary determination. Requires that Medicaid reimbursements be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the Medicaid program at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population. Requires States to annually submit: (1) their payment rates for Medicaid care to pregnant women and children for the Secretary of Health and Human Services' approval; and (2) other specified data to assist the Secretary in evaluating the adequacy of Medicaid payments for such services. Authorizes States to continue Medicaid coverage of pregnant women and children for one year after a change in their family income would otherwise render them ineligible for such coverage. Requires States to provide such continued coverage to pregnant women through the month in which the 60-day period following their pregnancy expires."
