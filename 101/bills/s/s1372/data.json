Requires the terminal operators, vessel operators, and other parties directly involved in the transport of oil or hazardous substances within the area to prepare such plan and submit it to the President for approval on a periodic or regular basis. Requires the President to report to the Congress on the state of the technology, procedures, and research which are available on means of preventing, containing, and removing discharges of oil and hazardous substances into areas affected by this Act. Authorizes the President to deny entry into any U.S. port of any vessel involved in the transport of oil or hazardous substances, or deny movement of oil or hazardous substance through any terminal facility, if the vessel operator or terminal operator does not have in effect a current local contingency plan."
