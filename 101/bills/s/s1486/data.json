Permits skilled nursing facilities to have a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist working in collaboration with a physician, rather than a physician, available to supervise care and furnish emergency care. Covers the reasonable charge (set at 75 percent of the prevailing charge in the locality) for skilled nursing facility services provided by a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide Medicaid coverage of intermediate care and skilled nursing facility services furnished by a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist working in collaboration with a physician. Permits Medicaid nursing facilities to have a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist working in collaboration with a physician, rather than a physician, available to supervise care and furnish emergency care. Requires that this Act be implemented in a budget neutral manner."
