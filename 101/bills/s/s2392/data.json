    "text": "Farm Stewardship Act of 1990 - Title I: Soil Conservation - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the conservation reserve program through 1995. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish national sustainable soil loss goals. Title II: Water Conservation - Makes a person (after January 1, 1985) ineligible for specified agricultural program benefits if such person: (1) has violated Federal or State ground or surface water quality standards for two or more successive years; and (2) has not applied a required conservation plan. Title III: Wetlands Conservation - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to make a violation of the wetland conservation program effective upon conversion of wetland. (Currently a violation is effective upon crop production.) Establishes a graduated penalty for first-time violations if such wetland is restored or mitigated within one year as provided for by this Act. Prohibits the use of Federal funds or credit for wetland conversion. Provides for wetland inclusion in the farm stewardship program established by this Act. Amends the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act to provide cost sharing assistance to landowners for permanent easements for watershed protection, flood prevention, and wildlife habitat activities. Title IV: Wildlife Conservation - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend through crop year 1995 multiyear set aside authority. Requires a producer to designate the same cropland each year for all set-aside programs, except as necessary for crop rotation or farm operation changes. Title V: Farm Stewardship Program - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary to establish a farm stewardship program to assist producers in protecting fragile natural resources of high public value as well as farm natural resources through permanent conservation easements. Provides for cost sharing assistance. Sets forth categories of eligible lands as follows: (1) highly erodible land as of 1996; (2) croplands that may affect surface or groundwater quality; (3) certain wetlands; (4) wildlife habitats; and (5) fragile natural resources. Directs the Secretary to designate easement managers. Authorizes limited economic use of such land where appropriate. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Water Bank Act to include permanent conservation easements among water bank agreement provisions. Title VI: Whole-Farm Conservation Plans - Directs the Secretary to provide a requesting producer with technical assistance in preparing a whole-farm conservation plan, which shall identify and assess: (1) cost-effective conservation practices; (2) best management practices; (3) wildlife habitats; (4) wetlands, flood plains, and riparian areas; and (5) farm objectives and related practices. Title VII: Debt for Nature - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to provide that: (1) conservation easements on land securing a loan under such Act shall be acquired prior to any loan restructuring; and (2) such land shall be enrolled in the farm stewardship program. Requires: (1) the Secretary to acquire permanent conservation easements on Federal inventory land before disposing of it; and (2) such land to be enrolled in the farm stewardship program. Requires that before receiving an agricultural loan, any land owned by a borrower that contains fragile natural resources shall be: (1) permanently protected by a conservation easement; or (2) held by the Government as collateral for such loan. Requires such land to be enrolled in the farm stewardship program. Title VIII: State Technical Committees - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary to establish in each State a State Technical Committee relating to conservation measure implementation."
