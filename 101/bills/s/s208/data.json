Requires the termination of U.S. assistance to the aerospace programs of China within one year of the enactment of this Act. Specifies that such termination shall include: (1) a prohibition on the transfer of avionics for military aircraft; and (2) the revocation of licenses for the export of satellites employing U.S. technology for launch by Chinese missiles. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions for any year in which he certifies to the Congress that China has: (1) not supplied any missiles to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, or Saudi Arabia during the preceding year; and (2) provided reliable assurances that no future transfers of missiles to such countries are planned."
