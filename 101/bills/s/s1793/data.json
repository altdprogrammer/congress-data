    "as": "Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment",

    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a percentage reduction of less than five percent for the 1990 oat crop. Directs the Commodity Credit Corporation to make funds available to promote U.S. meat exports to military commissaries in the European Community. Amends the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act to set forth \"aggregate number of hens\" provisions for individual, general partnership, and corporation producers for purposes of specified exemptions under such Act. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, to require the quality inspection of all peanuts if a marketing agreement is in effect (regardless of whether the particular handler is participating in the agreement). Prohibits the sale for human consumption of peanuts that fail to meet the quality requirements of an agreement. Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to authorize research into new commercial products from natural plant materials. Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to set forth the formula for calculating Farm Credit System (FCS) institution insurance premiums. Makes October 1, 1992, the effective date for certain FCS institution stock purchase requirements. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to exempt certain Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation interest payments from Treasury sequestration. Amends the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 to make earthquake losses in ornamentals, orchards, forest crops, and rural business enterprises eligible for disaster assistance under such Act. Increases such rural business enterprise assistance limits to $300,000,000 (currently, $200,000,000). Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to extend through FY 1990 the exclusion of third party payments for certain housing without cooking or refrigerated storage facilities from household income for purposes of food stamp program eligibility. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, with respect to the 1989 and subsequent crops of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) allow producers to provide county committees with actual crop yield data; (2) notify producers of such opportunity; and (3) maintain such data for at least five crop years. Requires the Secretary, with respect to the 1989 crop year, to determine the impact on producers and commodity programs of alternative methods of determining payment yields for such crops. Directs the Secretary to report the results of such determination to the appropriate congressional committees by January 30, 1990. Permits 1989 and 1990 soybean producers to provide county committees with actual crop yield data. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to permit specified issuers of Rural Development Insurance Fund obligations to purchase such unsold obligations during a 150-day period from the date of enactment of this Act. Conditions eligibility for certain agricultural export benefits on the U.S. exporter's certifying that none of such domestic commodity exports shall be used as the basis for import drawbacks (reimbursement) under the Tariff Act of 1930. Requires U.S. vegetable oil or vegetable oil products exporters to comply with this Act. Exempts contracts entered into before the effective date of this Act. Delays the repayment of advance deficiency payments for 1988 producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice who qualified for specified disaster assistance relief."
