    "text": "Minor Use Pesticides Act of 1990 - Title I: Registration of Pesticides for Agricultural Minor Uses - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to authorize agricultural producers, in the case of pesticides registered for minor agricultural uses, to waive any liability incurred with respect to the use of such pesticides for the pesticide registrants. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce or waive registration fees for such pesticides if the fees would reduce their availability. Requires the Administrator, in the case of such pesticides, to take specified administrative actions if the cancellation or amendment of the registration of such pesticides would adversely affect availability. Provides for transfers of registrations of such pesticides (subject to the Administrator's approval), in lieu of cancelling or amending the registration, unless the use of the pesticides would pose adverse environmental effects. Directs the Administrator to identify pests affecting minor use crops that must be brought under control and control measures for such pests. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to the Administrator on: (1) such pests and control measures; (2) areas of pest control at risk of losing effectiveness due to an insufficient number of registered pesticides or pest resistance; and (3) research efforts to develop pest control to address such areas. Directs the Administrator to develop integrated pest management approaches to respond to the needs of producers who use pesticides for minor agricultural uses. Title II: Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4 Program) - Requires the Secretary to establish an Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4 to assist in the collection of residue and efficacy data in support of: (1) registration or reregistration of minor use pesticides under FIFRA; and (2) tolerances for residues of minor use chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop analytical techniques applicable to residues of minor use pesticides; and (2) participate in research aimed at reducing such residues. Authorizes appropriations."
