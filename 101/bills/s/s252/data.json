    "date": "1989-01-25", 
    "text": "Save American Jobs Act of 1989 - Requires an employer to notify the Secretary of Labor at least 120 days before an intended relocation of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within such a site, from the United States to a foreign country. Limits such requirement to any business enterprise that employs: (1) 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; or (2) 50 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 2,000 hours per week (excluding overtime). Sets forth a civil penalty. Directs the Secretary to: (1) compile a semiannual list of all employers that carry out such relocations; and (2) distribute such list to all Federal agencies (i.e. executive agencies and military departments). Makes an employer who appears on such list ineligible, except in specified circumstances, for any direct or indirect Federal grant or guaranteed loan for five years after the date of the list's publication. Directs each Federal agency head, when awarding a civilian or defense-related contract, to give preference to a U.S. employer that does not appear on such list."
