Directs the EPA Administrator to issue final environmental transuranic waste disposal standards. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the State of New Mexico regarding WIPP-related business and employment opportunities. Provides for payment in lieu of taxes to the State of New Mexico and each local governmental unit for WIPP-related activities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into negotiations regarding just compensation for the holder of a specified Federal potash lease; (2) submit a WIPP decommissioning plan to the Congress within five years after enactment of this Act; and (3) publish in the Federal Register a plan for WIPP land use and management following such decommissioning."
