    "text": "Amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act to increase the percentage of State vocational education assistance funds reserved for programs for Indians and Native Hawaiians. Requires the Secretary of Education to give special consideration to grants which encourage tribal economic development plans. Directs the Secretary to enter into matching grant contracts with Indian tribes. Earmarks specified amounts for vocational-technical training grants to the Crownpoint Institute of Technology in New Mexico and the United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota. Requires the Secretary, if any reserved funds for vocational education grants remain after reservations are made, to make grants first to institutions of higher education eligible for assistance under the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 for tribal economic development programs. Authorizes the Secretary to approve a single application from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium if no such institution applies for a grant. Directs the Secretary to transfer to the Secretary of the Interior a portion of reserved funds for activities (other than construction or alteration of facilities) for the benefit of students attending secondary schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide a matching amount for such activities. Establishes the National Indian Center for Research in Vocational-Technical Training. Requires the Secretary to support the Center through an annual grant. Directs the Secretary to designate the entity to be the Center for a period of five years. Requires the Center to conduct research and developmental programs on: (1) the involvement of the private sector in vocational-technical training for Indians and Alaska Natives; (2) methods for providing quality vocational-technical training to Indians and Alaska Natives and for enhancing basic academic skills; (3) development of curricula on new technologies and assessments of change in the workplace and its impact on tribal settings and economic development; and (4) identification of institutional, social, and cultural characteristics which improve the preparation of youths and adults for employment. Directs the Center to: (1) research the relationship between training and employment opportunities in tribal economic development; (2) provide leadership development through an advanced study center and inservice vocational-technical activities for tribal and local leaders; (3) disseminate research results; (4) provide information to facilitate national planning and policy; (5) provide technical assistance to programs serving Indians and Alaska Natives; (6) act as a clearinghouse for information on contracts and grants; (7) work with tribal organizations, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other public agencies to develop planning and evaluation of programs; and (8) report annually to the Congress and the Secretaries of Education, Labor, and the Interior."
