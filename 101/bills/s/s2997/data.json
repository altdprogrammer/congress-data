    "text": "Family Planning Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that voluntary family planning projects receiving grants or contracts under provisions of that Act offer adoption referral services. Requires the services to be nondiscriminatory as to race, color, religion, and national origin. Removes provisions allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reduce the amount of the grant by the value of supplies or equipment furnished by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. Repeals existing formula grant provisions. Authorizes appropriations for technical assistance and personnel training, including clinical training for obstetric-gynecologic nurse practitioners and training for educators and counselors. States that research grants and contracts may be made for evaluation as well as for development of contraceptives, and to improve clinical management and direct delivery of family planning services. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct, make grants, and enter into contracts for applied research into the development, evaluation, and bringing to the marketplace of contraceptive devices, drugs, and methods. Authorizes appropriations. Defines \"contraceptive\" to include methods which prevent fertilization or implantation in the uterus. Excludes from the definition any drug, device, or method which terminates the pregnancy after implantation, and prohibits the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development from supporting research on any such drug, device, or method. Directs the Secretary to collect data annually on: (1) the number of low-income and marginal-income individuals and adolescents at risk of unintended pregnancies; (2) the sources of funding available for family planning services in the United States; (3) the numbers and age, gender, race, and family income of persons who receive family planning services; and (4) the types of services chosen by individuals receiving services. Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to population research and voluntary family planning programs to require that all grantees receiving assistance under those provisions provide education to patients concerning self breast examinations. Directs the Secretary to make available a specified sum during FY 1991 through 1993 for the selection of a single State in which to establish a research project to determine the impact of family planning services in a State that has in effect a law prohibiting the use of public funds for family planning services to an unmarried minor without the prior written consent of the parent or guardian of the minor. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and enter into contracts with public agencies in such a State for the provision of family planning services, carried out in accordance with such State law. Requires a public agency applicant for a grant or contract to include in the application assurances that: (1) for the fiscal year for which the application is submitted, such State law will not be applied to family planning services provided by private agencies; and (2) if a public agency of the State makes a grant to, or enters into a contract with, a private agency for family planning services, and the grant or contract is funded in whole or in part under these provisions, the State shall ensure that the private agency meets the same requirements for eligibility for assistance under title X (Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs) of the Public Health Service Act as the Secretary may prescribe for all private agencies assisted under such title. Authorizes appropriations to carry out title XX (Adolescent Family Life Demonstration Projects) of the Public Health Service Act."
