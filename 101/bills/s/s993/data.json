Amends the Federal criminal code to impose criminal penalties upon anyone who knowingly develops, produces, stockpiles, transfers, acquires, retains, or possesses any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system for use as a weapon or assists a foreign state or any organization to do so. Provides for extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense committed by or against a U.S. national. Authorizes the Attorney General to request the issuance of a warrant authorizing the seizure of any such agent, toxin, or delivery system that exists by reason of conduct prohibited under this Act or that is of a type or in a quantity that has no apparent justification for prohylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes. Authorizes the seizure and destruction of such an agent, toxin, or delivery system upon probable cause without a warrant in exigent circumstances. Establishes as an affirmative defense against forfeiture that such agent, toxin, or delivery system is for a peaceful purpose and is of a type or quantity reasonable for that purpose. Authorizes the United States to obtain an injunction against conduct prohibited by this Act. Authorizes the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications related to biological weapons offenses under specified conditions."
