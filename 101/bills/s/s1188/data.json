    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit disclosure to the Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) of income-related tax return information for the purpose of determining eligibility for specified veterans' pension and benefit programs. Amends Federal law to prohibit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from using this tax return information to terminate, deny, suspend, or reduce a person's benefits or services without first: (1) taking appropriate steps to verify independently the amount and accessibility of the income in question; and (2) providing the affected individual with notice and an opportunity to respond to the findings. Restricts the Secretary's right to verify or act upon information relating to disability compensation. Directs the Secretary, in furnishing hospital or nursing home care to a veteran who furnishes income information, to notify the veteran that the Secretary may verify such information through the Commissioner of Social Security or the Secretary of the Treasury. Requires the veteran to agree to pay to the United States the applicable amount as payment for such care if it is determined that the veteran is not entitled to such care through the Department in whole or in part. Directs the Secretary to notify applicants for, and recipients of, Department benefits that income information they provide may be compared with tax return data."
