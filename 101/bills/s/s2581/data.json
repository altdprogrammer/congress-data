    "text": "Democracy Fund Act of 1990 - Authorizes the President, with respect to East European countries, to assist: (1) the structural adjustment of Eastern European economies to promote free market principles, monetary stability, and the disposition of international debt; (2) the development of the private sector and the promotion of U.S. trade and investment; (3) the promotion of educational, legal, cultural, and scientific exchanges; (4) the protection and restoration of the environment; (5) international efforts to promote political and economic reform; and (6) support for democratic institutions, political pluralism, and human rights. Authorizes appropriations. Makes an East European country ineligible to receive U.S. assistance during FY 1990 and 1991 unless the Secretary of State certifies that such country is making progress in: (1) complying with commitments made in the Helsinki Final Act and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe; (2) establishing the rule of law and democratic institutions responsive to the will of the people; (3) achieving monetary stabilization, price reform, and free market policies; and (4) shifting economic activities from the state to the private sector. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to direct U.S. executive directors of multilateral financial institutions to oppose financial assistance to any East European country which is not eligible for U.S. assistance."
