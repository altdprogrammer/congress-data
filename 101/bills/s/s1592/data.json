Authorizes appropriations for such grants from amounts transferred to the Employment Security Administration Account. Requires recipient States to establish a job center network program and a system of community-based job centers, to administer it at the local level, and to report annually to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to submit an interim report to the Congress on the demonstration program within two years, and a final report within four years. Requires each entity receiving Federal financial assistance for economic development to provide State public employment service offices with regularly updated listings of its job vacancies related to assisted activities."
