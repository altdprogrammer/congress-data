    "text": "Mining Law of 1989 - Title I: Definitions - Defines the terms used in this Act. Title II: Disposition of Mineral Deposits - Authorizes prospecting on locatable lands subject to the regulations of the Federal surface managing agency. Declares that all locatable lands shall be open for location of an exploration claim. Limits claims to 20 acres. Sets forth the filing requirements for exploration claims and mineral patent applications (including minimum expenditure requirements). Authorizes the use of Federal surface lands if the Secretary of the Interior determines that such lands are required to support mineral development and production activities. Reserves to the United States all rights and interests in locatable lands (except hardrock minerals covered by a valid mineral patent). Title III: Environmental Protection - Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations insuring that mineral prospecting and development are conducted in a manner which minimizes adverse impacts on the environment and complies with Federal and State land resource management plans. Sets forth land reclamation guidelines. Requires the owner of an exploration claim or mineral patent to file a performance bond sufficient to insure complete and timely reclamation of the mined area. Title IV: Disposition of Receipts - Outlines a receipts disposition scheme under which the Secretary of the Treasury pays to the State within which the hardrock mineral deposit boundaries are located 50 percent of specified receipts. Title V: Existing Claims - Imposes a moratorium for new mining claims and patents under the Mining Law of 1872. Requires the owner of a valid mining claim to elect either to relocate the claim under this Act or to maintain it under certain other laws and in keeping with specified requirements (including specified annual assessment work payments)."
