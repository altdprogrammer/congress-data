    "text": "Judicial Integrity and Independence Act of 1989 - Authorizes the Attorney General to petition the Chief Justice of the United States to appoint three judges within the Federal judiciary to determine whether a Federal judge (other than the Chief Justice or an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court) has engaged in conduct constituting a felony under U.S. law and should be removed from office for lack of good behavior. Requires the Chief Justice to make the requested appointments within 30 days after receipt of the petition. Authorizes the Attorney General, within 30 days after receiving notification of appointment of the three-judge court, to file a civil action to remove an accused judge. Specifies that a Federal judge is removable under this Act only by unanimous vote of such court and that such decision shall be final and unreviewable. Abates any civil removal action if the House of Representatives votes an article of impeachment against the accused judge. Makes the civil removal powers of this Act inapplicable to Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court."
