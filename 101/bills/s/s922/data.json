    "text": "Social Security Trust Funds Saving Act of 1989 - Instructs the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to submit to the Congress annually for FY 1994 through 1996 an estimate of the Federal deficit, excluding Social Security trust fund amounts. Establishes maximum deficit amounts for these same fiscal years. Decreases employer and employee taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and self-employment taxes from 6.2 percent to 5.1 percent for a specified period of time if the CBO estimate exceeds these maximums. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to effect a corresponding decrease in employment tax allocations to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Prescribes a timetable for the progressive increase of these tax rates following any necessary decrease in accordance with this Act."
