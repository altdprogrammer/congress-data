    "text": "Telephone Operator Service Consumer Protection Act of 1989 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission to initiate, within 30 days, a proceeding under the Communications Act of 1934 to establish regulations to protect from unfair and deceptive practices consumers who use operator services to place interstate telephone calls and to ensure that consumers have the opportunity to make informed choices in making such calls. Provides for the timing and content of such regulations, including certain minimum requirements. Directs the Commission, in making the regulations, to consider the need to prescribe compensation, other than advance payment by consumers, for owners of competitive public pay telephones for calls routed to carriers other than the designated provider of operator services. Directs the Commission to require each provider of operator service to file an informational tariff specifying rates, terms, and conditions with respect to calls for which operator services are provided. Directs the Commission to require any provider whose rates and charges appear unjust or unreasonable to demonstrate that its rates and charges are just and reasonable. Directs the Commission to: (1) initiate a proceeding examining specified aspects of service and report to the Congress; and (2) unless the Commission finds that market forces are securing rates and charges that are just and reasonable, establish regulations requiring that rates and charges for operator services be just and reasonable."
