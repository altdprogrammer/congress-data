Directs the Secretary, at the same time that the President submits his annual budget request to the Congress, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees and the Comptroller General on the Secretary's assessment of whether the amount specified in the budget for veterans' health care is sufficient for that fiscal year, or, if not, the level needed to sufficiently fund such program. Requires the Comptroller General, no later than 30 days after receiving such report, to report to the same congressional committees on the accuracy of the Secretary's report, together with additional comments as appropriate."
