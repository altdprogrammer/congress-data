    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-04-18", 
    "text": "Competition in Cable Television Act of 1989 - Amends the Clayton Act to provide that no person engaged in the production, creation, or distribution of video programming that is owned or controlled by, or affiliated through substantial common ownership with, any one or more cable systems shall discriminate in the price, terms, conditions, or availability of sale of its programming among cable systems, cable system operators, or other multichannel video programming distributors who purchase such programming for the purpose of delivery to customers. Provides the following exceptions to such prohibition: (1) allows such person to impose reasonable requirements for creditworthiness, service, and financial stability; (2) allows price differentials which are attributable to differences in cost in the creation, sale, delivery, or transmission of such programming; and (3) allows price differentials which are made in good faith to meet the equally low price of a competitor. Makes it unlawful for any cable system operator to acquire an interest in any cable television system where such person owns, controls, or is affiliated through substantial common ownership of, cable systems that are available to more than 25 percent of all cable television subscribers in the United States."
