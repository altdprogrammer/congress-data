    "text": "American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to prohibit the management of Federal lands that have historically been considered sacred and indispensable by a traditional Native American religion and that are necessary for the conduct of a Native American religious practice, in a manner that would threaten such religion or religious practice. Exempts management decisions which are necessary to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Federal Government, protect a compelling governmental interest, or protect a vested property right. Requires Federal agencies making such decisions to attempt to accommodate competing interests and select the course of action that is least intrusive on such religions or religious practices."
