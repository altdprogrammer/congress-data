Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 to change the requirements which must be met before the Secretary of Commerce may close, consolidate, automate, or relocate any Weather Service Office or Weather Service Forecast Office, including requiring a one year notice period and an independent review by the National Academy of Sciences. Subtitle B: Hurricane Reconnaissance Program Findings - Directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce to establish a five-year joint program for collecting operational and reconnaissance data, conducting research, and analyzing data on tropical cyclones to assist the forecast and warning program and increase the understanding of the cause and behavior of tropical cyclones. Sets forth the responsibilities of each Secretary. Directs those Secretaries to jointly develop and submit to the Congress management plans for: (1) the program established by this Act; and (2) continued tropical cyclone surveillance and reconnaissance which will adequately protect the citizens of U.S. coastal areas. Mandates that the management plans and programs required by this Act: (1) provide for at least the same degree and quality of protection as currently exists with a combination of satellite technology and manned flights; and (2) in no way allow any reduction in the level, quality, timeliness, sustainability, or area served of both the existing principal and back-up tropical cyclone reconnaissance and tracking systems. Subtitle C: Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization - Amends the Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984 to mandate that any license issued under specified provisions of that Act specify that the licensee shall promptly make available all unenhanced data which the Secretary of the Interior (currently, the Secretary of Commerce) may request under specified provisions of the Act relating to archiving of data. Amends provisions of the Act relating to archiving in order to transfer from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the Interior responsibility for: (1) providing for long-term storage, maintenance, and upgrading of the basic, global, land remote-sensing data set; (2) requesting data needed for the basic data set from a system operator; (3) making data which is in the public domain available to requesting parties; and (4) using existing Government facilities, to the extent practicable, to carry out these functions. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to consult with the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that archiving activities are consistent with the terms and conditions or any contract, agreement, or license under specified provisions of the Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act. Title II: NOAA Ocean and Coastal Programs - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable NOAA to carry out activities relating to: (1) mapping, charting, and geodesy; (2) observation and assessment; and (3) ocean and Great Lakes research. Subtitle B: Coastal Monitoring - Marine and Coastal Monitoring Act of 1990 - Establishes within NOAA a unified nationwide monitoring network which includes the activities and functions of the National Status and Trends Program of NOAA.

Requires the Administrator of NOAA to carry out monitoring activities in accordance with the guidance and priorities set by an interagency committee of specified composition. Requires the Administrator to: (1) designate specific estuarine and coastal regions of major concern in which the waters shall be intensively monitored; and (2) establish monitoring coordination groups for each designated region. Requires each group to: (1) submit to the Administrator a long term monitoring plan; and (2) annually develop an operating plan. Authorizes the Administrator, upon recommendation by the group, to award supplemental funding for up to 50 percent of a specific monitoring activity. Directs the Administrator to establish within NOAA a National Coastal Monitoring Center to develop scientific methods and procedures for carrying out the monitoring under this subtitle. Title III: Authorization of NOAA Fishery Programs - Amends the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries Program Act to authorize appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable the National Marine Fisheries Service to carry out its duties under law relating to information collection and analysis, conservation and management operations, and State and industry assistance. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable NOAA to construct a National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory adjacent to the National Wetlands Research Center, to be used to support coastal habitat research of the National Marine Fisheries Service laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce to enable NOAA to carry out activities relating to: (1) executive direction and administration; (2) acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operation of facilities; (3) marine services, including ship operations, maintenance, and support; and (4) aircraft services, including aircraft operations, maintenance, and support.
