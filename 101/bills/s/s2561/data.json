    "text": "Precursor Chemical Regulation Act of 1990 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to revise and expand the list of precursor chemicals, including transferring to such list hydriodic acid from the list of essential chemicals. Revises the definition of \"regulated transaction\" to include transfers of any amount of an essential listed precursor chemical, with exceptions. Requires each regulated person to report to the Attorney General on any regulated transaction involving any quantity of a listed essential chemical. Directs the Attorney General to cooperate with State authorities by providing information regarding regulated transaction in such chemicals that might be useful in the administration of State laws relating to precursor chemicals, controlled substances, and other illegal drugs. Makes it unlawful for any person to engage in a regulated transaction involving a listed precursor chemical or to manufacture, distribute, import, or export such a chemical without a license required under such Act. Requires the Attorney General to establish a program requiring licenses for regulated persons and regulated transactions involving listed precursor chemicals where such requirement will contribute to achievement of the purposes of such Act and to criminal drug law enforcement. Provides for fines and imprisonment of not more than four years for violations of the licensing requirement. Requires the Attorney General to provide for the audit and control of listed precursor chemical inventories of persons possessing a license under this Act. Prohibits a person possessing a listed chemical with the intent that it be used in the illegal manufacture of a controlled substance to manage the listed chemical or waste from such manufacture other than as required by regulations issued under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Provides for assessment of costs (of initial cleanup and disposal of the listed chemical and contaminated property and of restoring property damaged by exposure to a listed chemical) and imprisonment for violation of this requirement, in addition to a penalty imposed for the illegal manufacture, possession, or distribution of a listed chemical or waste of an illegal laboratory. Authorizes the Court to order that all or a portion of the earnings from work performed by a defendant in prison be withheld for payment of such costs. Amends the Federal bankruptcy code to provide that a discharge in bankruptcy does not discharge the debtor from any debt for such costs. Authorizes the Attorney General to direct that assets forfeited in connection with a prosecution under such Act be shared with State agencies that participated in the seizure or cleanup of a contaminated site."
