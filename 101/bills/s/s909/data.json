Requires that such evaluation have a public and confidential section and that it place special emphasis on the institution's record of serving the housing needs of low- and moderate-income persons, small business credit needs, and small farm credit needs. Mandates that the confidential section contain statements which, in the judgment of the Federal supervisory agency, are not properly subject to disclosure to the institution or to the public. Prohibits disclosure of the confidential section to the institution or the public unless the supervisory agency determines that such disclosure is in the public interest."
