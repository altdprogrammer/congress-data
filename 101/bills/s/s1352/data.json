Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to carry out a program, to be known as the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan (SSBP), which would enable participants in the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) who are providing coverage for a spouse or former spouse beneficiary under the SBP to also provide a supplemental annuity for that spouse or former spouse beginning when the participant dies or when the spouse or former spouse becomes 62 years of age, whichever is later, in order to offset the effects of the two-tier annuity computation under the SBP.

Authorizes provision of a supplemental spouse annuity under the above provisions by a person who is a participant in the SBP and is providing coverage for a spouse (or spouse and child) but is not a participant in the SSBP, who does not have an eligible spouse under that Plan, and who remarries, thereby allowing such person to elect to provide such coverage for the former spouse.

Requires the amount of the reduction to be adjusted whenever there is an adjustment to the reduction in retired pay for beneficiary coverage under the original SBP. Directs the President to prescribe regulations to implement the SSBP. Revises the annuity computation for the survivors of certain retirement-eligible officers who die while on active duty, making such an officer's retired pay rate the rate of pay applicable at the time of death. Defines those persons eligible for such recomputation. Authorizes an eligible retired or former member of the armed forces to participate in the SBP during an open enrollment period. Allows such person, at the same time, to also elect to participate in the SSBP. Defines as eligible a person who on the day before the first day of the open enrollment period is not a participant in the SBP and is either entitled to retired pay or would be so entitled but for the fact that such member or former member is under 60 years of age (for reserve members or former members). Allows a person who is a participant in the SBP but not at the maximum base amount while providing coverage for a dependent child but not for a spouse or former spouse to: (1) elect to participate in the SBP at a higher amount; or (2) elect to provide an annuity under the SBP for a spouse or former spouse. Authorizes current SBP participants to elect to participate in the SSBP during the open enrollment period. Outlines those persons eligible to make such an election and sets limitations on eligibility for certain SBP participants not affected by the two-tier annuity computation (a computation that differentiates in the annuity amount depending on whether the annuitant has attained the age of 65). Requires any SSBP election to be made in writing, signed by the person making the election, and received by the Secretary concerned before the end of the open enrollment period. Defines the open enrollment period as the one-year period beginning on the effective date of the Military Survivor Benefit Improvement Act of 1989.
