    "text": "National Needs Trust Fund Act of 1990 - Establishes within the Treasury a National Needs Trust Fund, consisting of funds attributable to the peace dividend which shall then be invested in areas most likely to strengthen the competitive position of the United States in the international economy. Makes amounts in the Trust Fund available to support any authorized Federal program in any or all of the following areas: (1) early childhood education or development; (2) elementary, secondary, and higher education; (3) job training, retraining, and conversion from a Cold War to a peacetime economy; (4) basic research and development; (5) communications and transportation infrastructure; (6) health care; and (7) other fundamental investments that Congress determines are necessary to strengthen the U.S. economic and competitive position and future. Requires that Trust Fund expenditures supplement and not supplant (and not be taken into consideration in determining) Federal, State, and local expenditures in such areas. Directs the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate and report biennially to the Congress on the impact of Trust Fund expenditures. Authorizes appropriations."
