Increases from 50 to 100 percent (thus removing) the net income limitations on the use of such depletion allowances. Sets a percentage depletion allowance of 15 percent for the marginal production of domestic crude oil or natural gas by independent producers. Makes the alternative minimum tax preference for percentage depletion inapplicable to such marginal production."
