Permits advance credit payments through income tax withholding. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study and report to the Congress concerning: (1) the need for non-physician primary care providers in targeted rural areas; (2) the effectiveness of the tax credit in increasing the supply of primary care physicians in the targeted areas; and (3) alternative methods of defining rural health manpower shortage areas. Excludes from gross income any payments made on behalf of a taxpayer by the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program."
