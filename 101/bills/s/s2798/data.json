Sets forth the formula for determining the applicable percentage of such gain from 25 percent for five years, up to 100 percent for such stock held for ten years. Establishes a maximum capital gains rate for individuals and corporations with small business stock gain. Revises the definition of a small business corporation. Provides for the treatment of a corporation as a small business corporation if its stock does not exceed $5,000,000 (currently $1,000,000). Adjusts such amount for inflation."
