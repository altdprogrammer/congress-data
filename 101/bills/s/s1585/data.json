    "text": "Solid Waste Compact Act of 1989 - Amends the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to require States to submit to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval solid waste disposal plans. Authorizes States to enter into compacts to provide for the establishment and operation of regional solid waste disposal facilities. Prohibits a compact from restricting the use of such facilities to solid waste generated in the compact region before January 1, 1991, and before the Congress consents to such compact. Requires a compact to provide that every five years after such compact has taken effect, the Congress may withdraw its consent. Directs EPA to: (1) identify alternative management programs for the control of solid waste and publish technical guidance regarding the implementation of such programs; and (2) publish information that a State or compact must provide to EPA, together with requirements for facilities, if such programs are pursued as alternatives to traditional solid waste management."
