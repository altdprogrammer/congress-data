Allows States to provide Medicaid home and community based services to children who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Applies the same income and resource eligibility standards as would apply if such children were hospitalized. Requires States to increase payments for inpatient hospital services delivered to Medicaid-eligible individuals with AIDS by hospitals serving high volumes of AIDS victims. Permits States to provide Medicaid coverage of the premiums charged individuals who are eligible for continued employer group health plan coverage after their loss of employment if such individuals also have the HIV virus and an income that does not exceed 133 percent of the Federal poverty level."
