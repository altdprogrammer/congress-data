    "text": "El Salvador Aid Restrictions Act of 1990 - Prohibits the provision of U.S. military assistance to El Salvador if the El Salvadoran Government: (1) declines to participate in negotiations for a settlement to the armed conflict; or (2) fails to support an active role for the United Nations Secretary General in mediating such settlement. Withholds 50 percent of specified military assistance allocated under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, beginning in FY 1990. Releases such assistance only if: (1) the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) declines to participate in settlement negotiations or refuses to accept the Secretary General's role in such settlement; or (2) the President certifies to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Speaker of the House that such assistance must be released because FMLN actions jeopardize the survival of the constitutional El Salvadoran Government. Prohibits the provision of U.S. assistance to El Salvador if the Government of El Salvador is overthrown or unconstitutionally removed from office. Expresses doubts about the commitment of the El Salvadoran Government to the observance of human rights. Prohibits the provision of assistance to El Salvador unless the President reports to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Speaker of the House that El Salvador is observing human rights and has: (1) made progress in bringing to trial and convicting those responsible for the murders of specified civilians; (2) adopted measures to stop arbitrary house and office searches; (3) permitted foreign religious organizations to carry out their work unimpeded by Government officials or the military; and (4) made efforts to lift the state of emergency."
