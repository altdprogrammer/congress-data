Provides for a Board of Directors appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) certain property transfers from the Department of Energy; and (2) the Corporation's capital structure, pricing policies, and user charges for decommissioning, decontamination, and remedial activities. Requires the Corporation to prepare an annual status report for the President and the Congress. Prescribes licensing and taxation guidelines for the Corporation. Sets guidelines for payments in lieu of taxes by the Corporation to States and local governments. Directs the Board to make recommendations to the President regarding the transfer of its functions and assets to private ownership. Declares that the Corporation's receipts, proceeds, and recoveries (including deposits in the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund) shall be available without fiscal year limitations and without further appropriations. Applies Federal environmental and occupational safety and health law to the Corporation as though it were privately owned. Establishes the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund to cover the Corporation's decommissioning and decontamination expenses."
