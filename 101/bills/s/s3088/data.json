    "text": "Establishes the Kahoolawe Island Conveyance Commission to conduct a study to recommend the terms and conditions for the conveyance of a parcel of land known as Kahoolawe Island, Hawaii, by the United States to the State of Hawaii. Outlines other Commission duties in connection with such conveyance. Requires interim and final reports from the Commission to the Congress. Terminates the Commission 30 days after its final report. Prohibits the land subject to the study from being used for bombing training, gunnery training, or similar munitions delivery training by any military department of the United States, the Coast Guard, or any entity of a foreign government by or with the permission of the United States. Terminates such prohibition 120 days after submission of the Commission's final report. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study of the desirability and feasibility of establishing a national marine sanctuary in the marine environment adjacent to Kahoolawe Island, considering especially the effects such a sanctuary would have on the population of humpback whales that inhabit the marine environment. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the result of the study and any appropriate recommendations. Prohibits any improvements to be made on Kahoolawe Island between enactment of this Act and ending on the date of termination of the Commission unless approved by the Secretary of the Navy or provided in a specified consent decree. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the study of the Commission."
