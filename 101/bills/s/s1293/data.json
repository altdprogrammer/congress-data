    "text": "Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the Act) to apply the prohibition against age discrimination to employee benefits. Allows employers, employment agencies, or labor organizations to observe the terms of a bona fide employee benefits plan where the actual amount of benefit payments made or cost incurred on behalf of an older worker is equal to that for a younger worker, even though the older worker may receive a lesser amount of benefits. Prohibits such a plan from permitting the involuntary retirement of an individual 40 years old or older because of age. Places on the employer, the employment agency, or the labor organization the burden of proving that certain actions are lawful exceptions to prohibitions in any civil enforcement proceeding brought under the Act. Provides that a seniority system or employee benefit plan is not exempt from prohibitions against age discrimination on the basis of its enactment date."
