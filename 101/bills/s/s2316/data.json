Requires the loan rate for sugar beets to be fair and reasonable in relation to the rate for sugarcane. Title II: Regulation of Sugar Imports - Authorizes the President to establish a tariff-rate import quota on sugar structured to maintain the market price for raw sugar at or near the market stabilization price. Sets the total quantity of sugar subject to the lowest rate of duty under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for each fiscal year beginning with FY 1992. Provides a formula for calculating the highest rate of duty. Provides for the allocation of lowest-duty sugar import quotas among foreign countries and for the determination of market stabilization and threshold prices."
