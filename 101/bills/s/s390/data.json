Directs the President to create a Business Incubator Review Group to review Federal activities regarding business incubators and to report to the Congress on programs and recommended changes. Terminates the Group 30 days after submission of its report. Directs Group members to review business development regulations and to take action to assure that business incubators are eligible for grants and loans. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the Clearinghouse for State and Local Initiatives on Productivity, Technology, and Innovation, to study and report to the Congress on business incubators, including State and local programs. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to assign to the Clearinghouse the duty to collect information on Federal programs which support business incubators and assist State and local governments regarding such programs."
