Requires an individual, in order to be eligible for such assistance, to: (1) be accepted or enrolled as a full-time student at a qualifying educational institution in a course of education or training approved by the Secretary and that leads toward completion of a degree in a health profession involving direct patient care or care incident to such direct patient care; (2) be entitled to benefits under the Selected Reserve GI Bill program; and (3) have achieved a certain qualifying score on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Authorizes the Secretary to pay a qualifying individual $400 monthly under such program. Requires a period of obligated service as a full-time employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs from a participating individual in return for such assistance. Makes such an individual liable to the United States for failure to serve in the Department at a health-care facility for the agreed upon period. Increases the Selected Reserve member stipend amount whenever there is a general Federal pay increase."
