Adds cancer of the salivary gland and cancer of the urinary tract to the list of diseases that will be presumed to be service-connected for purposes of such disability compensation. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to compile a list of military activities that are likely to have resulted in exposure to ionizing radiation above background levels. Requires the Secretary, immediately after including an activity on such list, to direct the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards to determine whether an association exists between the maximum level of exposure experienced by an individual and one or more of the diseases listed as presumptively service-connected for purposes of veterans' disability compensation. Requires the Secretary, after receiving a report from the Committee on such activities, to: (1) establish a presumption of service-connection between such activity and any of the diseases listed; or (2) determine that available scientific evidence clearly establishes that there is no reasonable possibility of an association between that disease and participation in that activity."
