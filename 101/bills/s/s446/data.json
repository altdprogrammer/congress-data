    "text": "Price-Anderson Financial Accountability Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Attorney General to initiate a legal suit to recover indemnification payments made by the Federal Government to a contractor for public liability resulting from the contractor's (or subcontractor's or supplier's) gross negligence or willful misconduct. Precludes the Department of Energy from reimbursing such contractor. Denies the contractor eligibility to receive any Federal contract for a five-year period beginning on the date the recovery is awarded. Requires the Secretary of Energy to: (1) define by rule the term \"total contract price\"; and (2) renegotiate indemnification agreements upon contractor request during a specified period."
