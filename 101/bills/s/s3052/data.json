Gives priority to centers: (1) receiving State or political subdivision support not connected to any Federal program; (2) in areas where a trauma center has ceased participation; or (3) which, because of uncompensated costs, will be unable to participate in the trauma care system. Limits support for a center to three years, subject to extension by the Secretary for one additional year. Authorizes appropriations."
