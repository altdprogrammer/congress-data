Provides a legislative settlement to litigation between Kootznoowoo, Inc. and the Secretary over the ownership of the Angoon Administrative Site. Confirms in the United States all rights, title, and interest to land lying within specified boundaries and specified lands within such site adjacent to the mean high tide line of Kootznoowoo Inlet which the Secretary dictates for uses related to administration of the Tongass National Forest. Conveys the remainder of such lands to Kootznoowoo, Inc. by quitclaim deed. Retains an easement for road and utility access. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to deliver to the Congress by a specified deadline a history of specified native villages together with legislative recommendations regarding their eligibility for Native Corporation status under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act."
