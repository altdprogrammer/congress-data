    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-05-18", 
    "text": "Conservation Enhancement and Improvement Act of 1989 - Title I: Erosion Control - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to authorize an additional five-year period of crop base protection for conservation reserve program (CRP) land that continues to be put to conservation use after the expiration of the CRP contract. Extends multiyear conservation contract authority. States that highly erodible set aside land must not erode at rates greater than cropped land on the same farm. Requires that there be no net soil loss with respect to CRP contracts entered into after enactment of this Act. Title II: Wildlife Habitat Improvement - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to authorize multiyear wildlife habitat improvement contracts on a Federal-State cost sharing basis. Provides incentives to producers to use idled acreage for such purposes. Title III: Alternative Agricultural Practices and New Crops - Expresses the sense of the Congress that with respect to new farm legislation, alternative agricultural practices should be explored. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to initiate a program to certify State programs for labeling retail food products as having been naturally grown. Funds such program through fees from participating States. Title IV: Water Protection and Enhancement - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to make critical groundwater contamination areas eligible for the CRP, regardless of such land's erodibility. Establishes a wetland reserve program (WRP) to restore converted wetlands and adjacent areas to their natural state. Sets a minimum amount of 1990 enrolled acreage. Limits: (1) aggregate CRP and WRP acreage; and (2) Federal cost sharing. Amends the Water Bank Act to require waterbank contracts to include permanent wetland easements prohibiting: (1) commodity production (except for authorized haying and grazing); and (2) destruction or alteration of such lands. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to prohibit the use of Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) loans for wetland drainage. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to permit cropland to enter the CRP if crop production on such land would have a direct adverse effect on groundwater. Authorizes minimum impact agricultural use of such land. Directs the Secretary to establish a voluntary well water testing program. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to apply wetland conservation provisions to idled cropland. Title V: Forest Protection and Enhancement - States that it is U.S. policy to maintain current forest levels by balancing forest destruction with forest renewal. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to make shelter-belts and windbreaks eligible for the CRP regardless of such land's erodibility. Requires producers to agree to an easement on the land for the useful life of a shelterbelt or windbreak. Provides CRP hardwood tree planting incentives, including: (1) extended contracts and planting periods; (2) cost sharing and tree maintenance assistance; and (3) waiver of county cropland limitations. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to prohibit the use of FmHA loans for forest clearing, except in cases of tree management or commercial harvesting. Directs the Secretary to upgrade urban forestry research, education, and technical assistance. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary to permit lands which are not highly erodible but which pose an on-farm or off-farm environmental threat to be enrolled in the CRP."
