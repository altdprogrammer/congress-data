Declares it out of order in the Senate, with limited exception, to consider legislation that increases the public debt limit during a fiscal year above the level set forth in the concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal year. Considers this Act and its resultant amendments as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and of the House of Representatives."
