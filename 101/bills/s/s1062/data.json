    "text": "Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 Amendments Act - Amends the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 to add new findings regarding the need for the geological study of faults and the need for earthquake-resistent building practices in private and Federal facilities. Removes earthquake prediction and control findings. Modifies the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and its functions in leading the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Programm (NEHRP). Establishes an interagency committee to coordinate Federal emergency planning activities and an advisory committee to review and advise on the Program's performance. Adds to the Program's objectives: (1) accelerated implementation of State, local, and private programs and research to reduce earthquake hazards; and (2) the performance of basic and applied research in earthquake hazards reduction and innovative approaches to accelerating technology transfer. Adds the Department of Education to the agencies involved in NEHRP activities. Adds to the Program's research requirements an earthquake data base and assessments of earthquake-prone regions. Requires the mitigation elements of the Program to provide for additional factors, including: (1) guidelines for land-use management; (2) identification of social, economic, and legal factors motivating adoption of earthquake hazards mitigation programs; (3) training in emergency planning; and (4) adoption of seismic design and construction standards (to be developed by the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction). Requires public education efforts, regional clearinghouses, and cooperative programs to inform the public on earthquake hazards. Requires acceleration of the development of postulated earthquake planning and response scenarios for various events in risk areas throughout the United States, including expanded use of advanced technologies and development of national emergency response plans which assess the survivability of emergency broadcast capabilities. Establishes a Center for the International Exchange of Earthquake Information, within the U.S. Geological Survey, to: (1) promote information exchange between the United States and other nations; (2) maintain a library of information produced by the Program; and (3) handle foreign requests for information on American earthquake research and preparedness. Establishes an Earthquake Investigations Program to investigate major earthquakes and to draw lessons from such investigations to improve earthquake hazards mitigation programs. Authorizes appropriations."
