    "date": "1990-10-26", 
    "text": "Alaska Land Status Technical Corrections Act of 1990 - Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to: (1) modify the Fort Davis land allotment; and (2) subject such land to valid existing rights and an easement for the Iditarod National Historic Trail. Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to authorize an allotment applicant, who had a valid application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, and whose application remains pending as of the date of the enactment of this Act, to amend the land description to describe land other than that the applicant originally intended to claim if: (1) the applicant filed an allotment application which described land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to the State of Alaska; (2) the amended land description describes land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to Alaska of approximately equal acreage to substitute for the land originally described in the application; and (3) the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources for Alaska, acting under the authority of State law, has agreed to reconvey or relinquish the land described in the amended application to the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) accept conveyance or relinquishment of the land described in the amended application from Alaska as an allotment for the benefit of the allotment application; (2) upon such acceptance, to cause the allotment to be surveyed (if it has not already been surveyed) and issue a trust certificate; and (3) adjust his computation of the acreage charged against Alaska's land entitlement. Ratifies certain conveyances to the Montana Creek and Caswell Native Associations and declares that such Associations have received their full entitlement of lands pursuant to ANCSA. Withdraws specified lands, for a period of one year, for selection by the Elim Native Corporation. Authorizes such Corporation to select such lands in partial satisfaction of its entitlement under ANCSA. Bars selections from lands within the Iditarod National Historic Trail corridor. Requires the Secretary to receive and adjudicate such selections as though they were filed in a timely manner and to convey such lands to such Corporation. Specifies that a real property interest distributed by a Native Corporation to a shareholder of such corporation pursuant to a program to provide homesites to its shareholders shall be deemed conveyed and received under ANCSA, provided that certain conditions are met, including that alienability of the Corporation's Settlement Common Stock has not yet been terminated under provisions of such Act. Directs the Secretary to execute such instruments as necessary to release the condition on specified lands (including Beaver Airport) that such lands revert to the United States if such lands are not developed, or cease to be used, for airport purposes. Modifies the boundary of the Chugach National Forest, Alaska. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to convey specified land in Alaska to the Rabbit Creek Lions Club. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to the University of Alaska all U.S. interests in the lands of the University of Alaska's Agricultural Experiment Station and Fur Farm Experiment Station."
