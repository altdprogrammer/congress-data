    "text": "Chlorofluorocarbons and Halon Reduction Act of 1989 - Declares that the objective of this Act is to provide a smooth transition away from the use of ozone-depleting chemicals in order to protect the earth's ozone layer and limit global warming. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations to: (1) impose ozone-protection charges on producers and importers of specified ozone-depleting chemicals; and (2) add to the list of such chemicals those known or anticipated to contribute to ozone depletion and whose production or importation should be limited to protect public health and the environment. Directs the Administrator to assure that no charge is imposed on chemicals that are used and entirely consumed in the production of other chemicals. Sets forth production charge procedures and assessment periods for specified ozone-depleting chemicals. Permits modification of such procedures as specified. Establishes the Ozone Layer and Climate Protection Trust Fund. Provides that all charge moneys received by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be deposited in such Fund. Makes specified percentages of Fund moneys available to support research related to substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals by chemical producers and alternative products that are produced without such chemicals. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the operation of the Fund. Sets forth investment duties of the Secretary with regard to the Fund. Directs the Administrator to establish an advisory committee in connection with the research to be conducted pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and carry out a grant program for such research. Authorizes appropriations from the Fund for the research grant program."
