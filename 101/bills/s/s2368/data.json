    "text": "National Biological Diversity Conservation and Environmental Research Act of 1990 - States that the global conservation of biological diversity is a national priority. Requires Federal actions to be consistent with such goal. Directs Federal agencies to conduct annual reviews of their programs for consistency with the conservation of biological diversity pursuant to this Act and to report the results of such reviews to the President, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Congress. Sets forth requirements for programs found to be inconsistent with this Act. Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to: (1) establish guidelines for consideration of biological diversity in the preparation of environmental impact statements; and (2) identify those biotic communities, species, and populations that appear to be in decline, in imminent danger of loss of viability, or otherwise of special concern. Requires impacts on biological diversity to be considered in the assessment of impacts of Federal actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Sets forth requirements for the Council on Environmental Quality with respect to the review of agency reviews on biological diversity. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in reviewing environmental impacts under the Clean Air Act, to consider an action to be unsatisfactory if it is likely to result in a significant reduction of biological diversity. Establishes within the Smithsonian Institution a National Center for Biological Diversity and Conservation Research (Center) responsible for: (1) coordinating the collection of data pertaining to the national biota and supplementing and disseminating such information; (2) arranging and conducting surveys and supplementary research of the national biota; and (3) enhancing the application of biological data to the conservation of biological diversity. Establishes an Interagency Working Committee on Biological Diversity responsible for preparing a coordinated Federal strategy (Strategy) for conservation of biological diversity. Requires specified entities to designate representatives to work with the Committee to ensure the coordination of the Strategy with the existing U.S. strategy on international biological diversity and with related international treaty obligations. Dissolves the Committee after the submission of Federal and regional strategies for biological diversity. Sets forth required contents of the Strategy. Requires the Committee to delineate large ecological regions within the United States and to prepare a biological diversity strategy for such regions. Authorizes each agency represented on the Committee to provide grants to public agencies, private individuals, and organizations for projects to maintain or restore biological diversity. Directs each entity represented on the Committee to: (1) give high priority to research and personnel training directed towards implementation of the Strategy; and (2) assess the adequacy of its environmental research and training programs. Requires the National Science Foundation to support research that integrates fundamental and applied science toward conservation of biological diversity. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) research the potential of increased utilization of biological diversity in agriculture; (2) undertake long studies of agroecosystems; and (3) assess the impact of agricultural and forestry practices on biological diversity and recommend improvements, as appropriate. Establishes, as a permanent entity, a National Scientific Advisory Committee on Biological Diversity which shall: (1) oversee the implementation and coordination of the Strategy; (2) assist in the evaluation of the impacts of proposed Federal activities on biological diversity; (3) assist in the review of Federal programs for consistency with the conservation of biological diversity and the adequacy of such programs in environmental research and training; and (4) serve as a general reference and advisory resource for the Nation in matters relating to conservation of biological diversity. Directs specified Federal agencies to encourage conservation of biological diversity through: (1) supporting and coordinating global conservation of biological diversity programs; (2) supporting research for, and increasing training, education, and technical assistance related to, sustainable development and international conservation of biological diversity; and (3) cooperating with each other and international organizations to carry out such activities. Requires the Agency for International Development (AID) to hire U.S. environmental and natural resources staff with training in conservation of biological diversity and sustainable development. Reaffirms congressional support for provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 which address tropical deforestation and loss of biological diversity. Directs AID to give high priority to the implementation of such provisions. Authorizes appropriations."
