Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the Band Tax Fund and to use it to pay certain claims for which the Band is liable and which have been certified by the Maine Commissioner of Finance as valid claims. Provides that if there are insufficient funds in the Band Tax Fund to pay all claims in full, the deficiency shall be paid only from income-producing property owned by the Band which is not held in trust by the United States. Directs the Secretary to prescribe procedures governing the filing and payment of such claims. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to expend funds in the Land Acquisition Fund to acquire land or natural resources for the Band. Declares that land or natural resources acquired in Maine with such funds shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Band. Extends Federal recognition to the Aroostook Band of Micmacs. Makes the Band eligible to receive financial benefits available to other federally recognized tribes and eligible for special programs and services regardless of the residence of the members of the Band on or near a reservation. Declares that the Band and its lands shall have the same status as other tribes and their lands accorded Federal recognition under the terms of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980. Authorizes Maine and the Band to execute agreements regarding State jurisdiction over lands owned by, or held in trust for the benefit of, the Band or any member of the Band. Allows the Band to organize for its common welfare and to adopt an appropriate governing document, consistent with the terms of this Act, to be filed with the Secretary. Provides for the classification of the Band as an Indian tribe within the meaning of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 for transfer to the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Land Acquisition Fund."
