    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-04-20", 
    "text": "Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 1990 - Title I: Educational Assistance and Vocational Rehabilitation Program Improvements - Eliminates the reference to a high school equivalency certificate (as a requirement for eligibility for educational benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill), instead requiring that an individual have certain alternate school credentials accepted by the armed forces, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Defense, which are equivalent to a secondary school diploma. Makes persons receiving outpatient medical care or services pending discharge from active military service eligible for veterans' vocational rehabilitation if such persons are being treated at a hospital under contract or agreement with the Secretary of Defense. Extends by one year the period of automatic disenrollment for veterans' educational assistance benefits to allow for the filing of a claim for such benefits. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into an agreement with an individual whereby the individual agrees to perform work-study service and the Secretary deducts the allowance otherwise payable to such individual from indebtedness resulting from any overpayment received by such individual under Department of Veterans Affairs-administered education, rehabilitation, or training benefits. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to reduce or eliminate such individual's indebtedness, to waive certain work-study program eligibility requirements and limitations, as well as certain debt collection requirements. Prohibits such an agreement from continuing in force after the individual's debt has been liquidated. Requires the Secretary to compensate such an individual for work-study services performed after such debt had been liquidated. Title II: Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires an honorable discharge from active duty as an eligibility condition for veterans' basic educational assistance for individuals placed on the retired list, transferred to the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, or placed on the temporary disability retired list. Eliminates the authority of the Secretary to make advance payment of the rehabilitation subsistence allowance. Eliminates the required advance payment of the portion of the work-study allowance payable to an individual participating in the veteran-student services program. Eliminates educational assistance for persons enlisting for active duty in the armed forces as an education program for which expenses incurred by a State approving agency will be reimbursed by the Department of Veterans Affairs."
