    "text": "Title I: Peace Corps Act Amendments of 1990 - Peace Corps Act Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Peace Corps Act to: (1) extend authorizations of appropriations for the Peace Corps through FY 1992; (2) shorten the period during which a former Foreign Service-appointed Peace Corps employee is ineligible for reemployment by the Peace Corps; and (3) establish the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account to pay expenses for Peace Corps operations which exceed appropriations for such expenses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Authorizes appropriations for such Account. Permits former Peace Corps employees (who later become Federal employees) to contribute specified percentages of readjustment allowances received for Peace Corps service to their employing agencies in order to retain credit for such service in the computation of Federal retirement benefits. Reduces civil service retirement benefits for former Peace Corps volunteers who receive social security benefits and whose entitlement to an annuity is based on a separation from Federal service before this Act's enactment date. Title II: Index of Economic Freedom Act of 1990 - Index of Economic Freedom Act of 1990 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to direct the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to develop a system for evaluating the economic freedom and opportunities of individuals in countries eligible for development assistance. Designates such system as the Index of Economic Freedom. Requires the Index to assign a numerical rating for property rights, business regulations, informal sector, wage and price controls, taxation, trade policy, restrictions on investment and capital flows, size of state sector, and banking based on the degree to which each such factor reflects the degree of economic freedom and opportunity in a country. Directs the Administrator to apply the Index to eligible countries and to report to the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the findings of such evaluation. Prohibits certain assistance from being provided to a country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 unless the Index data on such country has been considered. Requires the Administrator to use the Index to: (1) promote improvements in the underlying economic conditions evaluated by the Index while retaining flexibility in implementing development programs; and (2) evaluate the direction of policy changes in less developed countries."
