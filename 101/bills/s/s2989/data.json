Requires Medicaid coverage of children who have attained age six but who have not attained age 19 and whose family income does not exceed 200 percent of the Federal poverty level if such children are not otherwise covered under the Medicaid program or under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) or part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act. Provides Federal coverage for all of the costs of such coverage. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the excise tax on cigarettes. Establishes the Medicaid Expansion Trust Fund into which cigarette tax revenues shall be placed to finance this Act's expansion of Medicaid eligibility. Eliminates the cigarette tax increase at the close of FY 1993."
