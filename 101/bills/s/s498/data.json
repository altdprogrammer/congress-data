    "text": "Teachers' Professional Development Act - Authorizes appropriations for the following programs established by this Act: (1) teaching professions pilot grants, for FY 1990 through 1992; (2) teacher recruitment incentive grants, for FY 1990 through 1996; (3) inservice teacher training grants, for FY 1990 through 1996; (4) the National Academy for Teaching, for FY 1990 through 1996; (5) a study of school teacher and administrator pension portability; and (6) student loan forgiveness for teachers in public schools with substantial enrollments of minority students, for FY 1990 through 1996. Establishes the teaching professions pilot grants program. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants, on a competitive basis, to local educational agencies (LEAs) to plan and implement pilot programs to enhance the professional status, governance role, and professional satisfaction of teachers. Limits grants to a maximum of three years. Establishes the teacher recruitment incentive grants program. Directs the Secretary to make program grants, on a competitive basis, to: (1) eligible LEAs for local recruitment programs; and (2) eligible LEAs (or LEA consortia) and institutions of higher education, applying jointly, for teacher preparation programs. Requires local recruitment program grants to be used for either: (1) educational support for teacher aides to assist them in higher education leading to teacher certification; or (2) pilot programs to encourage secondary school students (especially minority students) to pursue teaching careers. Requires that joint teacher preparation programs grants be used for five-year cooperative programs of teacher training, with four years of student preparation for a teaching certificate and a fifth year of participation in a jointly operated teacher training program. Establishes the inservice teacher training grants program. Directs the Secretary to make grants to LEAs to plan and implement such programs in mathematics, science, foreign languages, technology, the humanities, and pedagogical skills. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Academy for Teaching, through grants, contracts, or other arrangements with a public agency or private nonprofit institution or organization. Requires the Academy to: (1) serve as a clearinghouse for research, evaluations, and model programs regarding professional development, recruitment, and training of teachers; (2) disseminate information about such research, evaluations, and model programs; and (3) train and retrain elementary or secondary school teachers and principals. Directs the Secretary to conduct a pension portability study of the feasibility of permitting teachers and administrators to transport pension benefits among States and LEAs. Provides for student loan forgiveness for teachers in public schools with substantial enrollments of minority students. Directs the Secretary to cancel the obligation to repay a Stafford loan (a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965) for any borrower who is employed in a public elementary or secondary school of a State educational agency or LEA in which minority students enrollment is 50 percent or more of the total enrollment of such school. Directs the Secretary to cancel the obligation to repay 20 percent of the total amount of each such loan for each year in which the borrower is a full-time teacher in such a school, and to cancel the entire amount of interest for each year in which a portion of the loan is cancelled. Directs the Secretary to repay each eligible holder and lender of such loans from appropriations authorized under this Act."
