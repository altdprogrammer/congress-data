Makes such offense punishable by a fine and up to five years in prison. Sets forth parallel provisions with respect to recklessly transmitting a destructive computer program or code. Makes such offense a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine and imprisonment for up to one year. Creates a civil cause of action for compensatory or injunctive relief for persons suffering damage or loss by virtue of a violation of this Act. Limits damages to economic damages, except for medical records violations. Sets a statute of limitations of two years from the date of the act complained of, or from the date of discovery of the damage. Requires the Attorney General to report to the Congress annually during the first three years following the date of enactment of this Act concerning prosecutions under this Act. Repeals provisions which exclude automated typewriters and typesetters, portable hand held calculators, and similar devices from the definition of \"computer.\" Modifies the prohibition against accessing a Government computer where such conduct affects the use of the Government's operation of such computer to cover only actions that \"adversely\" affect such use."
