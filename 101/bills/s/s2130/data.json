    "text": "Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to repeal an exemption from specified communicable disease control requirements of the Public Health Service Act for waste disposal from railroads operating in intercity rail passenger service. Prohibits the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) from discharging waste from its trains except at servicing areas approved by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Authorizes Amtrak to impose a service charge on its passengers to cover costs incurred by it in complying with this Act. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations prohibiting the discharge of waste from trains while such trains are: (1) traveling in an urban area; (2) outside of an urban area and traveling at a speed under 35 miles per hour; and (3) within a passenger or freight facility. Sets forth civil penalties."
