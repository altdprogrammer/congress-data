    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-01-25", 
    "text": "Global Environment and Climate Change Assessment Act of 1989 - Establishes the Task Force for Research and Assessment of the Changing Environment to carry out a ten-year interagency program. Provides that the Task Force shall be administered by a Director within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Directs the Task Force to prepare a research plan to serve as the guide for the ten-year program and provide an accurate understanding of: (1) the causes and effects of global environmental and climate change; (2) the probability that such change will occur; and (3) the information necessary to make judgments about how to respond to such changes. Sets forth deadlines for the submission of such plan to the Congress and the period for public review. Requires the research plan to include programs to: (1) assure the operation of a long-term monitoring network to measure parameters of the atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere; (2) research and analyze all possible causes for any observed or predicted changes in global climate; (3) make predictions regarding the degree to which such change may occur and what the effects may be on industry, agriculture, transportation, and patterns of human behavior and habitation; (4) identify the regions likely to be affected by such changes and investigate the feasibility, probable outcome, and economic costs of technologies that can be used to prevent or reduce such changes; (5) cooperate with research being conducted by sovereign nations and international organizations on such changes; and (6) analyze available information to present periodic assessments about actions to be taken to alleviate such changes and their effects. Requires the Director to: (1) obtain from agencies that are members of the Task Force a description of all programs being undertaken or planned relating to global climate research; and (2) certify whether or not such programs are part of the Task Force's research and assessment effort. Requires the research plan to: (1) describe the form in which the Task Force will present its findings; and (2) provide the National Science Foundation with organizational, management, and oversight authority over a global climate change research program. Requires the research plan to be implemented in the nine fiscal years following the year such plan is issued in final form. Requires the Task Force: (1) no later than two years after the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for the next seven years, to report to the Congress on the research activities and findings of the previous year; and (2) no later than nine years after the enactment of this Act, to publish a research report compiling all findings for the life of the program. Directs the Task Force to publish three major assessment documents no later than two, five, and ten years after the enactment of this Act. Requires the Task Force, to the degree that such assessments are compatible with the existing international investigation into global climate changes, to convene an international conference to study the findings of such assessments. Requests the National Academy of Sciences to convene a Scientific Advisory Committee to oversee the work of the Task Force. Authorizes appropriations."
