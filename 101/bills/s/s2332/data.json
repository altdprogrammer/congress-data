    "text": "Conservation and Wetlands Enhancement Act of 1990 - Title I: Conservation Reserve Program - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend authority for the conservation reserve program (CRP) through 1995. Expands CRP eligibility to include specified lands associated with groundwater protection. Authorizes CRP contract extensions. Increases CRP cost-sharing for trees to 75 percent. Prohibits an owner of former CRP land from receiving agricultural program benefits for crops grown on such land unless the cultivation is in accordance with an approved conservation plan. Extends the cropland base and allotment history for former CRP land that is not cropped but maintains a cover crop. Title II: Wetlands - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish for 1991 through 1995 a wetlands reserve program of up to 5,000,000 acres to enhance water resources and wildlife habitats. Enrolls eligible land (identified wetland, converted wetland, cropped wetland, or CRP-enrolled wetland) through long-term and permanent easements. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a wetlands restoration program to place specified converted wetland or upland buffer areas into the wetlands reserve program. Authorizes 50 percent cost-sharing assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to exempt from agricultural benefits loss: (1) wetlands that have been cropped for six years in the period 1981 through 1990; or (2) converted wetlands if mitigated by restored wetlands of equal value. Permits resumption of benefits upon the restoration of converted wetland to its original state, as determined by the Secretary and the Department of Interior."
