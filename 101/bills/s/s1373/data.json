Authorizes either a State or the Attorney General to institute a civil action in Federal district court to prevent the drainage of hydrocarbon resources: (1) of the United States by a State or State permittee, or (2) of the State by the United States or a Federal permittee. Mandates that the court provide temporary injunctive relief if the Secretary and the State do not agree upon a cooperative development method for the common hydrocarbon-bearing area. Authorizes appropriations to compensate the State of Louisiana for the net drainage of oil and gas resources as determined in a specified Third Party Factfinder Study."
