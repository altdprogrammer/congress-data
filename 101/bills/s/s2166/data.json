Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to declare that an unlawful employment practice occurs when a seniority system is adopted, an individual becomes subject to it, or a person is injured by the application of the system or a provision thereof, if it was adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose, whether or not that discriminatory purpose is apparent on the face of the provision."
