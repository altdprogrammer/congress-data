    "date": "1989-02-02", 
    "text": "Federal Election Reform Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit multicandidate political committees from making contributions to: (1) any candidate and the candidate's political committee; (2) a political committee maintained by a national political party; or (3) any other political committee. Sets forth disclosure requirements for independent expenditures through broadcast communications on any radio or television station. Provides that an expenditure is not an independent expenditure where the person making an expenditure is in coordination, consultation, or concert with a candidate. Requires that contributions made by a person, directly or indirectly, to or on behalf of a candidate through an intermediary or conduit shall be treated as contributions from the intermediary or conduit, if: (1) the contributions are in the form of a negotiable instrument made payable to the intermediary or conduit rather than the intended recipient; or (2) the intermediary or conduit is a political committee, including any agent thereof, other than a candidate's authorized committee. Directs any person or political committee which collects contributions and makes combined contributions to a candidate or agent thereof to require the contributors to make any checks or money orders payable to a specified payee. Requires a candidate, within 15 days of qualifying for a primary election ballot, to file with the Commission and each other qualifying candidate a declaration stating whether or not such candidate intends to expend funds and incur personal loans for the primary and general election in the aggregate of $250,000 or more from the following sources: (1) personal funds; (2) family funds; and (3) personal loans incurred in connection with the campaign for office. Allows the opponents of such candidate to accept larger contribution amounts from individuals. Requires a candidate who files a declaration of intent not to expend more than $250,000 and who subsequently does exceed such amount, to file an amended declaration within 24 hours after exceeding such amount. Allows a candidate to repay a personal loan in connection with the candidate's campaign from contributions made to such candidate or any authorized committee of such candidate. Prohibits the repayment of any interest on the principal amount of such loan. Prohibits a candidate from making expenditures from personal funds, family funds, or from incurring personal loans in connection with the election campaign at any time within 60 days before such election. Prohibits a candidate who makes expenditures from his personal funds or those of his immediate family to his campaign committee, or makes a loan from such funds to such committee, from using post-election contributions made by any other person to repay any such expenditure or loan. Requires corporations and labor organizations to report to the Federal Election Commission (Commission) payments or services they furnish which are directly attributable to a registration or get-out-the-vote campaign if the aggregate of such payments and the fair market value of such services exceed $2,000 for any election. Deletes the exception to the reporting requirement for communication costs incurred by a membership organization (including a labor organization) or by a corporation primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate. Expands the definition of the term \"national committee\" to include the Democratic and Republican National Committees as well as their respective House and Senate campaign committees. Requires a national committee to report: (1) all contributions, loans, transfers, and other receipts from any source to the committee; (2) the identification of each person who provides such contribution in excess of $200 within the calendar year; and (3) all disbursements made by the committee."
