    "text": "SSI Independence Act for Elderly and Disabled Americans - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to exclude from an SSI recipient's income in SSI eligibility and benefit determinations, contributions of clothing and other contributions, other than cash paid directly to the recipient, which are for the purchase of social services, vocational rehabilitation services, medical care, transportation, educational services, personal assistance or attendant care services, and certain services or equipment related to the quality and livability of his or her shelter. Excludes a trust created for an SSI recipient's benefit from such recipient's resources if such recipient does not have access to the trust's assets. Excludes funds or property placed in a trust for an SSI recipient's benefit from such recipient's income. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide notices and pamphlets to SSI applicants and recipients informing them of the consequences various actions affecting their income and resources will have on their SSI and Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) eligibility. Deems SSI applicants who lost disability benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act after their trial work period to have received SSI benefits while still eligible for OASDI disability benefits and therefore qualify for participation in the SSI work incentive program (providing Medicaid and special SSI cash benefits to disabled individuals whose earnings otherwise make them ineligible for SSI and Medicaid benefits) if they meet SSI income, resource, and disability tests. Provides that reviews to determine the continuing disability of participants in the SSI work incentive program need to be conducted no more frequently than once every 12 months. Excludes spousal income in determining a disabled and working individual's eligibility for participation in the SSI work incentive program. Precludes the attainment of age 65 from serving as a basis for the termination of Medicaid eligibility under the SSI work incentive program. Requires that State supplementary cash payments to the needy include participants in the SSI work incentive program. Excludes impairment-related work expenses from the income of an individual who is eligible for SSI and OASDI disability benefits but receives only State supplementary payments. Treats royalties from the publication of an individual's work and scholarships which have not been used for education expenses as earned income."
