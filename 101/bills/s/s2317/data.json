Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for the collection of such reports and to publish an annual summary. Requires each State reporting under this Act to: (1) ensure that no State law enforcement agency establishes a policy which requires a waiting period before accepting a missing child report; (2) provide that all information is entered into the State law enforcement system and the NCIC computer networks and forwarded to the Missing Children Information Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse) or other designated agency within the State; (3) require the Clearinghouse or designated agency to notify all other law enforcement agencies in the State, verify and update the original entry made into the State law enforcement system and NCIC computer networks, and institute or assist with appropriate search and investigative procedures; and (4) maintain close liaison with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for the exchange of information and technical assistance in the missing children cases. Specifies that any State not complying with such reporting requirements shall be denied grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance authorized by the Missing Children's Assistance Act."
