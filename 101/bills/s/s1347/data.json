Allows the President to waive certain requirements with regard to the leasing of defense articles only during FY 1990 (currently, FY 1989).

Authorizes the President to provide assistance on such terms as determined necessary to carry out this Act. Links assistance to progress by the Government of the Philippines in implementing its economic, structural, and administrative reform program and provides that such assistance may include programs to stimulate and strengthen private sector growth, including voluntary debt reduction, greater U.S. participation in such sector, and sustained economic growth.
