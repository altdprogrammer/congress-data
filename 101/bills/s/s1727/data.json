    "text": "Comprehensive Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1989 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to eliminate the exception permitting the organization of political committees connected to corporations, labor unions, and trade associations. Reduces to $2,500 from $5,000 the aggregate amount that a multicandidate political committee may contribute to any candidate and his authorized political committees with respect to any election for Federal office. Prohibits such a committee from making contributions in excess of specified amounts to any other political committee, excluding such a committee established and maintained by a national political party. Makes it unlawful for any national bank, corporation, or labor organization organized by authority of any law of the Congress to make contributions or expenditures for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to any political committee. Specifies that all contributions made to any political committee which is established, financed, maintained, or controlled by any candidate or Federal officeholder shall be deemed to be a contribution to such individual. Prohibits a conduit or intermediary from delivering or arranging to have delivered contributions from more than two persons who are employees of the same employer or members of the same labor organization. States that employees cannot be obligated to pay for the political activities of the labor organization through membership dues or any other mandatory payment. Allows pro rata dues reductions based on the union's political spending. Increases the amount that a national, State, or local committee of a political party may contribute through coordinated expenditures. Authorizes amounts received as contributions by a candidate's political committee that are in excess of the amount necessary to defray the expenditures incurred by such committee to be transferred without limitation to any national, State, or local committee of any political party or to be refunded to contributors on a pro rata basis. Transfers any undisposed surpluses for application to the National Debt Retirement Account. Makes it unlawful for any political committee or its agent to utilize or dispose of surplus campaign funds except as specified or for any person to accept or receive surplus campaign funds for purposes other than those specified. Requires all dispositions of surplus campaign funds to be reported through an itemization of such expenditures on the post-election semiannual report. Repeals the three-year statute of limitations for violations of the Act (restoring it to five years). Allows the Federal Election Commission to make information contained in compliance files available to the Attorney General, at his request, in connection with an investigation or trial. Bans the use of the congressional frank for unsolicited mass mailings. Requires the Senate Select Committee on Ethics and the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards to prescribe rules governing franked mail, including an allocation for each Member from the amount appropriated for official mail based on the population of the State represented. Charges Members for postage in excess of the allocation. Requires the Sergeant at Arms and the Doorkeeper of the Senate to send: (1) quarterly statements of the cost of postage, paper, and operating expenses incurred as a result of mass mailings processed to each Senator, including the total cost per capita in the State; and (2) a compilation of all such statements to the Committee on Rules and Administration. Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to the House of Representatives. Requires the Federal Election Commission to issue final regulations providing for a uniform method of allocating the costs for any mixed activity between Federal and non-Federal accounts. Revises provisions with respect to congressional reapportionment and redistricting so that the number of persons in congressional districts within each State shall be as nearly equal as practicable, as determined under the most recent decennial census. Prohibits congressional districts from being established with the intent and effect of diluting the voting strength of any persons or members of any political party. Requires district boundaries to avoid the division of counties and minimize the division of cities and other political subdivisions. Establishes expedited Federal judicial review procedures of the redistricting process, giving Federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction."
