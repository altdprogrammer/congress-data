    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to replace provisions relating to community mental health services for the homeless with provisions to be cited as the Projects to Aid the Transition from Homelessness (PATH) Act of 1990. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to make an allotment each fiscal year to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and States in the same manner (but with specified different percentages) as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development makes allocations under specified provisions of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCDA). Provides for allotments to Territories. Requires, subject to waiver, matching non-Federal contributions, with funds received under specified provisions of the HCDA allowed to be included. Requires submission of a description of the intended use of the grant funds. Requires the intended use to be consistent with, and included in, the State comprehensive mental health services plan required under current law. Requires an entity receiving an allotment to use the allotment for grants to or contracts with service providers to provide services and housing to homeless individuals, with at least two-thirds of the allotment used for homeless individuals who have: (1) a primary diagnosis of serious mental illness; or (2) a diagnosis involving serious mental illness and substance abuse. Requires, subject to waiver, that one-third of the allotment go to services, one-third to housing, and one-third to services or housing, all for eligible homeless individuals. Prohibits a grant to a service provider which has a policy of excluding individuals from: (1) mental health services because of substance abuse; or (2) substance abuse services because of mental illness. Specifies the uses of grant funds for services and housing. Prohibits placing homeless individuals in housing in which more than 20 percent of the units are occupied by homeless individuals. Allows grant funds to be used to purchase housing only if at least 50 percent of the purchase price is from non-Federal sources. Prohibits using funds for emergency shelters, construction of housing, inpatient psychiatric or substance abuse treatment, or cash payments to recipients of services. Authorizes appropriations."
