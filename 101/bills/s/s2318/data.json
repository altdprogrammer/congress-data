    "text": "Hazardous Materials Safe Transportation Act of 1990 - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to require persons who transport or cause to be transported in commerce hazardous materials or who manufacture containers for use in the transportation of such materials to submit a registration statement annually to the Secretary of Transportation. (Current law requires such a statement at the Secretary's discretion, and then only once every two years.) Directs the Secretary to require such persons to pay an annual registration fee. Declares that nothing in this Act shall prohibit a State from imposing a similar fee in connection with registration requirements it imposes. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations enabling States to perform flow surveys and to receive routing information from carriers transporting hazardous materials to determine local transportation patterns and target emergency response training allocations. Requires the Secretary to designate routes on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways on which hazardous materials may be transported. Authorizes States to designate alternative preferred routes. Directs the Secretary to compile a list of hazardous materials which pose an immediate threat in the event of an accident. Entitles States to enforce their laws relating to the transportation of hazardous materials by railroads. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with States with respect to cooperative enforcement of Federal and State laws relating to such transportation. Requires the Secretary to encourage uniformity among the States in the establishment and enforcement of penalties for violations of hazardous materials transportation laws. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations requiring any generator of a shipment of hazardous materials to transmit a manifest to a central reporting system and data center. Requires the Secretary to establish and maintain, or contract with a private entity to establish and maintain, a central reporting system and data center to provide law enforcement and firefighting personnel with technical information relating to the transportation of hazardous materials. Authorizes appropriations. Increases the penalties for violations of hazardous materials transportation laws."
