Earmarks specified funds for the cleanup of uncontrolled hazardous waste contamination affecting the sale of a parcel of real property at Hamilton Air Force Base, California. Directs the Secretary to design a comprehensive strategy to involve military and civilian employees of DOD in partnership programs (cooperative efforts between the military and an educational institution to enhance the education of students) with elementary and secondary schools. Prevents a specified amount of funds appropriated to the U.S. Naval Academy from being obligated or expended until the Secretary of the Navy has reported to the defense committees on certain corrective measures with respect to administration, ethics, and intercollegiate sports at the Academy. Prohibits FY 1991 DOD funds from being obligated for research, development, test, and evaluation for the Air Force's space surveillance technology program and for the Navy's program addressing such program. Directs DOD to provide operation and maintenance expenses for the southwest border land-based aerostat drug surveillance program. Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to certain limitations desired to be placed on the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) Program. States that SDI should not focus on the deployment of a space-based kinetic energy weapon system, but instead on a defense system that: (1) would protect against an accidental missile launch against the United States or a limited missile attack by a third-world country; and (2) if deployed, would not be in violation of the 1972 ABM Treaty. States that SDI should continue support for those critical technology efforts that have both civil and military applications in areas other than ballistic missile defense systems. Limits the FY 1991 spending permitted on certain offensive-oriented SDI programs. Requires the Secretary to include a description of program activities for such SDI programs in annual budget justification material submitted to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to report to the defense committees on the allocation of funds appropriated for SDI for FY 1991. Directs the Secretary to provide the Congress with quarterly reports accounting for the contributions made by other countries to Operation Desert Shield, to operations in support of the U.N. embargo against Iraq, and to other operations and efforts to counter Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf region. Requires such reports until U.S. forces are withdrawn. Prohibits funds appropriated by this Act from being used to support an end-strength level in excess of 50,000 for all members of U.S. forces assigned to permanent duty in Japan. Requires such troop strength level to be reached by 10,000 each fiscal year after FY 1991. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) a declaration of war by the Congress or an armed attack on Japan authorizes the President to obligate or expend funds and troops necessary to assist in the defense of Japan; and (2) the President may waive the end-strength limitations for any fiscal year in the national interest if he informs the Congress of such waiver and the reasons therefor. Authorizes the Department of the Army to use a specified amount of Army labor, supplies, and equipment to assist the Department of the Interior in replacing an earth dam in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Prohibits presidential certification of such export until the Congress has received such documentation. Makes available a specified amount of Army Operation and Maintenance funds for the environmental protection program at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Limits the use of funds appropriated by this Act for maintaining more than a specified number of U.S. military personnel assigned to permanent duty in NATO member countries in Europe. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) in the event of a declaration of war by the Congress or a declaration of emergency the President is authorized to obligate funds necessary to prosecute such war or resolve such emergency; and (2) amounts obligated to be reimbursed by a NATO country and certain other amounts provided should not be considered amounts obligated in violation of such limitations. Expresses the sense of the Senate that U.S. participation in a multilateral anti-narcotics strike force should include the full range of appropriate law enforcement and anti-drug abuse agencies. Provides that funds made available to DOD for drug interdiction activities should be expended to fund such U.S. participation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should negotiate with the Group of Seven (the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the European Community) to conclude agreements providing for a balanced international economic burden sharing of common security objectives.
