    "text": "Homelessness Prevention and Community Revitalization Act of 1990 - Title I: Family Support Centers - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to eligible agencies (as defined in this Act) for comprehensive supportive services for low-income families, especially very low-income families living in subsidized housing who were previously homeless or who are at risk of becoming homeless. Directs the Secretary to ensure that an equitable number of grants are awarded to agencies in rural areas. Requires a participating agency to: (1) establish at least one primary location family support center; and (2) employ family case managers. Authorizes planning grants. Provides for annual evaluations of programs receiving assistance under this title. Title II: Provision of Services to Elderly Individuals and Individuals With Chronic and Debilitating Illnesses and Conditions - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to eligible agencies for health and related services for low-income elderly or low-income seriously ill persons, especially very low income elderly or seriously ill persons who were homeless or who are at risk of becoming homeless or institutionalized. Requires a participating agency to establish at least one primary location home health service program. Directs the Secretary to ensure that an equitable number of grants are awarded to agencies in rural areas. Provides for annual evaluations of programs receiving assistance under this title. Authorizes planning grants. Title III: Projects to Aid the Transition From Homelessness - Amends the Public Health Service Act to replace provisions relating to community mental health services for the homeless with provisions to be cited as the Projects to Aid the Transition from Homelessness (PATH) Act of 1990. Directs the Secretary to make an allotment each fiscal year to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and States in the same manner (but with specified different percentages) as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development makes allocations under specified provisions of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCDA). Provides for allotments to territories. Requires, subject to waiver, matching non-Federal contributions, with funds received under specified provisions of the HCDA and the value of any property, buildings, or housing received to be included. Requires submission of a description of the intended use of the grant funds. Requires the intended use to be consistent with, and included in, the State comprehensive mental health services plan required under current law. Requires an entity receiving an allotment to use the allotment for grants to or contracts with service providers to provide services and housing assistance to homeless individuals, with at least two-thirds of the allotment used for homeless individuals who have: (1) a primary diagnosis of serious mental illness; or (2) a diagnosis involving serious mental illness and substance abuse. Directs such entities to give special consideration to the provision of services to homeless veterans and priority to service providers with a demonstrated effectiveness in serving such veterans. Prohibits a grant to a service provider which has a policy of excluding individuals from: (1) mental health services because of substance abuse; or (2) substance abuse services because of mental illness. Specifies the uses of grant funds for services and housing. Prohibits using funds for emergency shelters, construction of housing, inpatient psychiatric or substance abuse treatment, or cash payments to recipients of services. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Community Development Corporation Improvement Grants - Amends the Community Economic Development Act of 1981 to direct the Secretary to make grants for community development corporation: (1) business management enhancement; (2) operations; and (3) equity accounts for low-income housing development. Requires the Secretary to ensure that an equitable number of grants are awarded to agencies in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Public Housing Gateway - Public Housing Gateway Act of 1990 - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make gateway program grants to public housing agencies to use public housing in the provision of employment training and services to economically disadvantaged public housing residents who are not more than 25 years of age. Requires public housing agencies to make the following training and services available to eligible individuals through the gateway program they must establish when they receive such a grant: (1) information on training, education, or services offered by the agency; (2) literacy training and bilingual training; (3) remedial education and training in basic skills; (4) development of work habits and other personal management skills; and (5) free child care to facilitate participation in training and other services. Specifies additional training and services which may be offered to eligible individuals who are qualified through literacy training, training in basic and employment skills, and support services. Requires participants in gateway program training and services to be: (1) residents of public housing; (2) not more than 25 years of age; (3) economically disadvantaged; and (4) educationally disadvantaged. Limits mandatory child care services to: (1) participants in gateway program training or services during participation; (2) unemployed former participants who have successfully completed the program, for a specified period; and (3) employed former participants who have successfully completed the program, for a specified period. Permits support services to continue for up to 18 months to any individual after termination of participation in program training or services only if the individual has completed the training or services. Requires public housing agencies receiving such grants to attempt to employ in the gateway programs qualified residents of the public housing project involved. Prohibits consideration of earnings of and benefits to any individual resulting from participation in gateway training and services as income for public assistance or rent limitation purposes during specified periods of participation or post-participation employment. Provides that the use of the facilities of a recipient public housing agency in the provision of gateway training or services shall have no effect on the amount of operating assistance to such agency under the United States Housing Act. Directs the Secretary to review at least annually compliance with this Act by public housing agencies receiving gateway program grants. Sets forth procedures for withholding grant payments in cases of agency noncompliance. Authorizes appropriations. Title VI: Homeless Youth Demonstration Projects - Homeless Youth Demonstration Project Act of 1990 - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish up to three demonstration projects to provide a network of comprehensive services for homeless youth. Authorizes appropriations. Title VII: Plan for Cooperation - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a plan concerning the programs to be carried out under this Act."
