    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-07-10", 
    "text": "National Teacher Act of 1990 - Title I: Recruitment - Part A: Loan Forgiveness for Teachers Demonstration Program - Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary, for purposes of this Act) to assume the obligation to repay specified portions of a Stafford loan (a student loan made, insured, or guaranteed under specified provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965) for any borrower employed as a full-time teacher: (1) in a school which qualifies for loan cancellation for Perkins loan recipients who teach in such schools; and (2) of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special education, bilingual education, or any other field of expertise where the State educational agency (SEA) determines there is a shortage of qualified teachers. Provides for cancellation of increasing portions of such student loans for a one- to five-year period of such teaching service. Provides also for forgiveness of portions of student loans for borrowers who return to higher education after graduation to obtain a teaching certificate. Provides for repayment of such specified portions of principal and interest by the Secretary to the eligible lender or holder. Part B: Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to extend through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations for the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program (with an increased funding level for FY 1991). Part C: Teacher Corps - Authorizes a new Teacher Corps program. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) make grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to conduct teacher corps activities; and (2) award scholarships to teacher corps members. Bases the amounts of such grants to SEAs on school-age population. Directs the Secretary to: (1) disseminate information about availability of teacher corps scholarships; and (2) foster communication among teacher corps members. Specifies authorized uses of grant money by SEAs. Allows LEAs to use grant funds to: (1) carry out induction programs for new teacher corps members (and other new teachers); and (2) ensure that teacher corps members participate in one for at least one year, including work with a designated mentor teacher. Requires the SEA, in cooperation with the State higher education agency, to select teacher corps members according to its own criteria. Requires special consideration for those who intend to teach students with disabilities, limited English proficient students, or preschool age children. Requires priority consideration for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with disabilities, who are underrepresented in the teaching profession or in the curricular areas in which they are preparing to teach. Sets forth individual application requirements. Sets forth SEA and LEA grant application requirements. Requires descriptions of teacher shortages, corps members' employment placement, and induction programs for corps members and other new teachers. Makes individuals eligible to receive such scholarships for up to three years during enrollment in any of the following programs of study: (1) a baccalaureate or associate degree; (2) one or two post-baccalaureate years of a masters or specialist degree or teaching certificate; or (3) two years of an associate's degree in early childhood education or development, or one year of a child development associate credential program. Makes individuals pursuing the aforementioned kinds of post-baccalaureate study eligible to receive such a scholarship during any of the first three years they are employed as a teacher, in order to defray the costs of such study. Makes individuals with a bachelor's degree who wish to enter teaching from another profession eligible for such a scholarship for the instruction necessary to enter the teaching profession in the State where they wish to teach. Allows such instruction to be provided while the individual is employed as a provisional teacher, at the discretion of the SEA and LEA. Limits the amount of such a scholarship to an individual to the lesser of $5,000 per year or the cost of attendance for a maximum of three years. States that such scholarship shall be considered in determining eligibility for student assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Requires scholarship agreements to include assurances of: (1) satisfactory academic progress and participation in teaching-related activities during a course of study which meets State requirements for teacher preparation; and (2) teaching for five years in a school which qualifies for Perkins loan cancellation for its teachers. Allows members to transfer to another such school in an LEA within the State or to another State with a program, upon approval of the sending or receiving LEA or State. Prescribes additional assurances such agreements must include. Provides for repayment of scholarships and for cancellation of such obligation under specified conditions. Provides for publication of, and recruitment for, the teacher corps scholarship program, particularly for minority students. Authorizes appropriations for such new Teacher Corps program for FY 1991 through 1995, but conditions such funding upon the attainment of a specified minimum funding level for the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program. Limits the portion of Teacher Corps program funds which may be used for LEA induction and mentor programs for new corps members and other new teachers. Part D: Foreign Language Competence for the Future - Foreign Language Competence for the Future Act of 1990 - Amends the Star Schools Program Assistance Act (title IX of the Education for Economic Security Act) to authorize appropriations in necessary amounts for FY 1993 to carry out Star Schools program assistance. Requires applications for such assistance for instructional programming to provide assurances that such programming will be designed in consultation with teachers of the applicable subject matter and grade level. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible consortia to: (1) operate critical languages and area studies programs; (2) develop and acquire educational equipment and materials; and (3) develop teacher training programs, texts, curricula, and other activities designed to improve and expand the instruction of foreign languages at elementary and secondary schools. Limits the maximum amount of such a demonstration grant to an eligible consortium in any single fiscal year. Requires that a consortium eligible for such demonstration grants consist of a cooperative effort between entities in one or more States that must include at least: (1) one institution of higher education; (2) one secondary school with experience in teaching critical foreign languages; and (3) one secondary school in which at least 25 percent of the students are eligible to be counted under certain provisions for education of disadvantaged students (under Chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965). Allows such consortia to include a not-for-profit organization to provide services not otherwise available from the other entities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995. Part E: Miscellaneous Provision - Amends HEA provisions for Perkins loan cancellation to allow: (1) the Secretary to use the previous year's list of eligible schools if a new list is not available before May 1 of any year; and (2) any teacher to continue to receive loan forgiveness in subsequent years of service at a school that loses such eligibility. Title II: Teacher Enhancement - Part A: National Teacher Academies - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to institutions of higher education, private nonprofit education organizations, or combinations of such entities to establish and operate national teacher academies.
