    "text": "Satellite Television Fair Marketing Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require anyone who encrypts satellite delivered programming for private viewing to: (1) make it available for private viewing by home satellite antenna users; (2) establish reasonable character and financial criteria for distributors of such programming; and (3) not discriminate between distributors for cable television subscribers and distributors for satellite antenna users, or among distributors offering similar distribution services to home satellite antenna users. Prohibits the manufacture or sale of equipment which makes possible the reception of encrypted satellite delivered programming without the authorization of the person encrypting such programming. Provides for the private enforcement of this Act. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to undertake a notice of inquiry, conduct a semiannual review, and report to the Congress concerning the effect of decoder price and availability on the ability of consumers to receive satellite television programming. Requires such inquiry to examine: (1) the economic impact on consumers resulting from manufacturers' measures to secure encryption technologies in existing and future devices required to receive satellite television programming; (2) whether lack of competition in the manufacture of home satellite television encryption equipment has produced artificially high consumer prices for such equipment; and (3) whether a single manufacturing licensing source restricts the evolution of competition among various providers of such equipment to distributors, retail entities, and consumers. Requires the FCC to include the development and integration of satellite television encryption and transmission standards in any current and future inquiries regarding high definition television technologies. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the competitiveness of the market for satellite television programming for home satellite antenna owners and, if necessary, to establish remedies to produce a competitive market. Requires the FCC to initiate a rulemaking to facilitate the provision of network broadcasting signals to persons unable to adequately receive a signal over the air from a local licensee."
