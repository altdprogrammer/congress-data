    "text": "Steroid Trafficking Act of 1990 - Title I: Anabolic Steroids - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to add anabolic steroids to Schedule II. Allows any prescription for anabolic steroids subject to refill on or after the date of enactment of this Act to be refilled without restrictions under certain provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. Requires the Attorney General, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to issue regulations that exempt any compound, mixture, or preparation containing a substance covered by this Act from the application of the Controlled Substances Act if, because of its concentration, preparation, mixture, or delivery system, it has no significant potential for abuse. Exempts, at a minimum, estrogens, progestins and corticosteroids. Provides that if a drug listed under this Act is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an accepted treatment for a rare disease or condition, and it does not have a significant potential for abuse, the Attorney General may exempt it from any production regulations necessary to ensure adequate supplies of such drug for medical purposes. Title II: Human Growth Hormone - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to increase the criminal fine and imprisonment penalties for knowing distribution of, or possession with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than treatment of a recognized disease or other medical condition (currently, a recognized disease) pursuant to the order of a physician. Increases the penalties if the offense involves (currently, if the distribution or intended distribution is to) an individual under the age of 18 years. Declares a violation a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act for purposes of forfeiture. Authorizes the Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate such offenses. Repeals provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 relating to forfeiture and illegal trafficking in steroids or a human growth hormone. Title III: Free Speech - Amends provisions of the Federal criminal code relating to racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations to declare that \"racketeering activity\" does not include participation in, or the organization or support of, any nonviolent demonstration, assembly, protest, rally, or similar form of public speech."
