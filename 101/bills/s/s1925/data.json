Requires each eligible institution of higher education participating in any program under student assistance (title IV) provisions of the Act, to prepare, publish, and distribute to all current students and employees, and to any applicant for enrollment or employment, upon request, an annual report containing specified types of information with respect to its campus security policies and campus crime statistics. Requires each such institution to make interim reports on specified types of crimes reported to campus security or local law enforcement authorities, and to distribute such reports to students and employees in a timely manner. Directs the Secretary of Education periodically to survey campus security policies, procedures, and practices and disseminate information on those that have been effective in reducing campus crime."
