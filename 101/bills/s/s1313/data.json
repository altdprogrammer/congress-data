    "text": "Cotton Research and Promotion Act Amendments of 1989 - Amends the Cotton Research and Promotion Act to state that it is the policy of the Congress to authorize assessments on all cotton marketed in the United States, including imports. Includes cotton importers on the Cotton Board (Board). Entitles each State to at least one Board representative. Requires importers to pay their assessments to the Board. Increases from $200,000 to $300,000 the amount that the Secretary of Agriculture may be reimbursed for referendum expenses. Authorizes reimbursement of other Government agency expenses incurred in administering related cotton import provisions. Authorizes the designation of different classes of importers. Provides that assessment rates on imported cotton shall be determined in the same manner as domestic cotton rates, except that import rates shall be reduced to reflect cotton exports that reentered the United States as cotton and cotton products. Provides for producer and importer interim and final referendums of approval or disapproval for such marketing amendments. Provides that importer assessments collected prior to such referendum shall be held in an escrow account and returned (minus an expense deduction) if the final referendum is disapproved. Authorizes cotton marketing referendums every five years upon importer and producer request. Terminates the Board's refund authority upon approval of the referendum provided for by this Act."
