Directs the Secretary to provide, through grants and contracts, for continuing evaluation of State and Federal demonstration projects under this Act. Directs the Secretary to publish summaries and results of evaluative research, and to submit to the appropriate congressional committees copies of all such studies and evaluation summaries. Sets forth application requirements for demonstration grants and rules for membership of advisory committees to monitor and evaluate such projects. Requires that specified reserved funds be used for grants to public and nonprofit private entities for special demonstration projects to be awarded at the discretion of the Secretary. Sets forth problem areas for the focus of such grants. Sets the Federal share of the demonstration grants to States at 90 percent of the cost of project activities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991."
