    "text": "Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to make Foster Care maintenance payments and adoption assistance available for abandoned children. Defines children with handicaps due to drug exposure before birth as \"children with special needs,\" thereby qualifying their adoptive parents for adoption assistance. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to up to ten States for the conduct of demonstration projects for at least five years designed to: (1) provide preventive services and assistance to families which have problems that may lead to the removal of a child from the family; (2) promote the treatment of family problems so that children may be reunified with their family within two years after it became necessary to remove the child from the family; (3) facilitate the timely and permanent placement of children who are in foster care, are boarder babies, have been abandoned at or shortly after birth, have parents addicted to drugs, or were severely abused; or (4) test an innovative approach to any number of other significant child welfare issues. Requires that at least 50 percent of the approved projects address the second objective listed above. Details the information and assurances required to be included in State applications to conduct such project. Authorizes each State which receives project grants to such funds to improve the provision of child welfare, foster care, and adoption assistance services in any manner it deems appropriate. Provides for the evaluation of such demonstration projects. Waives the application of part B (Child-Welfare Services) of title IV of the Social Security Act and other provisions of the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program to States which are conducting such demonstration projects."
