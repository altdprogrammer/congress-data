    "text": "Consumer Seafood Safety Act of 1989 - Prohibits: (1) processing or selling any fish or fish product deemed adulterated under this Act; (2) refusal to permit inspection of a vessel or establishment, or otherwise interfering with any person in carrying out duties under this Act; (3) unauthorized reproduction, alteration, or destruction of any official stamp or certificate; (4) keeping false records or destruction of required records; (5) processing fish without a certificate issued by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary); and (6) importing fish or fish products which fail to comply with all the inspection, good processing practices, and other provisions of this Act. Prescribes fines for the commission of such prohibited acts. Authorizes the Secretary to refuse to provide inspection services to protect the public health, curb persistent violations or enforce the other provisions of this Act. Makes any person who intentionally adulterates fish or fish products guilty of a felony and sets forth imprisonment requirements. Deems fish or fish products adulterated if they: (1) contain any substance hazardous to human health; (2) have not been processed in accordance with provisions of this Act; (3) are made from shellfish harvested in a growing area determined to contain substances that will cause each shellfish to be injurious to health; or (4) are imported from a country that does not use a fish safety program approved by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to identify the chemical and microbiological contaminants, parasites, and toxins which are most likely to be found in fish and fish products and cause fish or fish products to be unsafe for human consumption. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe standards of sanitation and other good processing, storage, and handling for each stage of the processing of fish and fish products; (2) issue a certificate which requires proof of sanitation and storage facilities on an establishment or vessel and implementation of a quality assurance program approved by the Secretary; and (3) prescribe standards for identifying and marking fish or fish products with an official stamp available only for fish and fish products processed at all stages by certified establishments or vessels. Sets forth the circumstances in which a certificate may be suspended. Allows a holder of a suspended certificate to submit a new certification application at any time. Provides for inspection of each establishment or vessel where fish or fish products are processed for interstate commerce. Authorizes the Secretary to direct that any labeling or packaging of fish or fish products which the Secretary has reason to believe is false or misleading be withheld and that any otherwise authorized official mark not be used. Directs the Secretary to publish regulations regarding records describing all activities relevant to food safety and sanitation, with the records available for public inspection. Allows the Secretary, when the Secretary determines that the inspection system of any foreign country is at least equal to the provisions of this Act, to accept certain certificates as compliance with the requirements of this Act. Prohibits any employer from discriminating against any employee because the employee has assisted in the carrying out of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish priorities for fish and fish products safety research; and (2) design and implement a national program for fish and fish products safety education. Directs the Secretary to encourage States to establish inspection programs at least equal to the program established by this Act. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to determine whether a State program is at least equal to the program established by this Act and, if so, to: (1) designate the State as one in which the Federal program does not apply to shipments of fish and fish product in commerce within that State; and (2) annually grant each such State 50 percent of the operating cost of the State program. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
