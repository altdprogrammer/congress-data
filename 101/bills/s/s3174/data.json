    "text": "Amends part B (Child-Welfare Services) of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide Federal funds to enable States to plan, develop, or expand innovative programs of child welfare services and family support services in order to preserve and strengthen families and prevent the need for placement in foster care. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to authorize demonstration projects to improve the coordination of welfare services for families and children. Directs the Secretaries of HHS, Agriculture, and Education and the Attorney General to: (1) review department policies to determine whether changes can be made without statutory changes to improve the funding and delivery of such services; and (2) issue a report to the Congress that includes recommendations for both legislative and nonlegislative changes to improve the coordination of the funding and delivery of such services. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to set forth provisions to facilitate adoption, including provisions allowing States to disregard adoption assistance payments in determining a family's eligibility for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under part A. Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish an Advisory Committee on Foster Care Placement to study and make recommendations regarding the current requirement that States make reasonable efforts to prevent the need for removal of a child from home, and to make it possible for the child to return home, under State plans for foster care and adoption assistance. Requires that a child who is placed in foster care be placed in a setting that is most appropriate for that child. Authorizes demonstration projects to facilitate the reunification of children eligible for AFDC services with their families. Allows States to claim 90 percent Federal matching for the costs of planning, designing, developing, or installing a statewide data collection and information retrieval system for purposes of administering the Child-Welfare Services program and the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program. Allows States to claim 50 percent Federal matching for the costs of operating a data collection and information system for purposes of administering the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program. Revises the independent living program to: (1) allow States to continue independent living services for youths up to age 21 (age 18 as under current law); (2) allow youths in such programs to accumulate assets sufficient to enable them to establish their own households; and (3) allow States to continue to provide foster care maintenance payments for certain youths up to age 21, provided they are active participants in the program and in a full-time education or vocational training program. Includes child placement costs within the scope of allowable Federal matching under the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program Requires States to submit all claims for Federal reimbursement under the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program within one year after the calendar quarter in which the expenditure is made (currently, within two years). Outlines the criteria for the Secretary of HHS to use for approving applications by colleges for grants to provide child welfare traineeships. Permits the Secretary of HHS to authorize up to ten States to establish and evaluate specified types of child welfare demonstration projects. Grants such States more flexible spending authority for such purposes."
