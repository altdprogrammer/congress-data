Applies provisions of Federal law authorizing installment deductions from pay for indebtedness to the United States to members of the uniformed services (currently, the armed forces) as well as employees. Amends the PHSA to prohibit a commissioned medical officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps from receiving additional special pay under specified provisions of the PHSA for any period during which the officer is assigned to a clinical, research, or staff associate program administered by the National Institutes of Health or the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration. Applies provisions of Federal law authorizing special foreign language proficiency pay to members of the uniformed services (currently, the armed forces). Amends the PHSA to entitle commissioned officers of the PHS or their surviving beneficiaries to all the rights and benefits under existing provisions of Federal law relating to retired pay for non-regular service. Amends Federal law to prohibit an officer of the Commissioned Corps of the PHS from being credited with service as a midshipman at U.S. military academies. Applies provisions of Federal law authorizing withholding of District of Columbia and State income taxes to members of the uniformed services (currently, the armed forces). Applies provisions of Federal law prohibiting withholding agreements between Federal officials and cities or counties to members of the uniformed services (currently, the armed forces). Amends Federal law to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants (instead of contracts, as authorized by existing law) for construction of mouse breeding facilities for biomedical research."
