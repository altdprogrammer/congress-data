    "text": "International Climate Change Prevention Act of 1989 - Title I: Focusing Forestry and Energy Cooperation with Key Newly Industrializing, Middle-Income, and Low-Income Developing Nations - Directs the Agency for International Development (AID) to submit to the Congress a report which: (1) examines the potential contributions of developing countries to future global emissions of greenhouse gases under different economic growth scenarios; (2) estimates the relative contributions of such countries to global greenhouse gas emissions; and (3) identifies specific key industrializing, middle-income, and low-income developing countries (key countries) which stand to contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions and in which actions to promote energy efficiency, reliance on renewable energy resources, and conservation of forest resources could significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Authorizes AID to use funds appropriated for the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (the Act) to reimburse U.S. agencies, State agencies, and institutions of higher learning for the full costs of employees detailed or assigned to AID for the purposes of carrying out activities relating to forestry and energy programs aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases related to global warming. Title II: Tropical Forestry Assistance - Requires AID to focus tropical forestry assistance programs on key countries. Allows funds appropriated for the Act to be used by AID to support tropical forestry programs aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases related to global warming with regard to those key countries referred to in this Act in which deforestation makes a significant contribution to global warming. Directs the President, in providing assistance relating to tropical forests, to assist countries in developing a systematic analysis of the appropriate use of their total tropical forest resources. Directs the Administrator of AID to assist the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in its efforts to strengthen their work on tropical forestry. Directs the President, in undertaking tropical forestry-related activities with key countries, to emphasize a cooperative partnership approach. Sets forth specific items for the President to emphasize. Provides that AID's policy dialogue with key countries and other developing countries should: (1) encourage reform of economic and other policies that encourage deforestation and land misuse; and (2) encourage policies that promote sustainable forest land and resource use. States that AID should work with other bilateral and multilateral donors to increase support for assistance in conservation and sustainable use of tropical forests. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of State to undertake initiatives to promote multilateral cooperation and stimulate actions by international institutions to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from forests. Title III: Grassroots Involvement in Tropical Forest Ecosystem Management - Authorizes AID to undertake a program to encourage grassroots involvement in tropical forest ecosystem management. Enumerates specifically authorized activities. Title IV: Energy Assistance - Directs AID to focus energy assistance activities on key countries where such assistance would have the greatest impact on reducing emissions from greenhouse gases. Requires such assistance to be focused on improved energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy resources, and national energy plans which include investment in end use efficiency and renewable energy resources. Allows funds appropriated for the Act to be used by AID for the purpose of supporting energy programs aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases related to global warming with regard to key countries. Expresses the sense of the Congress that AID should increase its efforts in the fields of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy planning. States that such increase should take place with respect to key countries and countries with large Economic Support Fund project assistance. Enumerates what such efforts should include. Provides that the policy dialogue undertaken by AID should encourage: (1) reform of economic and other policies that encourage construction of new energy facilities in lieu of more cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency measures or that encourage wasteful use of existing energy; (2) the adoption of policies that provide incentives for increasing the efficiency of energy use in all sectors; (3) the development of \"least cost\" energy-sector investment plans; (4) the reform of energy pricing regimes so that electricity tariffs more closely meet the long-run marginal cost of supply and so that fossil fuel prices more closely meet international prices; and (5) more efficient market structures for traditional biomass fuels. Directs AID to work with other bilateral and multilateral donors to increase support for assistance in energy policy, energy planning, and energy efficiency. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991. Title V: Multilateral Programs - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director to each multilateral development bank to promote the adoption by that bank of a policy to achieve a maximum impact from activities relating to energy and tropical forestry by focusing such activities on the key countries whose actions in the areas of energy and forestry could have a substantial impact on the reduction of emissions of the greenhouse gases related to global warming."
