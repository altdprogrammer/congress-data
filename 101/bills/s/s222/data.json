Directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct research and development through the Department of Energy, enter into cooperative research and development agreements to promote high temperature superconductivity technologies for power production at coal mine mouth plants, and promote the development of certain clean coal technologies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1995."
