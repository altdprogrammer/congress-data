    "text": "Comprehensive Assistance to Substance Abusing Families Act of 1990 - Title I: Provisions Relating to the Public Health Service Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish: (1) a program to gather information concerning existing impediments in Federal laws, regulations, and practices that interfere with the provision of comprehensive, coherent local treatment services to parents with drug or alcohol problems, especially pregnant and post-partum women, and with the provision of comprehensive, coherent preventive services to children, youth, and families at risk; and (2) an Interagency Committee on Parental Drug and Alcohol Abuse. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to establish challenge grant programs for State and local entities through the establishment of interagency demonstration projects to assist: (1) parents with alcohol and drug problems, including pregnant and post-partum women, and their children; and (2) youth at risk of alcohol and drug problems. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to inform the public of any dangers to maternal and child health resulting from drug and alcohol use during the pregnancy and post-partum period. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and make grants to States to assist in the development and distribution of educational programs and materials and public service announcements. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, through the Director of the Office for Treatment Improvement and the Director of the Office of Maternal and Child Health, to make grants to eligible entities for the establishment of pilot programs at not fewer than 20 State and local jails or prisons to provide comprehensive drug and alcohol abuse treatment services for women and, in the event of pregnancy, prenatal and post-partum care. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States to assist in developing statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency systems to provide early intervention and family preservation services for families at risk of drug and alcohol abuse and their children. Allows States, notwithstanding any other provision of law and in addition to amounts made available under this Act, to use amounts made available under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to family preservation services. Requires matching State funds in a specified percentage. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to make grants to between ten and 15 States to establish model coordinated education, health, and social service programs for children, especially children living in areas of concentrated poverty and social dislocation, including services relating to health or mental health, education, early education and child care, welfare, juvenile justice, alcohol and drug prevention and treatment, or other social services that can be shown to be effective in preventing long-term damage. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Provisions Relating to the Social Security Act - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to presume that any child is disabled or blind if the child is under the age of four years and has a genetic, congenital, or alcohol or drug related impairment, the medical severity of which cannot be accurately determined because the child is too young, and with respect to whom the Secretary has determined that it is probable that, when the child is older, a test will demonstrate that the child suffers from an impairment of sufficient severity to qualify the child for benefits under such title. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to allow a State, under its Medicaid plan, to furnish free-standing alcohol and drug treatment services and related case management services to alcoholic and drug dependent women of child-bearing age eligible for assistance under the title who desire to rid themselves of drug and alcohol problems. Title III: Provisions Relating to Education - Amends the Head Start Act to require that special consideration for enrollment opportunities under the Head Start Program be provided to children who were born exposed to alcohol or drugs. Directs the Secretary of Education to prepare a report concerning the preparedness of the school system of the United States to meet the special needs of children born affected by alcohol or drugs. Title IV: Provisions Relating to Other Acts - Amends provisions of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act setting forth certain definitions to add references to children who are affected by the alcohol or drug abuse of their mother. Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to authorize appropriations to carry out specified provisions of that Act. Amends provisions of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 relating to the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to allow State program agencies to include residential alcohol and drug treatment programs serving pregnant women and juveniles in their special supplemental food program. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to increase the budget authority available under specified provisions, to be used only in connection with certain existing housing programs for occupancy by families where the provision of housing is a significant factor in avoiding initial or continued placement of a child in foster care. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 and the United States Housing Act of 1949 to prohibit considering the temporary absence of a child from the home due to placement in foster care in considering family composition and family size. Requires the Indian Health Service to make grants to entities to provide assistance to drug and alcohol abuse treatment programs, relating to Native American pregnant and post-partum women and their infants, that meet certain requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Replaces Public Health Service Act provisions authorizing grants for drug and alcohol abuse prevention, education, and treatment for pregnant and post-partum women and their infants with provisions directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Director of the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, to make grants to provide assistance to outpatient and residential drug and alcohol abuse treatment programs relating to pregnant and post-partum females and their infants. Requires the grants to be reasonably distributed among outpatient and residential programs. (Current law requires grants to be distributed among inpatient, outpatient, and residential programs.) Requires grant recipients to provide, arrange for, or refer individuals to specified services. Requires non-Federal matching funds in a specified percentage. Authorizes appropriations."
