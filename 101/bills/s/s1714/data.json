Retitles the Act as the United States Commission on Civil Rights Act of 1989. Sets up an eight-person Commission, appointed by the President and congressional leaders. Adds to the Commission's duties (in addition to the study of discrimination on the basis of color, race, religion, sex, age, national origin or disability) the study of discrimination based on language. Gives the Commission authority to file amicus curiae briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court in certain circumstances. Establishes other Commission operations and procedures, including annual reports, voting rights reports, prohibitions on the collection of information on abortion, administrative functions, hearings procedures, and other matters. Authorizes appropriations."
