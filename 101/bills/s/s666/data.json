    "text": "Title I - Authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to enroll certain individuals as Natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and entitles such individuals to receive shares of stock in Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated and such other benefits as the Board of Directors of that corporation may approve. Prohibits any individual enrolled pursuant to this Act from being entitled to share in any dividends or Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act distributions made by the United States or that corporation prior to the individual's enrollment. Provides that enrollment of these individuals shall not alter the entitlement to or distribution of land to Cook Inlet Region, Inc., under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Title II - Admiralty Island National Monument Land Management Act of 1990 - Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into land acquisition agreements and cooperative agreements with Kootznoowoo, Inc., to improve the management of Federal lands on Admiralty Island, Alaska. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within 18 months on the status and results of negotiations with Kootznoowoo. Requires any lands on Admiralty Island acquired by the United States under this Act to be incorporated within the Admiralty Island National Monument. Authorizes land exchanges to consolidate Federal land ownership. Renames the Admiralty Island National Monument Wilderness as the Kootznoowoo Wilderness. Provides a legislative settlement to litigation between Kootznoowoo, Inc., and the Secretary over the ownership of the Angoon Administrative Site. Confirms in the United States all rights, title, and interest to land lying within specified boundaries and specified lands within such site adjacent to the mean high tide line of Kootznoowoo Inlet which the Secretary dedicates for uses related to administration of the Tongass National Forest. Conveys the remainder of such lands to Kootznoowoo, Inc., by quitclaim deed. Retains an easement for road and utility access. Title III - Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to authorize the board of directors of a Native Corporation that elected to allow the termination of restrictions on sales of Settlement Common Stock on December 18, 1991, to rescind such election without a shareholder vote at any time prior to January 1, 1991, and to retain such period of alienability restrictions until such time after December 18, 1991, when they are terminated by other affirmative action. Bars a civil action that challenges the constitutionality of such authorization unless it is filed within one year of the date of the vote of the board of directors approving a resolution to rescind a prior opt-in election."
