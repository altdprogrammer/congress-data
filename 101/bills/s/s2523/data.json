Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to exempt from specified dredging and fill prohibitions wetland that has been traditionally devoted to crop production. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to require the Secretary to make every effort to: (1) sell Farmers Home Administration inventory land without placing any permanent conservation easements on it; or (2) sell such land easement-free before transferring it to a third party."
