    "text": "Global Ban on Dangerous Pesticides Act - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to prohibit the export of any unregistered pesticide to a foreign country unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that the benefits of such export to a country would be greater than the benefits resulting from the prohibition on such export. Makes it unlawful to knowingly export an unregistered pesticide, device, or active ingredient in violation of this Act. Requires the Administrator to initiate discussions with members of the United Nations to convene an international conference to prohibit the use of pesticides that: (1) do not meet the requirements for registered pesticides; or (2) are considered to create an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment by an organization qualified to assess the risks of pesticides. Directs the conference participants, in prohibiting the use of a pesticide, to consider: (1) the environmental costs and public health benefits associated with the use of such pesticide; and (2) the availability of an alternative pesticide or agricultural method that does not necessitate the use of such pesticide. Requires the Administrator to report to the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on the actions taken to convene such conference."
