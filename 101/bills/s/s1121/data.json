Authorizes the construction of recreational facilities in excess of the amount required to replace or relocate existing facilities. Provides that the costs of such construction shall be borne equally by the United States and Wyoming. Repeals a prior authorization of appropriations and authorizes to be appropriated for the Federal share of the construction of the Buffalo Bill Dam and Reservoir modifications and recreational facilities the sum of $80,000,000 (October 1988 price levels). Repeals a requirement that such sums authorized to be appropriated for construction, operation, maintenance, and replacement be reduced by the amounts of certain contributions."
