    "text": "Tech-Prep Education Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to pay the Federal share of the cost of activities carried out under this Act to consortia of: (1) local educational agencies or area vocational schools serving secondary school students; and (2) community colleges (including postsecondary vocational technical schools). Sets the Federal share at: (1) 80 percent of first year planning costs; (2) 60 percent of second year implementation and operation costs; (3) 40 percent of third year operating costs; and (4) 20 percent of fourth and fifth year operating costs. Requires each grant recipient to use the grant funds to develop and operate a four-year technical preparation education program. Requires such program to consist of the two years of secondary school preceding higher education, with a common core of required proficiency in mathematics, science, communications, and technologies designed to lead to an associate degree in a specified career field. Directs the Secretary to ensure an equitable distribution of assistance among States and among urban and rural consortium participants, with special consideration to applications which: (1) provide for effective employment placement activities or transfer of students to four-year baccalaureate degree programs; (2) demonstrate commitment to continue the program after termination of assistance under this Act; and (3) are developed in consultation with business, industry, and labor unions. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1994 to carry out this Act."
