    "text": "National Heritage Conservation Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a biennial \"State of the National Parks\" report to document the condition of the national parks, including appropriate baseline information and documentation of problems related to their degradation and solutions to such problems. Directs that each report be issued to the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and to the President of the United States Senate for consideration by the appropriate congressional committees. Directs the Secretary to: (1) maintain a complete and current list of all national landmarks which meet the criteria specified in the report; and (2) promulgate specified criteria for designating a national landmark as endangered. Sets forth procedures by which the Secretary shall list such endangered historic places. Directs the Secretary to initiate a program to prepare heritage protection strategies for units of the National Park System in order to develop specific programs of cooperation among the service, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the private sector addressing current and potential factors and forces affecting such units. Sets forth procedures for the preparation of such strategies. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local and State governments for assisting in the preparation of such a strategy. Allows the Secretary, under certain conditions, to provide grants to State and local governments to facilitate the implementation of the strategy. Requires the Secretary to review such approved strategies regularly to ensure that they continue to meet the requirements of this Act. Provides that Federal activities which may affect National Park System units with an approved strategy shall be consistent with it. Requires the Secretary to enter into national landmark conservation agreements providing for long-term conservation of sites. Authorizes grants, under certain conditions, to: (1) assist owners and local governments in the preparation of the agreement; and (2) facilitate its implementation. Establishes a policy to protect any nationally significant heritage resource from adverse Federal actions, with exceptions for national security and disasters. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the granting of Federal assistance to an applicant for property improvement if the applicant has created or permitted activities that caused an adverse affect on a nationally significant heritage resource. Amends the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 with respect to Federal actions that affect National Register properties. Authorizes appropriations."
