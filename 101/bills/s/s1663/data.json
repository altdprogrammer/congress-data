    "text": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fleet Modernization Act of 1989 - Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a fleet modernization and expansion program and to implement that program over a ten-year period beginning in FY 1990. Sets forth elements which must be included in the plan and a specific schedule for FY 1990 through 1992, including requirements relating to an oceanographic research vessel and a fisheries research vessel. Authorizes NOAA to fill ten additional personnel positions in connection with the modernization and expansion. Requires that an implementation plan be submitted to the Congress. Authorizes the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, notwithstanding specified provisions and if the Under Secretary makes certain findings, to enter into multi-year contracts and leases for the construction or purchase of property, including vessels, and multi-year leases of property and services. Authorizes the Under Secretary to provide in each contract or lease agreement for the liability of the United States in the event of termination of the contract or agreement before expiration of its term. Requires all modernization, construction, conversion, and repair work performed on vessels under this Act to be carried out, and all vessels acquired by NOAA after enactment of this Act to have been built, in private shipyards in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1992. Requires, prior to any vessel acquisition, an inventory of U.S. vessels acquired by default under the Merchant Marine Act to determine whether any are suitable for NOAA use."
