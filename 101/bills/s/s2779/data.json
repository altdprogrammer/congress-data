    "text": "Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990 - Prohibits any funds, credits, guarantees, or insurance made available for FY 1990 or thereafter from being used to support any U.S. financial or commercial operation involving the Iraqi Government. Instructs the Department of Commerce to include Iraq within the Country Group S list of the Export Administration Regulations. Makes persons violating the prohibition subject to penalties under the Export Administration Act of 1979. Considers Iraq to be a supporter of international terrorism for purposes of applying prohibitions or restrictions under foreign assistance statutes. Prohibits the President from using the waiver authority under such statutes with respect to Iraq. Amends the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1990 to prohibit Export-Import Bank assistance to Iraq under any circumstances. (Current law permits a waiver of such prohibition if it is in U.S. national interest.) Directs the President to study and report to the Appropriations Committees on: (1) the sale, export, and third party transfer or development of nuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic missile technology to or with Iraq; and (2) Iraq's offensive military capability and its effect on the Middle East balance of power. Requires the President to report to such committees on steps taken by other nations to curtail exports to Iraq which might contribute to Iraq's nuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic missile capability. Directs the President to encourage other nations to adopt sanctions toward Iraq similar to those under this Act."
