    "text": "Agricultural Water Quality Incentive Act of 1990 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an agricultural water quality incentive program to encourage agricultural producers to reduce surface and groundwater contamination, with emphasis on practices that increase farm profitability and productivity. Requires participants to: (1) develop a farm water quality management plan; and (2) enter into minimum five-year program contracts. Establishes 1991 through 1995 program acreage levels. Provides participants with annual incentive payments ($3500 maximum) on a per acre basis. Gives priority to land with the potential for surface or groundwater contamination. Provides for demonstration and model farm programs. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to make eligible for the conservation reserve program land that is not highly erodible but is subject to surface and groundwater contamination."
