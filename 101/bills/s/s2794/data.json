Increases the cash value of life insurance and burial fund accounts which is excluded from a beneficiary's resources for SSI purposes. Treats income received on a weekly or biweekly basis as being received on a regular monthly basis at the same annual rate if such treatment would render the payee eligible for SSI benefits. Preserves the Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) eligibility of individuals who lose their SSI blindness or disability benefits upon entitlement to old-age or spouse's insurance benefits under the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program (title II of the Social Security Act). Treats unemployment compensation and worker's compensation as earned income for SSI purposes."
