Precludes any State from having more than one demonstration district. Requires each demonstration district to adopt and follow a local rule which requires the court, at the request of the defendant or the Government (except upon an affirmative finding by the court that the interests of justice require otherwise), to permit the defendant or his attorney and the attorney for the Government each a minimum of 30 minutes to conduct an oral examination of the prospective jury. Specifies that such rule shall: (1) allow additional time for examination by the attorneys at the court's discretion; (2) allow the court to conduct its own examination and to impose reasonable limitations with respect to the questions allowed during such voir dire examination; and (3) allow each side an additional ten minutes for each additional defendant, provided that the total time required shall not exceed one hour per side. Makes decisions made by a court under such rule non-reviewable except for an abuse of discretion. Directs the Judicial Conference to: (1) study the experience of the district courts under the demonstration program authorized by this Act; and (2) transmit to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees a report on the results of such demonstration program."
