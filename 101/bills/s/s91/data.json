    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit any person from lobbying a Federal agency, commission, or court on behalf of anyone other than the United States if compensation for such lobbying is contingent upon: (1) any action of the Congress or the passage or defeat of legislation; or (2) the securing or the denial of a Federal grant or contract or other Federal financial assistance. Exempts lobbying to collect a debt or claim owed by the Government. Sets forth criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action to enforce this Act and to recover twice the amount of proceeds obtained due to prohibited conduct. Establishes a six-year statute of limitations for such actions."
