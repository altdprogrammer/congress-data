    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-09-19", 
    "text": "Federal Triangle Development Act Amendments of 1990 - Amends the Federal Triangle Development Act to exempt from any State and local sales taxation any materials, supplies, equipment, and goods connected with the development of the Federal Triangle property. Declares that no transfer or lease made pursuant to this Act, or an instrument executed in connection with financing development of such property shall be subject to State or local real or personal property tax, recordation tax, transfer tax, or special assessment. Applies State and local sales, use, and similar tax laws to any nonprofit entity established for the exclusive purpose of operating, maintaining, and managing the international cultural and trade center as though it were the International Cultural and Trade Center Commission, with respect to materials, supplies, equipment, goods, labor, or services. States that no lease or sublease of space by the Commission or a nonprofit entity pursuant to this Act shall be subject to State or local real or personal property tax, recordation tax, transfer tax, or special assessment. Grants the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation authority to obtain financing for the development of the Federal Triangle property from appropriate persons (including Federal agencies and instrumentalities). Provides for the Board of Directors of the Corporation to increase the rate of pay of a maximum of three of its officers or employees to that of the Senior Executive Service. Adds the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to the International Cultural and Trade Center Commission. Prohibits the Commission staff from being composed of more than 15 individuals after the center's occupancy date (thus permitting a larger staff up to such date). States that, on or before the center's occupancy date, personnel shall be detailed and office space, supplies, equipment, and support services shall be provided on a nonreimbursable rather than (as under current law) reimbursable basis. Excludes certain operation and maintenance expenses from the limit on overhead expenses of the center. Authorizes appropriations for the Commission and the center through FY 1992. Provides for reimbursement of the Commission by a Federal agency for any program the agency requests. Provides for annual payment to the General Services Administration (GSA) for various costs related to lease of space for the center. Authorizes nonprofit entities that manage the international cultural and trade center to purchase supplies directly from GSA. Defines occupancy date as the later of either: (1) the date on which construction of the building is substantially completed pursuant to this Act; or (2) the date on which all areas of the center are substantially available for public use and occupancy."
