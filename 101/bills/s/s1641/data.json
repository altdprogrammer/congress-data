    "text": "Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 - Title I: United States Policy in Eastern Europe - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should implement, beginning in FY 1989, a program to support East European democracies by providing assistance to Eastern European countries which have taken substantive steps toward institutionalizing political democracy and economic pluralism. Designates support for East European democracy activities as SEED. Title II: Enterprise Funds in Poland and Hungary - Authorizes the President to designate two private, nonprofit organizations as the Polish-American Enterprise Fund and the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund to promote development of the Polish and Hungarian private sectors. Requires the President to contribute to such Funds a specified amount of unobligated Department of Defense (DOD) funds. Allocates such funds and earmarks a specified amount for private agricultural development in Poland. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992. Requires the President to designate an executive agency to contribute such monies to the Funds. Permits the agency to use a specified amount of such monies for carrying out functions under this title.

Authorizes grants to be made to the Funds only if the Funds are in compliance with this title. Provides for annual audits of the Funds. Requires the Funds to ensure that: (1) each recipient of Fund assistance keeps separate accounts and financial records; and (2) the Funds have access to such records for audit purposes. Directs each Fund to publish annual reports. Title III: Labor Market Transition - Requires the Secretary of Labor to provide technical assistance to Poland and Hungary for the implementation of labor market reform and to facilitate adjustment during the period of economic transition and reform.

Requires the Administrator to cooperate with Polish officials and experts to: (1) establish an air quality monitoring network in the Krakow metropolitan area; and (2) improve water quality and the availability of drinking water in such area. Directs the Administrator to work with U.S. and Hungarian officials and private parties to establish and support a center in Budapest, Hungary, for facilitating cooperative environmental activities between governmental experts and U.S. and Eastern and Western European organizations. Title V: Diminishing the Burden of Bilateral and Multilateral Debt - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the debt payments owed by Poland to the United States which are payable during FY 1990 through 1994 should be rescheduled and made a part of the principal payment due in FY 1995; and (2) the President should urge all members of the Paris Club creditor governments to adopt a similar debt rescheduling program for Poland. Requires the President to take all appropriate actions to explore and encourage innovative approaches to the reduction of debt of Eastern European countries which have taken substantive steps toward political democracy and economic pluralism. Urges the President to exercise all available authority to undertake the discounted sale of U.S. debt obligations to private purchasers to facilitate debt-for-equity swaps under which such privatized debt is exchanged for an equity interest in an Eastern European enterprise which is involved in SEED activities. Title VI: \"Take-Off\" Telecommunications Grant to Poland - Makes available a specified amount of unobligated FY 1990 DOD funds for a grant to an entity designated by the President for the modernization of Poland's telephone and telecommunications infrastructure by means of competitively bid contracts to U.S. corporations. Requires the President to take steps necessary to ensure the protection of militarily significant telecommunications technology. Title VII: Facilitating Voluntary Action - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should encourage monetary and food contributions from U.S. civic, religious, school, and youth organizations for assistance to Poland and Rumanian refugees in Hungary. Declares that the President should draw upon all available authorities, use resources of the National Guard and DOD, request additional authorities as necessary, and encourage maximum participation by recognized private voluntary organizations to transport nonfinancial contributions to Poland. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should encourage the establishment of sister institution programs between U.S. and East European schools, universities, cities, and specified organizations. Title VIII: Policy Coordination and \"SEED\" Information System - Requires the President to designate a Coordinator of SEED Program Action within the Department of State. Directs the President to take steps to establish a SEED information center to serve as a clearinghouse for information relating to business needs and opportunities in, and voluntary assistance to, Eastern Europe. Requires such center to encourage economically sound proposals to the Funds and other finance sources for the development of private enterprise in Eastern Europe. Provides that such center shall be based in Washington, Warsaw, and Budapest. Title IX: Trade and Assistance Benefits and Investment Treaties - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to remove Poland from the list of countries ineligible for designations as beneficiary developing countries. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should immediately take steps to designate Poland as a beneficiary country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences provided for in such Act. Requires the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to support projects in Poland and Hungary to enhance the nongovernmental sector and reduce state involvement in the economy. Provides that OPIC's authorities with respect to Poland and Hungary shall remain in effect until September 30, 1992. Makes Poland and Hungary eligible for U.S. Export-Import Bank programs until such date.

Title XIII: Peace Corps - Transfers specified FY 1990 DOD funds to the Peace Corps for establishing programs in Hungary and Poland. Title XIV: Food Aid - Sets forth the strategy of the food assistance program. Requires the President to promote a comprehensive multilateral food assistance program for Poland. Allocates specified amounts for such assistance in FY 1989 and 1990. Declares the readiness of the Congress to act promptly on authority and appropriations requests so that the United States may call on the European Community to increase food assistance to Poland on a matching basis. Makes Poland and Hungary eligible for programs under the Agricultural Act of 1949 and the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Makes such eligibility effective until September 30, 1992. Title XV: Multilateral Action - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should consult with the European Community, Japan, and other members of the Paris Club to establish a comprehensive, multiyear program for Poland and Hungary to facilitate enduring economic recoveries and to institutionalize political democracy and economic pluralism. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States, if Poland initiates steps to dismantle state controls and subsidies and inaugurates a plan of economic stabilization, should advocate action on the following goals in multilateral negotiations with regard to Poland: (1) a Paris Club agreement on a four year deferral of all government-to-government debt repayments; (2) a multilateral currency stabilization loan; (3) an International Monetary Fund loan; and (4) a World Bank loan to assist in the relocation of workers from state firms to the private sector. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should exercise international leadership in sponsoring the creation of: (1) a multinational advisory task force of economic experts to assist the Polish Government in formulating reforms to satisfy conditions for multilateral assistance; and (2) a multinational committee of senior statesmen to provide long-range analysis and stimulate support for the transition of Eastern European countries to political and economic pluralism.
