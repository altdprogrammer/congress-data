    "text": "Medigap Amendments of 1990 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require a State with a federally-approved Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policy regulatory program to annually report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on its program, including information as to the frequency with which State-approved policies fail to meet Federal standards. Gives the Secretary the authority to: (1) revoke State regulatory programs which are not adequately implemented; (2) give States technical assistance in implementing or improving such regulatory programs; and (3) provide grants to States with an approved regulatory program to assist them in strengthening enforcement of program requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop annual reports for each State comparing Medigap policies issued in the State on certain matters that may be useful to potential purchasers; and (2) provide information via a toll-free telephone number on Medicare programs and Medigap policies. Imposes certification fees on federally-certified Medigap policies. Requires policies that are up for Federal certification renewal to provide rebates or premium reductions to offset previous violations of loss ratio standards. Prohibits the issuance of a Medigap policy in a State without a federally-approved regulatory program or without its receiving Federal certification unless such policy clearly indicates that it has not received Federal certification and the purchaser acknowledges that fact. Requires that Federal standards for Medigap policies be revised to: (1) establish a uniform language and format for policies; (2) require the calculation, reporting, and review of policy loss ratios; and (3) include standards concerning an alternative minimum benefits policy that excludes first dollar coverage and is significantly less expensive than the standard minimum benefits policy. Conditions Federal certification of a Medigap policy on its issuer offering individuals a minimum benefits policy as an alternative to such policy and listing the price of such alternative policy. Authorizes Federal certification of a Medigap policy which would meet Federal standards but for the restriction of its benefits to items and services furnished by certain entities if: (1) full benefits are provided for items and services through a network of entities which have contracted with the policy issuer; (2) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished by other entities when such items and services are necessary and cannot reasonably be obtained through the network; (3) the network offers sufficient access; and (4) the policy issuer has arranged ongoing quality assurance of the items and services furnished through the network. Sets the acceptable loss ratio for such policies. States that Medicare health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans are not subject to Medigap policy standards."
