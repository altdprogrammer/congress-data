    "text": "Repeals estate tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding inclusion in the gross estate of the value of certain types of transfers with a retained life estate. Applies the repeal retroactively in connection with property transferred after December 17, 1987. Establishes special valuation rules for determining whether a transfer of an interest in a corporation or partnership to a member of the transferor's family is a gift. Provides for determining the valuation of any retained rights, interests, and distribution rights. Provides for determining the value of cumulative but unpaid distributions by corporations or partnerships. Provides that a gift tax statute of limitations does not close for a gift determined after applying the special valuation rule, if such gift was not disclosed on a gift tax return. Sets forth special rules for valuing any interest for life or a term of years in property involving family members. Provides for determining the value of property for transfer tax purposes under certain buy-sell agreements. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the prevalance and type of options and agreements used to distort the value of property for such purposes."
