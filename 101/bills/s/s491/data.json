    "text": "Stratospheric Ozone and Climate Protection Act of 1989 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish a priority list of manufactured substances known or reasonably anticipated to cause atmospheric modification, including stratospheric ozone depletion, and to assign an ozone depletion potential to each substance. Requires the Administrator to list simultaneously and update annually other manufactured substances meeting the same criteria, assigning ozone depletion potentials for each. Includes specified chlorofluorocarbons on each list. Requires producers of substances on either list to report initially and annually to the Administrator on such production until it ceases. Limits production of substances on the priority list to 1986 levels effective July 1, 1989. Requires further scheduled reductions by July 1, 1992, and July 1, 1995. Prohibits the production, effective July 1, 1997, of any quantity of a listed substance unless the Administrator authorizes limited production of such substance for medical purposes. Authorizes the President to issue orders regarding the use of halon-1211, halon-1301, and halon-2402 if the use of such substances is necessary to protect national security interests. Exempts such orders from the requirements of this Act. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations regarding: (1) the use, recapture, recycling, and safe disposal of substances covered by this Act; and (2) the use of any manufactured substance that may exacerbate the problem of human induced global climate change. Prohibits, after 1992, the knowing use, release, or disposal of any substance covered by this Act (with specified exceptions) in a fashion which permits such substance to enter the environment. Exempts from such prohibition releases associated with: (1) the approved use of medical devices and diagnostic products for medical purposes; (2) good-faith attempts to recapture and recycle or safely dispose of such substances; and (3) the servicing or repair of equipment which contains such substances but does not include an aperture which allows the recapture of such substances, if, during the first servicing or repair after the effective date of this Act, an aperture or other such feature is installed. Prohibits, effective July 1, 1997, the introduction into interstate commerce or use of a priority listed substance except for medical purposes and, for a period not to exceed ten years after such date, to maintain and service household appliances. Prohibits the production, effective July 1, 1989, of substances covered by this Act in quantities sufficient for the ozone depletion potential to exceed the level of depletion for any such substance for 1986. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing production limitations for such substances that yield not less than a 95 percent reduction in total ozone depletion in 1997. Provides that if the Administrator fails to promulgate such regulations, it shall be unlawful, effective July 1, 1997, to produce such substances in quantities yielding an ozone depletion potential greater than five percent of the 1986 level of depletion for any such substance. Prohibits imports of such substances or products manufactured using such substances, unless the exporting nation has an equivalent or more stringent production reduction program. Requires the Administrator to certify national programs, such certification to be reviewed annually. Equates imports with production when determining a manufacturer's required reductions. Requires containers of listed substances to carry labeling stating the contents and potential damaging effects. Authorizes the Administrator to assess civil penalties or seek injunctive relief for violations and to revoke any permit for continued noncompliance. Establishes criminal penalties for knowing violations. Sets forth procedures for review of regulations promulgated under this Act."
