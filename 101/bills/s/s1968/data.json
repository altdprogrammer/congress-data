Requires the reports to identify: (1) industries likely to be critical to U.S. economic security and global competitiveness (including industries involving advanced technology, high value-added, and high research and development costs); and (2) industries in other countries which are beneficiaries of government programs (such as tax policies, export promotions, antitrust exemptions, patent policies, technology assistance, or other forms of financial assistance). Requires the annual report to be submitted to the Congress and to include what other countries and the United States are doing to remain or become globally competitive."
