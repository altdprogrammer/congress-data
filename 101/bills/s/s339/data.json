    "text": "Infant Mortality and Childrens Health Act of 1989 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to cover children born after September 30, 1983, whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Authorizes States to continue such coverage for one year after the family's income rises above the Federal poverty level. Phases in mandatory State coverage of pregnant women and infants whose family income is below 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. Deducts child and medical care costs from the income eligibility test. Requires the continuation of such coverage for women through the month in which the 60-day post-partum period expires, and for infants throughout their first year of life. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by July 1, 1990, on State error rates in determining the Medicaid eligibility of pregnant women and infants. Suspends error rate penalties attributable to such eligibility determinations made from July 1, 1989, until one year after the Secretary's report. Permits States to provide Medicaid coverage to all children whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Requires that States make ambulatory prenatal care available to a pregnant woman during a presumptive eligibility period which ends when she is determined to be ineligible for Medicaid benefits or 14 days after she is determined to be eligible, but fails to apply. Amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) of the Act to require States to provide outreach services for Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and infants under such title. Amends the Medicaid program to reimburse States, at the Federal Medicaid assistance percentage, for outreach services identifying Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and infants and assisting them in applying for Medicaid coverage. Requires that States submit information to the Secretary, by April 1 of each year, pertaining to the supply of and demand for obstetrical and pediatric services and proposed Medicaid payment rates for such services so that the Secretary may determine whether such rates are sufficient to ensure that obstetrical and pediatric services will be at least as available to Medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population. Requires States to immediately revise rates determined to be insufficient. Increases, by 25 percent, the Federal share of Medicaid costs attributable to State demonstration projects to reduce infant mortality and childhood morbidity by improving the access of Medicaid-eligible pregnant women, infants, and children to obstetricians and pediatricians. Limits FY 1990 expenditures for such projects. Directs States to adjust Medicaid payments to disproportionate share hospitals to take into account exceptionally costly and lengthy inpatient hospital services for children. Requires States to: (1) coordinate Medicaid services with the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC) under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and (2) notify Medicaid-eligible pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum women and children under age five of WIC program benefits. Directs the Secretary to develop, for use by January 1, 1990, a national toll-free phone number providing basic health information and health care referrals to pregnant women, new mothers, and other interested persons."
