    "text": "Money Laundering Enforcement Act of 1990 - Amends Federal law regarding monetary transactions to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations under which a depository institution must identify its nonbank financial institution customers to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to share such information with State supervisory agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to impose civil penalties for non-compliance with such disclosure requirements. Amends the Federal criminal code to impose penalties for money transmitting businesses operating in violation of State law. Directs the Secretary to promulgate procedures designed to insure that domestic financial institutions guard against money laundering. Prohibits a financial institution or its personnel from disclosing the existence of a geographic targeting order (subjecting financial institutions in a certain area to special reporting requirements for lower dollar thresholds for a limited time). Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to direct the Secretary to prescribe final record-keeping regulations for international monetary transactions made by money transmitting and check cashing businesses and businesses that issue and redeem money orders and travelers checks. Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to extend the period during which: (1) Federal law enforcement agencies may continue receiving information reported to the Internal Revenue Service regarding cash transactions of $10,000 or more; and (2) the IRS may use the income generated by an undercover business operation to cover the expenses of such business. Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) to authorize an agency to transfer financial records to another agency without notice to the customer if the records are within the recipient agency's jurisdiction and relevant for law enforcement purposes. Declares that the RFPA does not apply to financial records transferred by a financial institution to the Secretary for possible violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Exempts such institutions from civil liability under State law for disclosures made in good faith suspicion of customer violations of the Bank Secrecy Act."
