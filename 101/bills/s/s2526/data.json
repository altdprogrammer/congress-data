Directs the Secretary, through the Director and using a competitive selection process, to select: (1) a non-Federal database contractor to create the Program's Federal database and network of experts and to manage them for the duration of the Program; and (2) up to five States for participation in the Program. Provides for fees to be charged to businesses using the Program in certain circumstances. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Small Business Act to allow any Small Business Development Center to apply for an additional grant to increase access by small businesses in its service area to on-line databases to facilitate technology transfer. Specifies ways in which a Center may seek to increase small business access. Authorizes appropriations."
