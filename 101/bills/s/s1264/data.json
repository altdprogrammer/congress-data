Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should achieve required troop reductions through equal annual reductions beginning no later than October 1, 1990. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should initiate discussions with South Korea regarding: (1) the phased-in annual reduction of U.S. troops there; and (2) the kinds and quantities of military equipment needed there after the reduction in U.S. troops. Directs the President to report to the Congress on such troop reduction. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the security and territorial integrity of South Korea."
