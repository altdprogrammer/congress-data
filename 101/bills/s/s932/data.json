    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to set forth the Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act. Prohibits the sale of beer, mineral water, soda water, or carbonated soft drinks in beverage containers by retailers and distributors unless such containers carry a refund value of not less than five cents. Requires that retailers and distributors pay the refund on returned containers of brands sold by such retailers or distributors. Directs the General Accounting Office to study the feasibility of establishing a handler's fee to reflect costs to retailers or redemption centers of handling returned containers. Directs the Administrator, after an opportunity for public comment, to determine whether such fee should be paid, the amount of such fee, and the means by which moneys to pay such fee will be generated. Permits retailers, redemption centers, or distributors to refuse to accept beverage containers without the printed refund value. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate rules and regulations establishing the rights of: (1) retailers to restrict the number of containers redeemed; and (2) distributors to determine the form and condition in which such containers are to be returned to such distributors from retailers or redemption centers. Prohibits distributors and retailers from selling beverages in metal beverage containers with detachable openings. Preempts inconsistent State or local laws. Prohibits State and local governments from imposing any tax on the collection or return of refund values. Imposes penalties of up to $1,000 for violations."
