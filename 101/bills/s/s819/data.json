    "text": "Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1989 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue a final rule regarding Federal motor carrier safety regulations to: (1) establish a public information system that periodically updates the safety ratings of motor carriers which have received unsatisfactory safety ratings; (2) provide a rating reassessment within nine months after receipt of a motor carrier's written request to have an unsatisfactory rating reassessed; and (3) prohibit the operation of certain commercial motor vehicles by motor carriers who have received unsatisfactory safety ratings. Requires the Secretary to submit operational guidelines to the Congress with specific criteria for determining civil penalties for motor carrier safety violations that pose imminent safety hazards. Requires reports not later than January 1, 1991, 1992, and 1993 to the Congress on enforcement actions. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to impose mandatory minimum criminal penalties for the unlawful distribution or possession of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a truck stop or safety rest area. Precludes the suspension of criminal sentences and denies probation for repeat offenders. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish specified sentencing guidelines for violations of this Act. Amends the Truck and Bus Safety and Regulatory Reform Act of 1988 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to initiate a rulemaking proceeding regarding improved braking performance standards for commercial motor vehicles. Classifies Department of Transportation safety inspectors at GS-12 of the General Schedule. Sets a deadline within which the Secretary must establish procedures ensuring the timely correction of commercial motor carrier safety violations found in a nationwide random reinspection system. Directs the Secretary to establish operational procedures requiring highway safety personnel to initiate enforcement actions whenever certain motor carrier safety violations can be documented. Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding for enhanced truck visibility."
