    "text": "Restructuring Schools Act of 1990 - Amends the Fund for the Improvement and Reform of Schools and Teaching Act to establish a program of grants for planning and implementing the restructuring of school organization, school management, or instructional programs in elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make such grants, on a competitive basis and for a three-year period, to such schools, local educational agencies (LEAs), and consortia of such schools or LEAs (with or without nonprofit organizations with relevant experience). Requires grant applications to include a plan for widespread consultation with parents, community members, school system employees, and the private sector in planning and implementing such school restructuring. Requires a school restructuring implementation plan prior to the second grant year. Requires broad geographic distribution in grant awards with special consideration for restructuring plans which benefit: (1) students or a school with below-average academic performance; and (2) eligible entities serving a large number of minority or disadvantaged students. Sets the Federal share at 50 percent, and requires that at least 50 percent of the non-Federal share come from nongovernmental sources. Authorizes appropriations."
