    "text": "Newsprint Recycling Act of 1989 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to require consumers of newsprint to use a certain percentage of recycled paper in printing or publishing operations. Defines \"consumer\" as a person who uses 1000 tons or more annually of newsprint in a commercial printing or publishing operation. Provides for graduated increases in such percentage, to require at least 40 percent of the newsprint used by consumers in the year 2000 to be recycled newsprint. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress, prior to 1999, on whether the recycling program should be modified or expanded. Directs the Administrator to establish regulations to allow newsprint consumers to purchase or sell credits to meet the requirements of this Act. Requires consumers to maintain and make available to the Administrator certain records and to report annually to the Administrator on the amount of newsprint and recycled newsprint used and the number of credits purchased and sold. Prohibits the use of such credits, from 2004 through 2009, unless a specified percentage of the newsprint used by the consumer is recycled. Terminates the use of such credits after 2009. Directs the Administrator to require consumers owning more than one commercial printing or publishing operation to consider such operations as a single operation for purposes of this Act. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
