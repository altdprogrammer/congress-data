Prohibits requiring such a license for works on which there has been no construction since August 26, 1935, if: (1) any part of the stream over or in which the project works have been constructed was non-navigable before that construction; or (2) a declaration of intent was filed and the Commission found that the interest of interstate or foreign commerce would not be affected by such construction. Prohibits the Commission from issuing an original license for proposed project works for which the Act does not presently require a license."
