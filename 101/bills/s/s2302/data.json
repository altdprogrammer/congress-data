    "text": "Agricultural Conservation Reserve and Enhancement Act of 1990 - Title I: Conservation Reserve Program - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the conservation reserve program (CRP) through crop year 1995. Establishes ten-year minimum contracts for soil salinity or off-farm environmentally threatened land placed in the CRP. Permits the Secretary of Agriculture to pay up to 75 percent of CRP wetlands restoration costs. Extends CRP tree acreage through crop year 1995. Directs the Secretary to offer a 15-year CRP contract for acreage devoted to hardwood trees, shelterbelts, or windbreaks. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) offer owners the opportunity to convert CRP acreage planted to grass to hardwood trees; (2) pay up to 75 perent of conversion costs; and (3) permit alley cropping (and related rental reductions) on such converted land and on land on which the owner implements appropriate conservation measures. Authorizes a bid-back program to remove the least highly erodible cropland from the CRP. Provides for specified buffer strip CRP eligibility. Exempts CRP contracts from sequestration orders. Title II: Integrated Farm Plans - Directs the Secretary to establish a cost-sharing program to assist producers in establishing integrated farm plans. Authorizes FY 1992 through 2002 appropriations. Title III: Wetland Provisions - Directs the Secretary to determine the extent to which penalties for minor infractions of the wetland program have not been commensurate with the violation. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to permit the production of native wetland crops under such program. Extends through the 1995 crop year and makes mandatory multiyear set-asides."
