Directs the Secretary to issue standards for the selection of shipping modes and routes used for such transportation. Requires that waste materials be transported in containers certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Directs the Secretary to employ additional safety inspectors for radioactive materials transportation. Requires safety permits for motor carriers which transport certain hazardous materials. Prohibits the removal of hazardous materials identification placards from a container or vehicle until all such materials have been removed. Broadens the scope of violations subject to a civil penalty. Prohibits tampering with any markings, labelings, containers, or vehicles relating to hazardous materials transportation. Requires the Secretary to issue a final rule regarding the safety ratings of motor carriers which have been previously assigned an unsatisfactory rating."
