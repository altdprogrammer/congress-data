    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a research program on new technologies in food safety that includes: (1) developing technology for the rapid identification of infectious agents and toxins on farms and within the processing and distribution chain; (2) establishing a statistical framework for health risk assessment related to contamination of the animal product food chain by these infectious agents and toxins; (3) analyzing the animal product food chain to determine the most effective point for controlling or preventive intervention; and (4) developing techniques to monitor the production, processing, and distribution of food animals and their products in order to detect potential microbiological or chemical agents. Directs the Secretary to: (1) award grants for periods up to five years to pay the Federal share of the costs of funding research projects; (2) seek research proposals and, in so doing, to seek the widest participation from persons eligible for research grants, including entities involved in food safety research; and (3) perform peer review evaluations of proposals, seeking the widest participation of qualified scientists. Sets the Federal share of the grants at 75 percent, but allows the Secretary to increase that to 100 percent if such action is appropriate. Prohibits making a grant for any purpose for which a grant may be made under specified provisions, or for planning, rehabilitation, acquisition, or construction of a facility. Authorizes appropriations."
