    "text": "Communications Competitiveness and Infrastructure Modernization Act of 1990 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission to examine and report to the Congress on the benefits and costs of the provisions of this Act as introduced. Requires that such examination include: (1) a review of certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 which restrict ownership and control of cable systems by any common carrier subject in whole or in part to title II of such Act; and (2) certain determinations regarding video programming activities of telephone companies. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that if the public switched network of a common carrier subject to title II of such Act has the capacity to transmit video programming directly to subscribers, if the common carrier has no editorial control over such video programming, and if such capability is offered on a regulated common carrier basis, then neither the common carrier nor the users of that capability are required to have a cable franchise. Requires the FCC to complete a review of the definition of the term \"rural area\" under the Communications Act of 1934 so as to ensure that all areas of the country have access to a multichannel video service over cable or optic fiber wire as soon as possible. Requires the FCC to adopt policies to ensure that the widest possible diversity of information sources is made available to the public in conducting such proceedings."
