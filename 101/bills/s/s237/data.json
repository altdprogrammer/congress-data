Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture, subject to available appropriations, to carry out a program of intensive management of the commercial forest land of the Tongass National Forest in order to assure the availability of a sufficient supply of timber to achieve an allowable sale quantity of 4.5 billion board feet per decade. Requires the Secretary, each fiscal year, to prepare and offer for sale or release timber volumes on the Tongass National Forest based upon his estimate of the annual demand of the dependent industry and the sustained yield capacity of the forest."
