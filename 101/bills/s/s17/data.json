    "text": "Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1989 - Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue by rule a fire safety standard for cigarettes. Prohibits stockpiling of cigarettes between the issuing and effective dates of the standard. Provides for judicial review of the standard. Prohibits manufacture or importing of a cigarette unless the cigarette is in compliance with a standard issued under provisions of this Act. Declares violation of the prohibition to be a violation of provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act. States that this Act and the standard issued under it does not preempt any law of a State which prescribes a more stringent fire safety standard for cigarettes. Prohibits, in any civil action for damages, admitting as a defense compliance with the standard."
