    "text": "Requires congressional committees to include family impact statements in their reports of public bills or joint resolutions. Makes it not in order for either House of the Congress to consider a public bill or joint resolution if the committee report does not contain such a statement. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to direct the Congressional Budget Office to assist such committees, at their request, to prepare such statements. Requires each executive agency to include a family impact statement in every recommendation or report on a proposal for legislation or other major Federal action significantly affecting families in the United States. Requires each agency to use approaches and develop procedures to give appropriate consideration to potential effects of its proposed actions, decisions, and activities on such families. Requires agency review of existing authorities, rules, and policies and procedures, and a report to the President and the Congress on such review, with recommendations, within one year after enactment of this Act."
