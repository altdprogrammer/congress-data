Declares that the purposes of such negotiations shall be to: (1) establish a list of chemicals contributing to the illicit manufacture of controlled substances; (2) reach international agreements on a method of maintaining records of transactions of such chemicals; (3) establish a procedure by which such records may be made available to U.S. law enforcement authorities for conducting investigations relative to such chemicals; and (4) encourage chemical source countries to enact specified chemical control legislation. Directs the President to impose penalties or sanctions on entities refusing to maintain or make available to U.S. law enforcement authorities records on such chemicals, including prohibiting such entities from engaging in U.S. commerce."
