    "date": "1990-10-26", 
    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a series of studies on the management and utilization of materials in the recycling process. Requires such studies to: (1) focus on one general type of material; (2) evaluate the impact of recycling such material in reducing the volume of waste material that requires disposal; (3) evaluate the adverse environmental impacts and benefits of management of the material; (4) take into account the distinction between bona fide materials in the recycling process and materials considered to be solid waste; and (5) include recommendations for regulation that balances environmental benefits and risks. Directs the Administrator to promulgate a three-tier permitting system to promote the environmentally safe recycling of the material addressed in the study. Requires the Administrator to establish permitting requirements for recycling with minimal, moderate, and substantial impacts on the environment. Directs the Administrator to establish, for recyclers having moderate or substantial impacts on the environment: (1) the percentage of material that must be processed for incorporation into a new product to meet a specified requirement under the Solid Waste Disposal Act; and (2) operating standards and recordkeeping requirements. Authorizes the Administrator to inspect any recycler's facilities or records. Requires recyclers having substantial impacts on the environment to demonstrate to the Administrator that the environmental benefit to be derived from their operations outweighs the potential environmental risk that such operations may pose. Provides that where a substance or practice used in manufacturing could constitute a threat to human health or the environment when the manufactured product is eventually recycled, such substance or practice shall constitute an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment for purposes of the Toxic Substances Control Act. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations to enhance the recyclability of manufactured articles by eliminating toxic materials from the manufacturing process. Authorizes the Administrator to revoke a person's designation as a recycler if such person has violated this Act."
