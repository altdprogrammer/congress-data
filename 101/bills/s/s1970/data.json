    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-07-11", 
    "text": "Title I: Death Penalty - Federal Death Penalty Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, without regard to the rules of evidence, but permits information to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating factors which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the information and aggravating factors which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Includes as threshold aggravating factors for homicide that the defendant: (1) intentionally killed the victim; (2) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury which resulted in the death of the victim; (3) intentionally participated in an act, contemplating that the life of a person would be taken, and the victim died as a direct result of the act; (4) attempted to kill the President of the United States; or (5) intentionally engaged in an act constituting reckless disregard for human life, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death to someone other than the participants, and the victim died as a direct result of the act. Sets forth special aggravating factors with respect to the crimes of treason, espionage, homicide, and attempted murder of the President. States that no person who was less than 17 years of age at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons or pregnant women. Directs the court, or the jury by unanimous vote, to impose the death penalty upon a finding that such sentence is justified based on consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating factors. Requires the court to instruct the jury: (1) not to consider the race, color, national origin, creed, or sex of the defendant or any victim in its consideration of the sentence; and (2) that it is not required to return a death sentence. Requires, prior to hearing any case to determine whether a death sentence is justified and as part of the presentence investigation, the preparation of a victim impact statement which identifies the victim, the physical injury caused, any request for psychological services initiated by the victim as a result of the offense, and any other information related to the impact of the offense on the victim or victim's family as the court may require. Specifies that: (1) the required information may be obtained from the personal guardian of the victim or from family members; and (2) such statement shall be considered by the court or jury. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Requires the Court of Appeals, upon considering the record and the information and procedures of the sentencing hearing, to affirm the decision if: (1) the sentence was imposed under influence of passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness; and (2) the information supports the finding of aggravating factors. Requires the court to provide a written explanation of its determination. Prohibits requiring any employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or any provider of services under contract to participate in any execution if participation is contrary to his or her moral or religious convictions. Bars the imposition of a death sentence for first degree murder committed by or against an Indian in Indian country unless there was in effect at the time of the offense an election by the governing body of the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the place where the offense was committed to have this title apply in such cases. Limits the circumstances under which the offense of delivering defense information to aid foreign governments is punishable by death. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murders committed by prisoners in Federal correctional institutions; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (4) murder for hire; (5) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (6) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death; and (7) other specified offenses. Title II: Habeas Corpus Reform - Amends the Federal judicial code to set forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. Applies such procedures to Federal habeas corpus cases brought by defendants subject to capital punishment and prisoners in State custody who are subject to a capital sentence. Makes the applicability of such procedures contingent upon a State establishing a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable fees and litigation expenses of competent counsel consistent with this title. Sets forth procedures for the appointment of counsel. Provides for a mandatory stay of execution during the post-conviction review initiated pursuant to this Act. Details conditions which will cause such stay to expire. Prohibits a Federal court, if one of such conditions has occurred, from entering a stay of execution or granting relief in a capital case unless: (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented by the prisoner in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim was the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, was the result of Supreme Court recognition of a new fundamental right that is retroactively applicable, or is based on facts that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the filing of any successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus is authorized by the appropriate court of appeals and the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt on the offense for which the death penalty was imposed or newly discovered facts are not based upon opinion evidence which would be sufficient to undermine the court's confidence in the validity of the death sentence. Imposes time limits on filing for habeas corpus relief. Requires such time limits to be tolled under specified conditions. Requires the district court, upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, to rule on the merits of the claims properly before it. Makes the requirement for a certificate of probable cause inapplicable with an exception. States that a mechanism for the provision of counsel services to indigents sufficient to invoke the provisions of this title shall provide for: (1) counsel to indigents charged with offenses for which capital punishment is sought, to those who have been sentenced to death and who seek appellate or collateral review in State court, and to those who have been sentenced to death and seek certiorari review in the U.S. Supreme Court; and (2) the entry of an order of a court of record appointing one or more counsels to represent the prisoner except upon a judicial determination (after a hearing, if necessary) that the prisoner is not indigent or knowingly waives the appointment of counsel. Requires at least one attorney appointed pursuant to this title before trial and one appointed after trial, if applicable, to be certified by a statewide certification authority, with exceptions. Authorizes the States to elect to create between one and three certification authorities (i.e., a special committee constituted by the State court of last resort or by State law, a capital litigation resource center, or a statewide defender organization to: (1) certify attorneys qualified to represent persons charged with capital offenses or sentenced to death; (2) draft and annually publish procedures and standards by which attorneys are certified and rosters of certified attorneys; and (3) periodically review the roster of certified attorneys, monitor the performance of all attorneys certified, and withdraw certification from any attorney who fails to meet high performance standards or to demonstrate continuing competence to represent prisoners in capital litigation. Authorizes the payment of fees and expenses for investigative, expert, or other services reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant. Directs the court to fix the compensation to be paid to an attorney appointed under this title. Specifies which law controls in Federal habeas corpus proceedings. Sets forth habeas corpus time requirements. Specifies that an applicant for habeas corpus in a capital case shall be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State when the applicant has exhausted any right to direct appeal in the State. Title III: Use of Firearms in Crimes of Violence and Drug Trafficking Crimes - Amends the Federal criminal code to increase mandatory minimum sentences for criminals using firearms and for other violent criminals. (Under current law, whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or any drug trafficking crime, uses or carries a firearm, in addition to the punishment provided for the underlying crime, is subject to imprisonment for five years or, if a machinegun or firearm equipped with a silencer is involved, 30 years and for subsequent offenses, 20 years or life imprisonment without release, respectively. Under this Act, such criminals would receive additional sentences of not less than ten years for possession of a firearm, 20 years for discharging a firearm with intent to injure, or 30 years for possession of a machinegun or a firearm equipped with a silencer (all without release.) Provides for enhanced penalties for third and subsequent convictions. Defines \"possession\" of a firearm to include: (1) in the case of a crime of violence, touching a firearm at the crime scene at any time during the commission of the crime; and (2) in the case of a drug trafficking crime, having a firearm readily available at the crime scene during the commission of the crime. Makes this section inapplicable to persons found to have committed criminal acts while acting in defense of person or property during the course of a crime being committed by another person. Sets forth penalties of up to ten years' imprisonment and a fine for stealing firearms and for smuggling firearms with intent to engage in or promote certain drug-related or violent offenses. Provides for mandatory revocation of supervised release for possession of a firearm. Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to increase prison sentences for selling illegal drugs to minors and for the use of minors in drug trafficking activities. Provides for life imprisonment without release for those convicted a third time of a felony drug offense. Title IV: Assault Weapons - Antidrug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1990 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer, importation, receipt, or possession of any assault weapon, except: (1) by the Federal, State, or local government; and (2) with respect to weapons lawfully possessed before enactment of this Act. Specifies firearms to be included as assault weapons. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to recommend to the Congress the addition or deletion of firearms to be designated as assault weapons. Increases the length of imprisonment for an individual who uses or carries an assault weapon during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Prohibits the sale, shipment, or delivery (or purchase, possession, or acceptance of delivery) of an assault weapon to (or by) any person who does not fill out a specified form. Establishes recordkeeping requirements.% Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the request and delivery of such form. Sets penalties for failure to acquire such form with respect to the transfer, receipt, or possession of any assault weapon. Directs the Attorney General to investigate and report to the Senate on the effect of this title on violent and drug trafficking crime. Title V: International Money Laundering - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress periodically with respect to certain reporting requirements involving currency transactions, the manner in which U.S. agencies collect and use such reports to support investigations and prosecutions, and a summary of: (1) sanctions imposed for failure to comply with reporting requirements; (2) criminal indictments which resulted from investigations initiated by analysis of such reports; and (3) information regarding suspicious financial transactions provided voluntarily by financial institutions. Directs the Secretary to appoint an Electronic Scanning Task Force to: (1) study methods of printing on U.S. currency notes in denominations of $10 or more a serial number that may be read by electronic scanning; (2) make an assessment of the cost of implementing such scanning; and (3) make recommendations about the amount of time needed for implementation. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) authorize the Attorney General to transfer forfeited personal property (or proceeds) to any foreign country which participated in the seizure or forfeiture of the property, if certain conditions are met; (2) include within the definition of \"specified unlawful activity\" with respect to money laundering, offenses under provisions relating to false statements by an employee of a financial institution and false statements in connection with loan and credit applications and to exclude offenses relating to bank fraud; and (3) modify the knowledge requirement with respect to international money laundering. Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to: (1) add conforming predicate money laundering references to the \"insider\" exemption under such Act; and (2) shield from liability any financial institution or any officer, employee, or agent of such institution for refusing to do business with any person before or after disclosures of a possible violation of law or regulation to a government authority. Title VI: Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 - Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 - Chapter 1: Drug-Related Child Abuse; Habitual Child Abuse Offense - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it a felony to commit a crime of violence against a person under age 18 if the offense was committed as part of a violation of the CSA or the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, subject to certain conditions. Requires the Attorney General to amend the United States Attorneys' Manual to reflect the intent of the Congress that Federal prosecution occur only in egregious cases of drug-related abuse and neglect. Requires the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines to provide that a defendant convicted of such an offense, who has previously been convicted on two separate occasions of a sexual offense or crime of violence in which the victim was under age 18, shall receive the maximum punishment authorized by law. Chapter 2: Improving Investigation and Prosecution of Child Abuse Cases - Requires the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to make grants to develop multidisciplinary child abuse investigation and prosecution programs. Enumerates program criteria, including requirements identifying a neutral site for counseling child victims of sexual and serious physical abuse and neglect, referring cases to such counseling center within 24 hours, minimizing the number of interviews the child victim must attend, requiring that all interviews and meetings with a child victim occur at the counseling center, designating a director for the multidisciplinary program, and assigning volunteers or staff advocates to each child's family. Requires the Administrator to make grants to provide technical assistance and training to attorneys and others instrumental to the criminal prosecution of child abuse cases in State or Federal courts. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 3: Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program - Requires the Administrator to: (1) make grants to expand the court-appointed special advocate program; and (2) establish criteria to be used in evaluating grant applications, which shall include a program providing screening, training, and supervision of court-appointed special advocates. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 4: Child Abuse Training Programs for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners - Requires the Administrator to provide technical assistance and training to judicial personnel and attorneys to improve the judicial system's handling of child abuse and neglect cases and to provide administrative reform in juvenile and family courts. Directs the Administrator to make grants to: (1) national organizations to develop model technical programs to improve the judicial system's handling of such cases; and (2) State courts or judicial administrators for programs that provide for training and technical assistance to judicial personnel and attorneys in juvenile and family courts and for administrative reform in such courts. Directs that the grant criteria give priority to programs which improve procedures for preventing placement of children in foster care, make reasonable efforts to reunite the family, and coordinate information and services. Authorizes appropriations. Requires that at least 80 percent of such funds be used for juvenile and family court and State judicial programs. Chapter 5: Federal Victims' Protections and Rights - Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow, in a proceeding involving an alleged offense against a child or involving a child witness, the attorney for the Government, the child's attorney, or the guardian ad litem to apply (at least five days before trial date) for a court order that the child's testimony be taken in a room outside the courtroom and be televised by two-way closed-circuit television (TV). Authorizes the court to order that such testimony be taken by closed-circuit TV if it finds that the child is unable to testify in open court because of: (1) the child's persistent refusal to testify despite the court's requests to do so; (2) the child's total inability to testify because of fear, failure of memory, or similar circumstances; (3) the substantial likelihood that the child will suffer emotional trauma; and (4) the child suffering a mental or other infirmity. Requires: (1) the court to support any ruling on the child's inability to testify in open court with findings on the record; and (2) expert testimony to support such a finding with respect to the child's persistent refusal to testify. Specifies that: (1) if the court orders the taking of testimony by television, the attorney for the Government and the defense attorney shall be present in the room with the child and the child shall be subject to direct cross-examination; and (2) the only other persons allowed to be present are the child's attorney or guardian ad litem, persons necessary to operate the closed-circuit equipment, and other persons whose presence is determined by the court to be necessary to the welfare and well-being of the child. Requires that: (1) the child's testimony be transmitted by closed-circuit TV into the courtroom for the defendant, jury, judge, and public; (2) the defendant be provided with the means of private, contemporaneous communication with his attorney during the testimony; and (3) the closed-circuit TV transmission relay the defendant's image into the room in which the child is testifying. Sets forth analogous provisions with respect to videotaped depositions of child victims and child witnesses. Sets forth requirements with respect to competency examinations for child witnesses. Sets forth provisions with respect to confidentiality of information involving a child in connection with a criminal proceeding.% Authorizes the court: (1) on motion by any person, to issue an order protecting a child's name or other information concerning the child in the course of the proceedings if the court determines that disclosure would be detrimental to the child; and (2) to allow disclosure to anyone to whom disclosure is necessary for the welfare and well-being of the child. Grants the child victim or witness the same right to submit victim impact statements prior to sentencing as prescribed for an adult. Directs that child victims or witnesses be assisted by their court appointed guardian ad litem in preparing victim impact statements. Encourages the use of multidisciplinary teams designed to assist child victims or child witnesses. Describes the role of such teams. Authorizes the court to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the best interests of a child who was a victim of, or a witness to, a crime involving abuse or exploitation. Sets forth guidelines with respect to criteria in choosing, and the duties of, such guardian. Grants a child testifying at or attending a judicial proceeding the right to be accompanied by an adult attendant to provide emotional support, subject to certain restrictions. Authorizes the court, in any proceeding where a child is called to give testimony, to designate the case as being of special public importance and to expedite the action. Requires the court to ensure a speedy trial and, in deciding whether or not to grant a continuance, to take into account the child's age and the potential adverse impact the delay may have on the child's well-being. Declares that there is no statute of limitations for any sex offense involving a child victim. Provides for extension of the period of limitations with respect to civil actions arising out of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim. Amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to set forth analogous provisions with respect to the rights of child victims and child witnesses in civil cases. Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to create a hearsay exception for an out-of-court statement made by a child of less than 13 years concerning acts or conduct related to alleged completed or attempted crimes of sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exploitation of such child or concerning a crime witnessed by the child that is not otherwise admissible if: (1) the child testifies at the proceeding or testifies by means of videotaped deposition or closed-circuit TV and, at the time, is subject to cross-examination about the out-of-court statement; (2) the court finds that the child's out-of-court statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness; or (3) the court finds that the child is unable to testify effectively for various reasons, such as the child's death, absence, refusal, or substantial likelihood that the child would suffer emotional trauma. Requires the proponents of the statement to inform the adverse party of the intention to offer the statement and its content sufficiently in advance of the proceeding to provide the defendant with a fair opportunity to prepare a response. Lists factors the court may consider in determining whether a statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, including the child's knowledge of the event, the age and maturity of the child, any apparent motive the child may have to falsify or distort the event, and whether extrinsic evidence exists to show the defendant's opportunity to commit the act complained of in the child's statement.
