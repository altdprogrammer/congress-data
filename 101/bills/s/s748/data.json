Increases from $500 to $1,000 the total amount that may be expended on any veteran in a 12-month period for outpatient dental services and treatment. Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to periodically review the cost of dental care to determine whether such dollar ceiling should be adjusted and to adjust such ceiling if necessary. Extends through FY 1991 the authority of the Secretary to furnish respite care services to eligible veterans. Extends through FY 1994 the authorization of appropriations for assisting States in constructing State home facilities to be used for furnishing domiciliary and nursing home care to veterans and expanding or remodeling existing State facilities."
