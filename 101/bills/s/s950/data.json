Establishes a Research and Development Center to be administered by the Commandant of the Coast Guard and to conduct research and development on and support the prevention, containment, and cleanup of oil spills by tankers in U.S. navigable waters. Makes Fund moneys available for the Center. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make available to the Secretary of Transportation such funds as considered necessary to carry out these provisions. Limits the amount of available funds. Provides that efforts to restore and enhance areas affected by oil spills shall be directed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Establishes a Coastal Zone Restoration and Enhancement Fund for areas affected by oil spills. Requires the Administrator to expend from such Fund such sums as considered necessary for the restoration and enhancement of such areas' natural resources. Requires a one cent per barrel fee to be collected on each barrel of refined petroleum refined in, or imported into, the United States for deposit in such Fund. Terminates the collection of such fee when $500,000,000 has been accumulated in the Fund."
