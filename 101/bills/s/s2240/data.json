Requires that the grants be directed to the chief elected official of the city or urban county that administers the public health agency serving the greatest number of individuals with AIDS in the eligible area. Requires that official to establish: (1) through intergovernmental agreements, an administrative mechanism to allocate funds and services; and (2) an HIV health services planning council.

Provides, at specified times, that one-half of funds appropriated for the grants be used for regular grants and one-half be used for supplemental grants. Requires that grant funds be used for: (1) outpatient and ambulatory health and support services, including case management and comprehensive treatment services; and (2) inpatient case management services that prevent unnecessary hospitalization or that expedite discharge. Requires the chief official, in providing assistance, to give priority to entities currently participating in Health Resources and Services Administration HIV health care demonstration projects. Allows, if the council finds there is a personnel shortage, up to ten percent of the grant funds to be used for recruiting, training, and paying compensation of services of personnel, for entities that provide HIV-related care or services to a disproportionate share of low-income individuals and families with HIV disease, incur uncompensated costs, and meet other requirements. Requires that services covered by Medicaid be provided by providers with Medicaid provider status. Specifies information and assurances which must be included in a grant application. Limits (in some cases prohibits) the imposition of fees for services under the grants. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: HIV Care Grants - Directs the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to make grants to States to improve the quality, availability, and organization of health care and support services for individuals and families with HIV disease. Allows the grants to be used: (1) to establish and operate HIV care consortia within areas most affected by HIV disease to provide a comprehensive continuum of care; (2) to provide home- and community-based care services; (3) to provide assistance to assure the continuity of health insurance coverage; and (4) to provide treatments that have been determined to prolong life or prevent serious deterioration of health. Requires that at least 15 percent of the funds be used for health and support services to infants, children, women, and families with HIV disease. Details, for each of the four categories of grants, the uses of funds, the assurances and information required in the application, and certain priorities. Limits (in some cases prohibits) the imposition of fees for services under the grants. Requires non-Federal matching funds in specified ratios. Directs the Secretary to use up to ten percent of specified amounts to establish and administer a special projects of national significance program, awarding grants based on the need to assess the effectiveness of a particular care and treatment model, the innovative nature of the activity, and the potential replicability of the activity.

Title III: Early Intervention Services - Directs the Secretary, through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, to make an allotment for each State each fiscal year to provide, with respect to HIV disease, the following outpatient early intervention services: (1) counseling individuals; (2) testing individuals, including tests to confirm the presence of the disease, to diagnose the extent of the deficiency in the immune system, to provide information on therapeutic measures for preventing and treating the deterioration of the immune system and for preventing and treating conditions arising from the disease; (3) referrals; (4) other clinical and diagnostic services, and periodic medical evaluations; and (5) therapeutic measures.

Requires a State grant recipient to: (1) encourage individuals in the State receiving a transfusion of whole blood or a blood-clotting factor between January 1, 1978, and April 1, 1985, to receive early intervention services; and (2) inform such individuals of public health facilities in the geographic area that provide such services. Declares that these requirements do not mandate individual notifications. Requires that a State grant recipient mandate that any entity carrying out testing for HIV disease confidentially report to the State public health officer information sufficient to: (1) perform statistical and epidemiological analyses of the incidence of the disease; (2) perform statistical and epidemiological analyses of the demographic characteristics of individuals with the disease; and (3) assess the adequacy of early intervention services. Requires a State grant recipient to require that the State public health officer, to the extent appropriate in the determination of the officer, carry out a program of partner notification with respect to cases of HIV disease. Declares that these reporting and partner notification provisions do not require or prohibit a State from providing that identifying information concerning individuals with HIV disease is required to be submitted to the State. Prohibits a grant to a State unless its chief executive officer determines that the criminal laws of the State are adequate to prosecute any HIV infected individual who knowingly and intentionally exposes a nonconsenting individual to HIV through a donation of blood, semen, or breast milk, through sexual activity, or through sharing of a hypodermic needle. Makes the existence of a criminal law of general application, which can be applied to such conduct, sufficient for compliance. Sets forth a formula for determination of the amounts of allotments.

Requires counseling before testing and, for both individuals with negative and individuals with positive results, after testing. Allows counseling without testing. Requires that testing by grant recipients be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this Act regarding confidentiality, informed consent, and counseling regardless of whether the testing is carried out with Federal funds. Requires that, to the extent permitted under State law, grant recipients offer substantial opportunities for an individual to undergo counseling and testing without giving any identifying information or using a pseudonym. Prohibits requiring an individual to undergo testing as a condition to receiving other health services unless the testing is medically indicated in the provision of the health services sought by an individual.
