    "text": "Automobile Fuel Economy Act of 1989 - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to increase the corporate average fuel economy standard by increments from 27.5 miles per gallon in model year 1989 to 34 miles per gallon in model year 1996. Sets forth (anti-backsliding) penalties for any manufacturer which fails to achieve for any model year beginning on 1991 an average fuel economy at least equal to that in at least one of the two preceding model years. Raises the civil penalty for noncompliance with average fuel economy standards from $5 per tenth mile to $10 per tenth mile. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to double the otherwise applicable penalty for any manufacturer which exhibits a pattern of noncompliance, beginning with model year 1990. Directs the Secretaries of Transportation and of Energy to report to the Congress on the availability of existing fuel-saving technologies and the potential for developing such technologies by the year 2000 for light duty passenger vehicles. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to report to the Congress on the accuracy and reliability of its fuel economy testing procedures."
