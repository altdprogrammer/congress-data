    "text": "Clean Air Act Amendments of 1989 - Title I: Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards - Amends the Clean Air Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after promulgating a new or revised national ambient air quality standard, to require States to submit air quality implementation plans. Requires State Governors to designate areas within a State as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable, with regard to air quality standards, and to submit such designations to the Administrator. Authorizes the Administrator to modify such designations, as necessary. Designates areas currently required to be listed under the Clean Air Act as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable areas, as specified. Provides for the redesignation of areas, as appropriate. Prohibits the redesignation of any area from nonattainment to unclassifiable. Directs State Governors to submit to the Administrator a list of areas designated or redesignated as carbon monoxide and ozone attainment, nonattainment, and unclassifiable areas. Designates: (1) areas identified (in 52 Federal Register 29383) as Group I areas as particulate matter 10 (PM-10) nonattainment areas; (2) counties containing sites for which air quality monitoring data show a violation of national air quality standards for PM-10 before 1989 as PM-10 nonattainment areas; and (3) areas not meeting either description as PM-10 unclassifiable areas. Authorizes the Administrator to require States to designate areas with respect to the national air quality standard for lead. Permits the Administrator, with respect to attainment or unclassifiable areas, to require States to submit implementation plans that provide for the maintenance of such standards. Makes technical amendments to provisions concerning plan requirements. Sets forth provisions for plan approval and revisions. Requires plans to provide for attainment of national air quality standards in nonattainment areas within three years of this Act's enactment or within five years of a finding of substantial inadequacy. Retains a moratorium on construction or modification of major stationary sources in certain areas until such areas meet applicable requirements concerning permit programs or attainment standards for sulfur oxides. Repeals provisions concerning: (1) extensions of time for plan submissions and attainment dates; (2) requirements concerning parking surcharges and transportation regulations; and (3) suspensions of certain plan requirements. Requires the Administrator to publish a triennial (currently, annual) document which sets forth applicable requirements of the implementation plan for each State. Revises provisions concerning stack heights to require such heights to equal the height prescribed by the Administrator (currently, the height shall not exceed two and a half times the height of the source), unless the owner or operator demonstrates the need for the greater height and such source has met applicable emissions standards. Sets the date of attainment of national air quality standards for a nonattainment area at five years from the date such area was designated. Authorizes the Administrator to extend such attainment date, provided that such extension does not exceed 20 years and that no more than two extensions are granted to a single area. Requires States to submit nonattainment plans within three years of the designation of an area. Makes technical amendments to provisions concerning nonattainment plan requirements. Authorizes the issuance of a permit to construct or operate a new source if demonstrated that the benefits of such source significantly outweigh environmental and social costs. Prohibits the use of existing growth allowances in areas which are notified that implementation plans containing such allowances are substantially inadequate. Requires States containing ozone or carbon monoxide nonattainment areas, together with local officials of such areas, to review and update, as necessary, planning procedures for such areas. Authorizes States, in the case of areas included in more than one State, to implement jointly such planning procedures. Provides that maintenance plans required as preconditions to area redesignations shall provide for maintenance of air quality standards for at least ten years after a redesignation petition is submitted to the Administrator. Authorizes the Administrator, whenever it is determined that the interstate transport of air pollutants from one or more States contributes significantly to a violation of an air quality standard in such States, to establish a transport region for such pollutants within such States. Requires the Administrator to establish a transport commission for each such region to: (1) assess the degree of interstate transport of the pollutant or precursors to the pollutant throughout the transport region; (2) assess strategies for mitigating the interstate pollution; and (3) recommend to the Administrator such measures as may be necessary to ensure that State plans meet requirements of this Act. Permits such commissions to request the Administrator to issue a finding that one or more of the States in a transport region have inadequate implementation plans. Applies program cost limitations for interstate air quality agencies to such commissions. Imposes the following sanctions on States which fail to comply with requirements concerning nonattainment areas: (1) a moratorium on the construction or modification of any major stationary source of the relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area, or with respect to ozone, the nonattainment area and the area within 25 miles of the nonattainment area; (2) restrictions on Department of Transportation assistance to such areas; (3) restrictions on the provision of new drinking water service in such areas; or (4) a withholding of all or part of assistance for air pollution planning and control. Requires States which fail to attain air quality standards by the required attainment date to submit plan revisions. Prohibits the construction or modification of any major stationary source of a pollutant in a nonattainment area after 1992 or 42 months after the designation of such area, whichever is later, unless the Administrator has approved a plan submission for such area. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate a Federal implementation plan if any State fails to make a required submission or such submission is not approved. Classifies ozone nonattainment areas as Marginal, Moderate, Serious, and Severe, based upon the amount by which the air quality standard is exceeded in the area. Authorizes the Administrator to adjust the classification of areas which would be classified in another area if the ozone level were five percent greater or less. Prohibits more than two one-year attainment extensions from being issued for a single nonattainment area. Sets forth the following attainment dates: (1) December 31, 1995, for Marginal and Moderate areas; (2) December 31, 2000, for Serious areas; and (3) December 31, 2010, for Severe areas. Provides for the reclassification of areas which fail to meet required standards. Requires States in which Marginal areas are located to submit to the Administrator a current inventory of actual emissions from all sources. Directs such States to submit plan revisions to require: (1) correction requirements for available control technology; (2) a vehicle inspection and maintenance program; (3) permits for the construction and operation of new or modified stationary sources; (4) triennial inventories; and (5) emissions statements from owners or operators of stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen or volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Waives requirements for the submission of triennial inventories for sources which emit less than 25 tons annually of nitrogen oxides or VOCs if the State provides an emissions inventory for such sources to the Administrator. Requires States in which Moderate areas are located to submit plan revisions which provide for emission reductions, by December 31, 1995, of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions. Prohibits the following measures from being credited to the 15 percent reduction: (1) measures relating to motor vehicle tailpipe or evaporative emissions promulgated by the Administrator; (2) regulations concerning Reid Vapor Pressure promulgated by the Administrator; (3) measures concerning required corrections to implementation plans; and (4) measures concerning motor vehicle inspection and maintenance. Provides that plan revisions shall require: (1) the implementation of reasonably available control technology with respect to all VOC sources covered by a Control Techniques Guideline document and all sources with the potential to emit at least 100 tons annually of VOCs; and (2) owners and operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate systems for gasoline vapor recovery of emissions from the fueling of motor vehicles. Sets forth deadlines for the installation of such systems. Requires States in which Serious areas are located to submit the same plan revisions as those applicable to Moderate areas. Directs such States, by December 31, 1995, to submit revisions to provide for: (1) the attainment of the ozone air quality standard by the applicable attainment date; and (2) certain VOC emissions reductions from the baseline emissions averaged over three-year periods, beginning in 1996. Sets forth provisions concerning creditable emissions reductions. Permits such revisions to provide for combined VOC and nitrogen oxide emissions reductions (in lieu of sole VOC reductions) that would result in reductions equivalent to those required for VOC emissions from the baseline level. Requires such States to revise plans to provide for programs to reduce hydrocarbon emissions from in-use motor vehicles in urbanized nonattainment areas with populations over 200,000. Sets forth minimum requirements for such programs, including waiver and enforcement provisions. Requires States containing certain Serious or Severe areas with populations over 250,000 to submit plan revisions to ensure the implementation of clean-fuel vehicle programs, including measures to make the use of clean alternative fuels economical for owners. Permits the Administrator to approve substitutes for such programs if such substitutes will achieve equivalent reductions of ozone-producing emissions. Requires States with Serious areas in which the levels of vehicle miles traveled or congestion levels exceed levels projected for purposes of the area's demonstration of attainment or progress to submit plan revisions providing for transportation control measures. Requires States in which Severe areas are located to make the same submissions as those applicable to Serious areas and to submit an attainment demonstration by December 31, 2000. Provides that States containing non-self-generating ozone nonattainment areas that do not include or are not adjacent to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of this Act if they make submissions required for Marginal areas. Permits the Administrator to treat such areas as non-self-generating if found that VOC and nitrogen oxides emissions within such areas do not contribute significantly to ozone concentrations in such areas or other areas. Sets forth requirements for areas reclassified as Moderate. Requires the Administrator to: (1) issue control techniques guidelines for seven categories of stationary sources of VOC emissions for which guidelines have not been issued; and (2) issue a document analyzing alternative control techniques for stationary sources of nitrogen oxides. Directs the Administrator to: (1) report to the Congress on VOC emissions from consumer or commercial products; and (2) promulgate regulations to aid in the attainment of the ozone air quality standard by decreasing emissions from such products. Authorizes such regulations to exempt health use products for which there are no suitable substitutes. Permits the transfer of enforcement authority for such regulations to States with the approval of the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to promulgate standards applicable to air pollutant emissions from loading and unloading marine tank vessels which may endanger public health or welfare. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue regulations to ensure the safety of the equipment and operations to control such emissions. Prohibits States from adopting any less stringent emissions standards. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on whether current methodology used to establish a design value for ozone provides a reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. Subjects such study to peer review. Establishes an ozone transport region comprised of coastal States on the east coast between Maine and Maryland and the consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) including the District of Columbia. Sets a fee of $5,000 per ton of VOC emitted during a calendar year in excess of 80 percent of the baseline amount for major stationary sources in areas which fail to attain standards by the applicable date. Requires such fee to be adjusted annually. Exempts from such fee areas with populations under 200,000 if demonstrated that attainment is prevented because of ozone transported from other areas. Classifies carbon monoxide nonattainment areas as Moderate or Serious. Authorizes the Administrator to adjust such classifications under conditions parallel to those for ozone nonattainment areas. Sets forth attainment dates of December 31, 1995, and December 31, 2000, for Moderate and Serious areas, respectively. Sets forth provisions for attainment extensions and reclassifications parallel to those for ozone nonattainment areas. Requires States in which Moderate carbon monoxide areas are located to submit to the Administrator a current inventory of actual emissions from all sources. Directs such States to submit plan revisions to require: (1) vehicle inspection and maintenance programs; and (2) triennial inventories. Requires States in which Serious carbon monoxide areas are located to make the same submissions as those required for Moderate areas. Directs such States to submit plan revisions to require: (1) attainment demonstrations; (2) vehicle inspection and maintenance programs; (3) transportation control measures; and (4) the use of oxygenated fuels in CMSAs or MSAs. Classifies PM-10 nonattainment areas as Moderate or Serious. Sets forth procedures and a timetable for reclassification of such areas. Provides for attainment dates of December 31, 1994, and December 31, 2001, for Moderate and Serious areas, respectively. Sets forth provisions for attainment extensions parallel to those for ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas. Permits additional extensions to be granted to Serious areas, under specified conditions. Limits such extensions to a period of five years. Authorizes the Administrator to waive any requirement or attainment date for a Serious PM-10 area if determined that anthropogenic sources of PM-10 do not contribute significantly to violations of the PM-10 standard in such area. Requires States in which Moderate PM-10 areas are located to submit plans that include a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified PM-10 sources and a demonstration on whether attainment is practicable by the applicable date.
