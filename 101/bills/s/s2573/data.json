Amends the Fair Trade in Auto Parts Act of 1988 to require the Secretary of Commerce to submit biannual reports to the Congress concerning increases in the sale of U.S. auto parts and accessories in Japanese markets. Directs the Attorney General and the International Trade Commission to study and report to the Congress on the pattern of procurement of such items by foreign automobile manufacturers operating in the United States to determine if there may be unfair methods of competition in connection with such procurement."
