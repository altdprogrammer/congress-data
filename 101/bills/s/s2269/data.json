Requires the Director to establish a personnel management system for the Office: (1) which provides for the appointment, pay, promotion, and assignment of all employees based on merit; and (2) to which Federal provisions governing appointments and other personnel actions in competitive civil service, and relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates, shall not apply. Requires that such system, at a minimum: (1) provide for a schedule of pay rates applicable to all employees; (2) provide that the basic rate of pay not exceed that under level V of the Executive Schedule, with exceptions; (3) incorporate pay comparability principles; (4) provide for pay adjustments as provided for General Schedule and prevailing rate employees; (5) establish procedures for employee evaluations, the granting of periodic pay adjustments, incentive awards, and resolution of employee grievances; (6) establish procedures for disciplinary actions; (7) establish procedures for premium pay; (8) include merit system principles; (9) prohibit personnel practices prohibited under Federal law; (10) prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, political affiliation, marital status, or handicapping condition; and (11) provide for the basic rate of pay of not more than five percent of the authorized positions of the Office, with exceptions, to be set at rates not to exceed the rate of basic pay for positions at level IV of the Executive Schedule. Authorizes the Director to implement flexible and compressed work schedules and to exempt the hours constituting such schedules from premium pay to the extent necessary to implement such schedules. Requires the Director to promulgate regulations providing procedures for resolving complaints of discrimination by employees and applicants. Limits the aggregate pay in any one-year period of any individual whose basic rate of pay is set under this Act to the annual aggregate amount computed at the basic rate of pay for the position of the Director.

Authorizes the Chief Justice of the United States or the Judicial Conference of the United States to grant incentive awards to the Director, subject to certain limitations. Authorizes the Director to develop and conduct programs to meet agency training needs. Continues the right of specified employees to file appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Includes the Office, the Federal Judicial Center, and specified courts within the scope of civil service severance pay provisions. Applies back pay provisions to the Center and specified courts.
