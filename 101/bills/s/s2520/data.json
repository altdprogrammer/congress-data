Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, through the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, to: (1) award grants to States to establish drug treatment programs in State prisons; and (2) award grants to States to establish drug treatment programs for juvenile criminal offenders. Requires a State, as part of its application for such grant, to submit plans for establishing such programs. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to enable plan preparation. Allows the Director to award a grant under these provisions to a State without an application and plan if the State has begun implementing a plan for demonstration prison or juvenile criminal offenders drug treatment programs under specified provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth criteria for treatment programs supported by grants under this Act. Prohibits the Attorney General and the appropriate State law enforcement official from permitting the early release of inmates convicted of drug offenses unless the inmates have successfully completed a program of treatment or after care under this Act. Sets forth early release requirements."
