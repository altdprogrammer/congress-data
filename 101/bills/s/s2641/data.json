    "text": "Medigap Simplification Act of 1990 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require that Medicare supplemental policy issuers: (1) cover a core group of basic benefits and, if they offer other benefits, issue a policy covering only such basic benefits; and (2) provide prospective purchasers of a policy with a summary information sheet describing policy benefits and the amount of any premiums attributable to optional benefits. Requires the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or, upon the NAIC's default, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate simplification standards which set the core group of basic benefits policies must provide, limit the additional benefit packages that may be provided, and establish a uniform language and format to be used with respect to policy benefits. Prohibits the sale of policies which do not meet such standards, though permits approved waivers of such standards to test new or innovative benefits. Directs the NAIC to educate Medicare beneficiaries on the simplification standards. Prohibits a policy issuer from selling a policy without: (1) obtaining a written statement of the buyer indicating any Medicare supplemental policies or Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) coverage the buyer may have; and (2) notifying the buyer of the possibility and effect of his or her coverage under the Medicaid program and the address and telephone number of any State Medicare supplemental policy counseling program and the State Medicaid office. Prohibits the issuer from selling a policy to a person who indicates that he or she is eligible for Medicaid coverage which would duplicate coverage under such policy. Penalizes individuals who sell a policy in violation of such requirements. Directs the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the use of Medicare supplemental policies by individuals who are entitled to Medicaid benefits. Authorizes appropriations for a grant program to assist States in establishing toll-free consumer hotlines providing information on Medicare supplemental policies issued in States and Medicare and Medicaid benefits available to Medicare-eligible individuals."
