Increases the permissible maximum deficit amounts for FY 1990 through 1992. Establishes allowable maximum deficits for FY 1993 and 1995, to reach zero with respect to FY 1996. Amends the Social Security Act to make it out of order in the Congress to consider legislation that would increase outlays for old-age, survivors and disability insurance benefits that would not be offset or financed by an increase in revenues or savings to the social security trust funds."
