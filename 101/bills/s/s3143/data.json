    "text": "Disaster Assistance Act of 1990 - Extends assistance under this Act only to producers in a county substantially affected during the 1988, 1989, and 1990 crop years by a natural disaster or by a major disaster or emergency. Title I: Annual Crops - Extends disaster crop loss assistance through the 1990 crop year for wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, soybeans, and other nonprogram crops. Extends crop quality reduction disaster assistance through the 1990 crop year. Reduces disaster assistance payments in relation to Federal crop insurance payments. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to announce within a specified time the conditions for establishing a 1990 farm yield for forage-use-crops. Limits to $100,000 assistance received under this Act or in combination with emergency livestock assistance under the Agricultural Act of 1949. Authorizes the substitution of crop insurance program yields for assigned farm yields for 1990 disaster assistance eligibility purposes. Title II: Orchards - Extends disaster assistance (up to $25,000 or an equivalent value in seedlings) to commercial orchardists who suffered 1990 weather-caused tree losses in excess of 45 percent. Title III: Forest Crops - Extends disaster assistance (up to $25,000 or an equivalent value in seedlings) to commercial tree farmers who suffered 1990 weather-caused losses in excess of 45 percent. Title IV: Additional Assistance - Prohibits the Secretary from reducing rental payments to an owner or operator who hays or grazes livestock during the 1990 crop year on land subject to a conservation reserve program contract to the extent that such owner or operator carries out and pays for specified additional conservation practices. Title V: Administrative Provisions - Requires assistance applications to be made by April 30, 1991, or such later date as the Secretary may prescribe. Title VI: Advance Deficiency Payments - Directs the Secretary, with regard to advance deficiency payments paid in 1988 or 1989 to producers who suffered 1988 through 1990 losses in disaster-affected counties, to permit a three-year repayment of such amounts."
