    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1989-07-26", 
    "text": "Former Presidents Act of 1989 - Title I: Former Presidents - Changes the amount of the annual allowance to which the surviving spouse of a deceased former President is entitled from $20,000 to two-thirds of the allowance to which a former President is entitled. Repeals the requirement that a widow of a former President must waive the right to any other Government annuity or pension to qualify for such allowance. Authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration to provide to each former President upon request: (1) one office, not exceeding a certain area in size, in a public building and appropriate equipment for such office; (2) compensation for office staff members, without an aggregate ceiling, who shall be subject to certain provisions of civil service laws; (3) payment for the travel and subsistence allowances for certain employees; (4) transportation on aircraft owned or chartered by the Government solely to enable the President to conclude his or her official duties and otherwise as required incidentally to protect such former President; (5) communication services; (6) printing and binding expenses; and (7) moving the former President and the presidential family and their possessions from the White House to a location in the United States. Allows any Federal employee to be detailed to the office staff of a former President with the consent of the employee's agency head. Declares that the costs of providing transportation to a former President on aircraft owned or chartered by the Government shall be paid from appropriations for such purpose. Authorizes the Administrator to provide a former Vice President with necessary services and facilities for concluding his or her office affairs which are similar to the services and facilities provided to a former President under this title. Prohibits the use of funds provided for necessary services and facilities of a former President or Vice President for partisan political activities or income generating activities. Prohibits the expenditure of such funds for a former President or Vice President any time beyond 90 days after the former President dies. Requires each former President to report annually to the Congress concerning activities carried out with such funds. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this title concerning the services and facilities to be provided for former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Revises provisions authorizing appropriations to the Administrator with respect to presidential transitions to provide that not more than $2,000,000 may be appropriated for providing services and facilities to the President-elect and the Vice President-elect. Title II: Protection of Former Presidents and Former Vice Presidents - Prohibits the United States Secret Service from protecting a former President or the spouse or child of a former President, except as authorized under this title. Authorizes the Secret Service to protect: (1) a former President for five years after the individual becomes a former President; (2) the spouse and child of a former President for two years after the individual becomes a former President and after two years to the extent that such protection is incidental to the protection of the former President; (3) the spouse and child of a deceased former President for whichever is the greater period of six months after the former President dies or the time remaining in the two-year period, if the President died before the expiration of the two-year period; and (4) the spouse and child of a deceased former President for six months after the former President dies, if such death occurs after the expiration of the two-year period. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to extend or reinstate Secret Service protection of a former President for one or more one-year periods and of a spouse or child for one or more six-month periods after the original protection has been terminated upon finding that a threat warranting such protection exists. Declares that no extension or reinstatement of Secret Service protection shall become effective unless the Secretary submits a notice to the Congress specifying such finding and 60 days of continuous session have expired after the date of such notice. Allows a former President or the spouse or a child of a former President to request the Secretary to extend or reinstate such protection. Requires the Secretary to notify the Congress of a denial of such a request. Authorizes the President to direct the Secret Service to protect a former President or the spouse or child of a former President if a threat warrants emergency action. Requires the President to notify the Congress of any such action. Permits the Secretary to authorize Secret Service protection for a former Vice President for a period beginning on the last day of the individual's term and ending on the last day of the fiscal year in which the term expires, and upon finding that a threat exists which warrants such protection."
