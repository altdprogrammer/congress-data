    "text": "Title I: Maritime Transportation of United States Mail - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to require the Postal Service to contract with U.S. registered vessels for international sea transportation of mail. Requires rate charges for such transportation to comply with the Shipping Act of 1984. Authorizes competitive bidding for such contracts and limits such contracts to a one year duration. Prohibits the Postal Service from contracting with vessels on the basis of cargo container size, unless necessary. Title II: National Merchant Marine Policy Council Findings - Declares that the Congress reaffirms the declaration of policy set forth in the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 that it is necessary for the national defense and development of commerce that the United States have a merchant marine meeting specified criteria. Establishes as an independent entity in the executive branch a National Merchant Marine Policy Council to be the principal coordinating body for policies, programs, and issues relating to merchant marine matters involving Federal departments, agencies, or other entities. Requires the Council to have an Executive Committee and two Policy Committees: (1) the Merchant Marine Promotion Committee; and (2) the Merchant Marine Regulatory Policy Committee. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for FY 1989 and 1990."
