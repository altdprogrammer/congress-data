    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1990-10-01", 
    "text": "Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to: (1) revise the definition of \"mature contract\" to provide that the right of a tribal organization or the tribal organization's Indian tribe to request that its contract be considered mature applies to all contracts which meet such definition, regardless of when such contracts became effective; (2) revise the definition of \"self-determination contract\" to include grants and cooperative agreements utilized in lieu of a self-determination contract when mutually agreed by the appropriate Secretary and the tribal organization involved; (3) provide for exceptions to the requirement that tribes return unexpended or unused funds to the Treasury; and (4) make the Secretary of the agency through which funds were appropriated responsible for returning unused funds to the Treasury. Amends the Indian Self-Determination Act to: (1) revise provisions authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to contract with, or make grants to, tribal organizations for the acquisition of land within \"reservation boundaries\" to permit the acquisition of land within \"Indian country\" which includes dependent Indian communities and Indian allotments in addition to land within reservation boundaries; (2) make the Federal Torts Claims Act applicable to the operation of emergency motor vehicles in the administration of Federal medical programs by tribal contractors; (3) allow a mature self-determination contract to be for either a definite term or an indefinite term as requested by a tribe or tribal organization; (4) provide a mechanism for tribes to exercise calendar year contracting rights after FY 1990 and to require the Secretary to report to the Congress on or before April 1 of each fiscal year beginning in 1992 on additional funding needed for contract conversions effected after FY 1989; (5) apply to real property provisions regarding the acquisition and donation of excess or surplus Government personal property to an Indian tribe or tribal organization by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and (6) permit Indian tribes and tribal organizations to participate in revising and amending rules and regulations promulgated to implement the Indian Self-Determination Act. Amends the Indian Land Consolidation Act to provide that an undivided interest held by a member or nonmember Indian in any tract of trust land or restricted land within a tribe's reservation or outside of the reservation but subject to such tribe's jurisdiction shall escheat to the reservation's recognized tribal government or, if outside the reservation, to the tribal government with jurisdiction. Revises Federal Indian law which expanded the Quinault Indian Reservation to include specified lands within the Olympic National Forest in Washington to provide that boundary descriptions of the Reservation are contained in both the map and its attachments. Revises Federal law which allowed Indian owners of land held in trust or restricted status by the United States to mortgage such land with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior to subject such land to the foreclosure laws of the tribe which owns the land. Amends the Education Amendments of 1978 to provide a new factor for inclusion in the Bureau of Indian Affairs weighted student unit formula for Indian students enrolled in vocational educational programs. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide that funds for Native Hawaiian health scholarships may be provided to the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate by means other than a contract."
