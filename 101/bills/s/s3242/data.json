    "text": "Community Relations Act - States that the purposes of this Act are to: (1) provide resources to foster and maintain multicultural coalitions in communities experiencing cross-group conflict on a long-term basis; (2) fund model projects to address community based tension by bringing people from different groups together to work on specific projects of concern to the local population; (3) provide Federal resources to local communities to enable them to develop approaches to reduce community based tensions; (4) establish a mechanism through which representatives of communities can share experiences and innovative ideas across projects and disseminate successful approaches to other communities; and (5) provide technical support to programs after Federal funding has ended in order to foster ongoing coalitions which could address new community problems when they occur. Designates the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice as responsible for carrying out this Act. Requires the Service to: (1) seek technical assistance from individuals, agencies, and organizations experienced in training, maintaining, and supporting coalitions; (2) contract with such individuals, agencies, or organizations as necessary to assure that the purposes of the Act are carried out; (3) make such technical assistance available to local offices of the Service; and (4) provide technical assistance and training to projects funded under this Act. Directs the Service to make grants to coalitions for the establishment of Service projects in accordance with this Act. Requires the national office of the Service to consider the recommendations of a national board before approving a project. Sets forth the responsibilities of the Service, including: (1) disseminating information on the availability of project grants to communities which have experienced community based tension in the recent past; (2) providing technical assistance to local agencies, organizations, and individuals to develop coalitions; (3) providing assistance to coalitions in developing proposals to address such tensions; and (4) making grants for projects. Establishes criteria for eligibility for grants. Requires: (1) a coalition established under this Act to develop a plan for a community relations service project which addresses a need defined by the community and which fits within specified priorities (such as projects to deal with drugs, youth recreation, community recreation on the arts, citizenship participation, and community safety or development); and (2) coalition members to agree on project goals and define issues to be addressed. Sets forth additional requirements. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) Federal and local matching funds; (2) program administration; and (3) funding for a study of the root causes of other kinds of conflict among groups and proposed model solutions. Requires the national office of the Service to establish a national advisory board to assist in setting program goals and in evaluating proposals and the program. Requires the Service to: (1) evaluate projects funded and make recommendations on replication of successful projects; and (2) submit to the Congress and the President an evaluation of the program, including a proposal for its expansion, continuation, or termination. Authorizes appropriations. Limits the number and amounts of grants for any fiscal year."
