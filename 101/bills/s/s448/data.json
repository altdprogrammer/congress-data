Revises the visa preference system for such immigrants. Establishes a Select Review Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to review the impact of this Act and report its conclusions to the President and the Congress. Terminates the Commission on the due date of the report, but allows it to function through FY 1993 to wrap up its activities. Provides a temporary stay of deportation and work authorization for qualified spouses and children of legalized aliens. Waives the English language naturalization requirement for persons over age 65 who have resided as permanent residents in the United States for at least ten years. Shortens the usual period of lawful permanent residence for naturalization. Waives certain naturalization requirements for Philippine natives who served honorably in the U.S. armed forces during World War II."
