    "text": "Veterans' Programs Improvement Act of 1990 - Provides that in order to continue to receive payments of pension, compensation, or emergency officers' retirement pay after being rated incompetent, a veteran receiving Government hospital treatment or domiciliary care may not have an estate the value of which exceeds $4,500 (currently, $1,500). Increases from 30 to 40 years the period in which leukemia must become manifest in a veteran who engaged in a radiation-risk activity during active service in order to be considered service-connected for purposes of veterans' disability compensation provisions. Increases from three to 12 months the period during which a veteran having neither spouse nor child and being furnished domiciliary care by the Department of Veterans Affairs will be paid a monthly pension by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Requires that any amount of pension being withheld from a veteran due to the provision of domiciliary or nursing home care by the Department shall be paid in a lump sum after the veteran's discharge or release. Limits such payment to $10,000. Allows such payment to be made prior to discharge in order to facilitate placement of such veterans outside the institution."
