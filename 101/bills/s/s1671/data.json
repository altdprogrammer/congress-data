Authorizes grants for State-administered family planning programs, including natural family planning methods, infertility services, services for adolescents, and adoption services. Authorizes appropriations for State programs for FY 1990 through 1992. Sets forth allotment and reallotment formulas. Retains current Federal family planning program requirements, including the prohibition on funding programs where abortion is a method of family planning, the priority that funds be used for family planning services to low-income families, and the requirement that acceptance of services be voluntary. Prohibits State use of funds for inpatient services and land purchases. Limits administrative expenses to ten percent. Sets forth State application requirements, prohibiting Federal prescription of the manner of compliance with such requirements. Requires annual State reports on activities, prohibiting unreasonable requirements by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for information not readily available to the State."
