    "text": "Federal Rural Tourism and Recreational Development Initiative Act of 1990 - Declares it a national goal to improve and provide safe access to public lands to encourage the development of travel and tourism opportunities in support of rural area development. Authorizes the use of funds under the Federal lands highways program for purposes such as: (1) transportation planning for tourism and recreational travel; (2) interpretive signage and development of public road facilities for areas of historical, archeological, cultural, and scenic interests; (3) construction and reconstruction of roadside rest areas; and (4) other appropriate facilities as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. Specifies that funds available for forest development roads and trails may be made available for such purposes, as well. Requires the Secretary to authorize Federal aid highway projects for pedestrian and bicycle facilities to encourage alternative modes of transportation for tourism and recreational purposes. Authorizes the motorized use of trails and walkways, subject to State and local regulations. (Under current law, motorized vehicles are prohibited except for maintenance purposes and, when snow conditions and State or local regulations permit, snowmobiles.) Directs the Secretary to: (1) annually allocate sums authorized to be appropriated for access highways to public recreation areas on certain lakes; and (2) establish and carry out a tourism and recreational travel technical assistance program in non-urbanized areas. Requires that each State using funds provided in this Act have a multipurpose land use statewide driving and recreation travel plan. Authorizes appropriations."
