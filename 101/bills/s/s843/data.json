Sets each such award at $7,500 per year. Limits each individual to two such awards, but allows a third award for education courses for teaching certification. Requires recipients to serve as teachers for two years for each award received, within six years after graduation. Requires repayment for failure to complete such service obligation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1993."
