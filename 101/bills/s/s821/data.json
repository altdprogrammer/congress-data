Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to repeal the annual adjustment in congressional pay that is based on annual adjustments under the General Schedule. Requires each congressional committee with appropriate jurisdiction to review the rates of pay of Members of Congress, Federal officials, and judges and to report a bill to the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, to authorize any adjustment in the pay rates of such positions. Requires a recorded vote on such authorization bills. Declares that bills which increase the rate of pay of Members shall not be effective earlier than the beginning of the next Congress. Changes the permanent appropriation of funds for Members to provide that such appropriation will be effective at the beginning of the next Congress, when it provides for an increase in Member pay."
