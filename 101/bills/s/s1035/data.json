    "text": "Stratospheric Ozone Layer Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations prohibiting the installation, maintenance, and repair of motor vehicle air conditioners after 1990, unless equipment certified as meeting standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers for the extraction and reclamation of refrigerants is used. Requires service entities to document the number of air conditioners serviced and the amount of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) purchased and sold by such entities. Prohibits, after FY 1989, the sale of a CFC coolant in containers containing less than 15 pounds of such coolant if such container does not have a warning label indicating the danger such coolant poses to the stratospheric ozone layer. Prohibits, after 1990, the sale of any CFC coolant for use in a motor vehicle air conditioner: (1) other than for commercial or industrial use; and (2) in a container containing less than 15 pounds of such coolant. Prohibits the sale in, or export from, the United States of any motor vehicle manufactured after model year 1992 which contains an air conditioner using CFCs. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on the use of ozone-depleting chemicals, substitutes for such chemicals, and opportunities for recycling and recovery of such chemicals. Directs the Administrator, no later than January 15, 1991, to study and report to the Congress on ways to accomplish the systematic retrieval, storage, and reuse of CFCs from refrigerators, air conditioners, and motor vehicles facing immediate disposal. Directs the Administrator, no later than January 15, 1992, to study and report to the Congress on current information concerning ozone depletion and the development of motor vehicles which employ air conditioners using refrigerants other than CFCs. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to consult with motor vehicle dealers and other appropriate business entities to publicize this Act."
