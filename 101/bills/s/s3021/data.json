    "text": "National Voter Registration Enhancement Act of 1990 - Title I: Voter Registration Enhancement - Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General for block grants to States to enhance voter registration for elections for Federal office by providing for: (1) registration at State departments of motor vehicles; (2) registration by mail; (3) registration at State-related and Federal and appropriate private-sector locations; and (4) programs to ensure that official voter registration lists are accurate and current. Requires States to match Federal funds dollar for dollar to qualify for block grants. Directs the Attorney General to establish: (1) criteria for allocation of grants among States; and (2) administrative requirements for States to meet to be eligible for block grants. Directs the Attorney General, in promulgating criteria for such an allocation, to give special consideration to State-sponsored programs designed to improve registration in counties with voter registration percentages significantly lower than that for the State as a whole. Outlines provisions regarding State certifications to receive block grants. Makes the chief election official of each State responsible for coordination of State functions under this title. Makes the Attorney General responsible for coordination of Federal functions under this Act. Directs the Attorney General to provide information to States with respect to State responsibilities under this Act and to periodically report to the Congress on the impact of this Act on the administration of elections for Federal office, with recommendations for improvements in Federal and State procedures, forms, and other matters affected by this Act. Title II: Public Corruption - Amends the Federal criminal code to prescribe criminal penalties to be imposed against anyone who uses any facility of, or affects, interstate or foreign commerce to defraud the inhabitants of the United States, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or Indian country of: (1) the honest services of a government official or employee; or (2) a fair and impartially conducted election process through the use of fraudulent ballots or voter registration forms or the filing of fraudulent campaign reports to secure the election of an official who, if elected, would have authority over the administration of funds derived from an Act of Congress totalling $10,000 or more for a year before or after the election or offense. Prescribes criminal penalties to be imposed against anyone who defrauds the inhabitants of the United States of the honest services of a public official. Prescribes criminal penalties to be imposed upon any official who: (1) uses interstate commerce to defraud the inhabitants of the United States, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or Indian country of the right to have government affairs conducted on the basis of complete, true, and accurate information; or (2) in order to carry out or conceal any scheme or artifice to defraud, discriminates against, harrasses, or takes adverse action against any employee or official of the United States, any State or political subdivision, or an Indian tribal government. Amends mail fraud provisions to prohibit the use of any facility of interstate or foreign commerce in the execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud."
