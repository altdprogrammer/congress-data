    "text": "AIDS Control Act of 1989 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the Centers for Disease Control to keep records of cases of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations to require that, as a condition of receiving a license, any entity which collects or distributes blood or blood components or derivatives: (1) test all donors for the HIV; and (2) allow directed and autologous blood donations. Requires that recipients of grants under provisions relating to population research and family planning programs provide individuals with certain information concerning prevention of infection with the HIV. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant under title XXV (Prevention of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) of the Public Health Service Act to support a project for education, testing, or counseling concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) unless the State requires that: (1) physicians and medical technicians report to public health authorities the names and addresses of HIV-infected individuals; and (2) such reporting be carried out in accordance with State laws regulating confidentiality of records for individuals with sexually transmitted diseases. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant under such title and any State from obligating or expending any funds made available under such Act unless the State requires notification of the spouse of an AIDS-infected patient. Prohibits a State from obligating or expending funds made available under such title unless the State closes all bathhouses where a pattern of continuous homosexual sexual activity or continuous illegal intravenous drug use occurs. Prohibits the use of funds under such title: (1) to provide individuals with hypodermic needles or syringes so that they may use illegal drugs, or to distribute bleach for cleaning needles for such use; (2) to promote condoms as a method to prevent the spread of AIDS or to provide condoms; (3) to provide AIDS education, information, or prevention materials and activities that promote or encourage, directly or indirectly, homosexual sexual activities; or (4) unless the State requires marriage license applicants to be tested for infection with the HIV and both individuals to be notified of each test result. Amends the Federal criminal code to create a new chapter regarding public health preservation. Makes it unlawful for any individual to knowingly donate or attempt to donate blood, semen, or organs if that individual knows he or she is infected with the HIV, is a member of certain groups (including African and Haitian immigrants, hemophiliacs, prostitutes, homosexuals, and intravenous drug users) at high risk of contracting AIDS, or has engaged in activity which places such person at high risk of contracting AIDS. Provides for criminal fines and imprisonment. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to test each person incarcerated in a Federal penal or correctional institution for the HIV infection at the time of entry, annually, and at any other appropriate time. Requires reports on positive test results to be made to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control. Requires that prisoners testing positive for HIV infection be placed in separate residential facilities and be restricted from holding any employment in the institution which may increase transmission of HIV. Prohibits the induction or retention in the armed forces, other than in a retired status, of a person infected with HIV. Requires individuals to be tested for HIV infection prior to induction. Requires members of the armed forces to be tested for the HIV infection: (1) at least once a year; (2) whenever admitted to any medical facility of the uniformed services or of the Veterans Administration (effective March 1989, Department of Veterans Affairs) for in-patient care; and (3) at other times as the Secretary concerned considers appropriate. Amends the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide for a program of routine testing of each VA patient for infection with the HIV. Requires the VA to provide pre- and post-test counseling. Amends Federal law relating to veterans' benefits and confidentiality of certain medical records to require a physician or professional counselor to disclose information or records indicating that a patient or subject is infected with the HIV to a spouse or sexual partner. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations requiring the recipient of funds under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act to routinely test for infection with the HIV, and provide pre- and post-testing counseling, to each person receiving treatment for tuberculosis, substance abuse, or a sexually transmitted disease. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations requiring all airmen applying for certification to operate a commercial airplane to undergo annual testing for the HIV. Requires any airmen who test positive to be denied certification."
