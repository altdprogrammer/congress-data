    "text": "United States and the United States of Mexico Air Quality Improvement Act - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to negotiate with Mexican representatives to establish a program to monitor and improve air quality along the U.S.-Mexican border region. Requires the monitoring component of such program to identify sources of pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards and other air quality goals have been established. Authorizes the Administrator to negotiate with the appropriate Mexican representatives to develop remediation measures to reduce the level of pollutants to achieve air quality standards in the border region. Requires such program to identify control measures the implementation of which would be expedited by U.S. material and financial assistance. Directs the Administrator to utilize resources of Mexico to offset the costs to the United States in implementing joint remediation measures. Requires the U.S. Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on the air quality program, including ways to improve such program and whether such program should be continued or expanded to include Canada and other nations. Directs the Administrator to report annually to the Congress on the progress of the program in bringing the U.S.-Mexican border region into attainment with air quality standards. Requires the Administrator, in providing direct financial assistance to Mexico for the monitoring and remediation programs, to develop grant agreements with Mexico to assure the accuracy of monitoring data and the performance of remediation measures financed by the United States. Directs the Administrator, when approving State Implementation Plans, to take into account the impacts of the sources of pollutants coming from Mexico and the role of the United States in developing monitoring and remediation plans with Mexico to bring about attainment of air quality standards in regions along the border in the United States."
