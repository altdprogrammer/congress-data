Prescribes purposes for which the Secretary may provide such funds. States that funds provided by this Act shall not exceed 50 percent of the total project cost. Empowers the Secretary to consider projects that provide a greater leverage of Federal funds. Subjects any payment made to an agreement that conversion, use, or disposal of the assisted project for purposes contrary to this Act shall result in a right of the United States of compensation of all funds made available to such project, or the proportion of the increased value of the project attributable to such funds as determined at the time of such conversion, use, or disposal, whichever is greater. Increases the authorization of appropriations for each year in which the Commission is in existence and authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 through 1993 for purposes of the experimental program."
