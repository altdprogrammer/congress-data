Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to establish a pilot program to conduct National Health Service Corps recruitment seminars. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring that areas designated as health manpower shortage areas before enactment of this Act demonstrate a need for at least one additional full-time equivalent practitioner in order to continue to be so designated. Directs the Secretary to: (1) project Corps field strength necessary to ensure adequate physician manpower in shortage areas until the year 2019; and (2) establish a plan for maintaining such strength. Adds physicians' assistants programs to the list of degree programs eligible for Corps scholarships and loan repayments."
