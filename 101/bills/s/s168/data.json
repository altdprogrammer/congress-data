Makes it unlawful for any person seeking to obtain such programming for distribution or resale to enter into, extend, renew, or continue a contract or agreement for the distribution or sale of any such service if such contract has the purpose or effect of establishing an exclusive distributorship for such service to consumers within an area for which a cable franchise has been awarded, unless: (1) the programming service is not necessary to compete in such area; (2) there is no competitor in the area; or (3) such service was offered at nondiscriminatory prices, terms, and conditions to all requesting competitors regardless of each competitor's delivery technology."
