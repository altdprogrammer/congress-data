Amends Federal law to prohibit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from using this tax return information to terminate, deny, suspend, or reduce a person's benefits or services without first: (1) taking appropriate steps to verify independently the amount and accessibility of the income in question; and (2) providing the affected individual with notice and an opportunity to respond to the findings. Restricts the Secretary's right to verify or act upon information relating to disability compensation. Directs the Secretary to notify applicants for, and recipients of, Department benefits that income information they provide may be compared with tax return data."
