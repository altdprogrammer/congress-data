    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1990-09-19", 
    "text": "Act to Eliminate Revolving-Door Prison Terms for Drug Dealers and Other Convicted Criminals - Amends the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act to require the Secretary of Defense to transfer real property or facilities located at a military installation to be closed or realigned in the following order of priority: (1) to the Department of Justice, for use as a prison or other correctional institution; (2) to the States, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. possession or territory for such use; and (3) to any other transferee pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Requires the Secretary, before making any decision about transferring any such property or facility, to consult with the Governor of the State and the heads of the local governments in which the real property or facility is located and consider any plan by the local government concerned for the use of such property. Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to identify and make a list of not less than 20 parcels of surplus Federal property which the Attorney General has certified are not needed for Federal correctional facilities but which may be suitable for State or local correctional facilities. Authorizes the Attorney General to use tent housing, on a temporary basis, for Federal prisoners at the military facilities acquired under such Act and at any other Federal prison faciity, with the length of use of such housing at the Attorney General's discretion. Authorizes and encourages the States to consider using temporary tent housing to house prisoners instead of releasing them before they have completed their full sentence. Amends the Federal criminal code to bar Federal courts from holding the use of temporary tent housing unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff proves that such housing causes the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment of that particular inmate. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to: (1) seek to cut the cost of prison construction by reducing expenditures for color television, pool tables, cable television, air conditioning, and other amenities; and (2) submit to the Congress a description and summary of the results of such cost saving efforts. Declares it to be Federal policy that convicted Federal prisoners shall work, with the type of work dictated by appropriate security considerations and by the health of the prisoner, but that such work may include hard labor."
