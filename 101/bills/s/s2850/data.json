Provides that such projects may include the construction and renovation of hospitals and other health facilities to deliver health care services which meet the health needs of Indians. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with, or make grants to, any Indian tribe or tribal organization to carry out such a demonstration project. Sets forth requirements for applications for such demonstration projects, including an assessment of the status of Indian health services and facilities and a proposal describing the facilities to be constructed or renovated and the health care program to be carried out under the project and outlining project costs, funding sources, and staffing requirements. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria for considering and approving applications. Directs the Secretary to establish review panels to assist in such consideration that include tribal representatives and experts in rural health and Indian health facility construction and program implementation. Provides for congressional review of such criteria. Directs the Secretary to provide technical and other assistance to enable interested applicants to comply with this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish, within the Indian Health Service (IHS), a Branch of Health Facilities Demonstration within its Office of Health Programs to oversee demonstration projects under this Act and to coordinate the provision of such technical assistance to applicants and grantees. Makes certain individuals (including persons under age 19 and non-Indian spouses) who are not otherwise eligible for services provided by IHS eligible for health services under such a project. Authorizes appropriations."
