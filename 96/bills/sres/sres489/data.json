    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the total amount obligated by the executive branch of Government for fiscal year 1981 for (a) transportation and travel expenses of employees, or (b) the use of experts or consultants, should not exceed an amount which is $500,000,000 less than the amount appropriated therefor in the Federal Budget for fiscal year 1981; (2) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should allocate such reductions among the instrumentalities of the executive branch and report on such allocation to Congress; and (3) in allocating such reduction in travel and transportation costs, no funds for debt collection or loan supervision should be reduced and the funds of one instrumentality should not be reduced by more than 15 percent. Declares that it is further the sense of the Senate that: (1) Federal agencies should establish procedures to identify the causes of overpayments and delinquent payments of debts owed to the United States, establish better control over receivables, and take more aggressive collection action including the use of commercial collection agencies; (2) the Department of the Treasury should revise its fiscal requirements manual to require interest charges on delinquent accounts and more complete reporting on such accounts; (3) OMB should emphasize accounting system approval and collection efforts as part of the budget process; (4) the Internal Revenue Service should institute a debt collection system providing that debts owed to the United States will be retained out of any tax refunds payable to the debtor; and (5) the Congress should consider the extent to which requested new budget authority for an agency may be reduced as a result of the collection of debts and as an incentive to promote increased collection of debts. Directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of the Treasury, the head of each executive department and agency, and the Director of OMB."
