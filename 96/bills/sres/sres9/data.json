    "text": "Amends rule III of the Standing Rules of the Senate to permit the suspension of the reading of the Journal by motion without debate. Directs that motions to correct the Journal shall be confined to an accurate description of the proceedings and determined without debate. Amends rule VIII to set forth a 30 minute time limitation on debate on motion to proceed to consider any matter made after two O'clock, with the time to be divided by the Majority and Minority Leaders. Amends rule XV to permit the waiver of a demand for the reading of an amendment if the amendment has been identified by the clerk and is available in printed form to all Members. Amends rule XVIII to allow a motion, twice in any calendar day, that no amendment other than the reported committee amendments, which is not germane or related to the subject matter of the bill being considered shall be in order. Directs that such motion be decided without debate. Stipulates that such motion be carried by an affirmative three fifths of the Senators present and voting. Stipulates that this provision shall not apply to other Senate rules relating to germaneness and relevancy of amendments. Amends rule XXII to limit to 100 hours, with exceptions, the time for consideration of the measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been invoked. Allows the length of time to be increased or decreased, by ten hours, by the adoption of a motion, decided without debate, by a three- fifths affirmative vote of the Senators duty chosen and sworn. States that after cloture has been invoked no Senator shall speak for more than one hour on the measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate. Declares that if a motion to invoke cloture has been filed after September 1 of each calendar year, consideration shall be in order, and after three hours of debate the Senate shall vote on the adoption of that motion. Amends rule XXVII to allow the suspension of the reading of a conference report without debate. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended, to stipulate that the committee report on a measure or matter considered by any standing committee of the Senate must be available to the Members of the Senate for at least two calendar days (excluding weekends and holidays, except when the Senate is in session on such days) in order to be considered. Directs the Committee on Rules and Administration to provide for the installation of an electronic voting system in the Senate Chamber, with expenses paid from the contingent fund of the Senate."
