Rept. 96-1042) Declares that any records of the Senate, or of any Senate committee, which were made public prior to their transfer to the General Services Administration, may be made available for public use. Provides that any other records shall not be available to the public for 20 years, and in the case of investigative files, for 50 years. Authorizes Senate committees to prescribe different timetables for the disclosure of their records. Stipulates that this resolution does not authorize public disclosure of any record where such disclosure is prohibited by law or Executive Order. Authorizes the Secretary of the Senate to prohibit or restrict public disclosure of any transferred record, other than Senate committee records, upon the determination that such disclosure would not be in the public interest."
