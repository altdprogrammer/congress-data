Urges the Secretary, in consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to appoint a task force to educate farmers as to the availability of futures markets and forward contracting as a means of hedging against future risks. States that the Secretary should report to the Senate with plans 120 days after enactment of this Resolution."
