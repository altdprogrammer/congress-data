Allows such panel to request the Select Committee to issue subpoenas for the purpose of presenting evidence to the panel. Requires the panel, after receiving such evidence, to make a report of findings of fact to the Select Committee. Allows the Select Committee to remand the report to the panel for further proceedings, discharge the panel, or receive additional evidence itself. Requires the Select Committee to draw conclusions and formulate such recommendations as it deems warranted by the evidence, and make a full report of the results to the Senate."
