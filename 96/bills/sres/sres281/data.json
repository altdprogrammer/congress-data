    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate to direct Senate committees to make expenditures for committee employees out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may be authorized by resolutions of the Senate. Specifies that balances on February 28, 1981, of funds made available during the 96th Congress to standing committees of the Senate for committee employees may only be expended by resolutions of the Senate. Requires that staff members appointed to assist minority members of committees be treated equitably with respect to the fixing of salary rates, the assignment of facilities, and the accessibility of committee records. Provides that effective March 1, 1981, until otherwise provided by law, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to expend an amount not to exceed $25,000 each fiscal year for expenses incurred in the interchange and reception in the United States of prominent officials of foreign government and intergovernmental organizations. Directs each committee to report one authorization resolution each year authorizing the committee to make expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate to defray its expenses during the period beginning on March 1 of such year and ending on the last day of February of the following year. Allows each committee to procure authorization to make additional expenditures during that year only by reporting a supplemental authorization resolution which shall amend the annual authorization resolution of such committee for that year and be accompanied by a report specifying the purpose of such authorization."
