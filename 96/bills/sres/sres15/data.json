Rept. 96-119) Expresses the sense of the Senate that treaties or treaty provisions should not be terminated by the President without Congressional concurrence except where: (1) such treaty or treaty provisions have been superseded by subsequent statute or treaty; or (2) factors recognized by international law or provisions of the treaty itself give rise to a right of termination or suspension by the United States. Prohibits such termination or suspension by the President without Congressional approval where: (1) imminent involvement of the United States Armed Forces in hostilities or other danger to national security would result; or (2) a condition of the treaty ratification resolution specifying a termination or suspension procedure would be inconsistent with the President's termination or suspension of such treaty."
