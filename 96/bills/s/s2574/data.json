    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Finance with amendment, S. Rept. 96-1009) State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act Amendments of 1980 - =Title I: Extension and Revision of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972= - Amends the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on the State and Local Government Fiscal Assistance Trust Fund by March 1 (presently June 1) of each fiscal year. Extends the authorization of appropriations for local government entitlements and noncontiguous States until September 30, 1985. Authorizes separate appropriations for payments to State governments and U.S. Territories for fiscal years 1982-1985. Revises the allocation of such funds to remove the provision requiring the allocation of two-thirds of each State's share among local governmental units. Repeals the provision requiring the addition to the county entitlement of local governmental unit entitlements which fall below a specified amount for six or nine months. Reallocates excess amounts allocated to local governmental units among other local governmental units within the State (currently increases the State entitlements). Reduces the entitlement of Louisiana law enforcement offices for fiscal year 1981 and any year for which no State government payments are appropriated. Reduces the adjusted taxes of local governmental units for purposes of determining the general tax effort factor based on the amount by which average per capita taxes exceed 250 percent of the average per capita taxes for similar local governmental units. Repeals the requirement that State and local governments report to the Secretary on their use of revenue sharing funds. Requires the statement of assurances submitted by such governments to include assurances that public hearings on the use of funds will be held and that auditing requirements will be met. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such auditing requirements if substantial progress is demonstrated toward making financial accounts auditable or meeting generally accepted auditing standards. States that, when practicable, auditing requirements for revenue sharing and for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall be combined. Repeals the provision for a study of revenue sharing and federalism. Directs the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to study and report to the Senate Finance Committee on optional revenue sharing payments to State governments in lieu of categorical grants. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the fiscal impact of revenue sharing payments on general purpose governmental units. Authorizes the OMB Director to exempt revenue sharing programs from the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977. Exempts this title from restrictions on legislation providing new contracting, borrowing, or entitlement authority. Directs the Secretary to request the Bureau of the Census to adjust the population data to include a reasonable estimate of people not counted in the 1980 census to be used in calculating allocations for the next entitlement period. Provides for the allocation of revenue sharing funds to U.S. Territories beginning with fiscal year 1982. =Title II: Antirecession Fiscal Assistance= - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make payments to State, local, and territorial governments based on the rate of unemployment in excess of 7.5 percent. Authorizes appropriations for such payments for fiscal years 1981-1985. Sets forth formulas for the allocation of such funds among State, local and specified territorial government. Prohibits payments to local governments with a per capita income in excess of 150 percent of the national per capita income. Directs such payments to be used for the maintenance of basic services. Requires State and local governments to file a statement of assurances with the Secretary in order to receive such payments. Prohibits any discrimination under any program receiving funds under this title. Requires compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act with respect to wage rates for constructions project funded under this title. Requires the Secretary to withhold such payments for failure to comply with any assurance contained in the statement of assurances. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress quarterly concerning such payments. Requires the Secretary of Labor to provide the necessary data for administration of this title. =Title III: Discharge of Certain State Obligations= - Discharges States from the obligation to repay the United States for specified deposits made in 1836."
