    "text": "Alien Education Assistance Act of 1980 - Title I: General Provisions - Defines the terms used in this Act, including the term \"alien children\" which is defined to mean undocumented aliens who receive educational services from State or local educational agencies. Authorizes appropriations in necessary amounts up to $200,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 for State educational programs and administrative costs under this Act. Provides that such entitlements shall be ratably reduced if sufficient funds are available. Authorizes up to one percent of such funds for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to withhold funds from State educational agencies that fail to meet the requirements of this Act. Sets forth the procedures to be followed in such a situation. Permits the use of classroom facilities obtained by a local educational agency with assistance under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 in any fiscal year for educational services for alien children if the number of alien children enrolled in the elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of such agency, during that fiscal year, is equal to at least 200 or at least two percent of the total number of students enrolled in the public elementary or secondary schools during such fiscal year, whichever is less. Exempts each local educational agency within a State in which there is a State law which requires a bilingual education program from specified proposed rules (or final rules based on them) which prohibit recipients of Federal financial assistance from denying equality of access to any student because of that student's limited proficiency in English. Title II: General Assistance for Local Educational Agencies - Directs the Secretary to make payments to State educational agencies for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 for assistance to local educational agencies in providing basic education for alien children. Sets the amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is entitled, per alien child enrolled in schools under the jurisdiction of each local agency within such State, at $1,500, or the average per pupil expenditure in such State, whichever is less. Sets forth grant application requirements and procedures."
