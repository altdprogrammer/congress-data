    "text": "Department of Energy Organization Act Amendment of 1980 - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to provide for a proposed remedial order, rather than a remedial order, to be issued for violations of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973. Directs the Secretary of Energy to stay the effect of any such order if the recipient contests such order, unless the public interest requires immediate compliance with such order. Gives contesting recipients the option to elect to have proposed remedial orders reconsidered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or by the Secretary of Energy, unless the Commission has already issued a recommended decision."
