    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-08-05", 
    "text": "Cuban/Haitian Entrant Act of 1980 - Establishes a Cuban/Haitian Entrant status for: (1) Cubans who (a) were paroled into the United States between April 20, 1980, and June 20, 1980, or (b) had applications for asylum pending as of June 19, 1980; and (2) Haitians who (a) were in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of June 19, 1980, (b) were paroled into the United States before June 20, 1980, or (c) had applications for asylum pending as of June 19, 1980. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) permit such Entrants to work in the United States; and (2) deny or terminate such status if the alien (a) was excludable under specified sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, (b) was involved in the persecution of others, (c) was convicted of certain nonpolitical crimes, or (d) poses a security threat to the United States. Authorizes the Attorney General to adjust the status of an Entrant to that of an immigrant after two years' residence (as an Entrant) in the United States. Authorizes the waiver of specified grounds for exclusion for humanitarian or family purposes or if in the national interest. Prohibits such a waiver respecting: (1) national security; (2) association with the Nazi government; or (3) narcotics trafficking. States that any such status adjustment shall not be counted against the immigration admissions limitations. Requires a State to submit a plan to the Secretary of Health and Human Services describing the services to be provided to such Entrants in fiscal year 1981 for reimbursement purposes. Provides for: (1) a 75 percent reimbursement of a State's non- Social Security Act medical and cash benefits, related health and social (employment preparation, language) services, child welfare services, and special public school services to such Entrants; and (2) 100 percent reimbursement for an unaccompanied Haitian or Cuban child (until age 18 or older if a State's child welfare laws so provide) for whom a State has assumed full legal responsibility. Authorizes the Secretary to assume legal responsibility (including financial responsibility) for such unaccompanied children until placement has been arranged. Limits reimbursement (except for unaccompanied children) to assistance or services furnished between July 1, 1980, and July 1, 1981, or if later, the month in which the individual leaves the Federal processing center. Authorizes: (1) reimbursement for administrative expenses not to exceed 75 percent of such expenses; and (2) the Secretary to set recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Prohibits reimbursement to a State for: (1) in-kind contributions; and (2) specified services to an individual granted asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act after he/she has received Entrant status. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to close the period, as of July 1, 1980, during which services provided to certain applicants for asylum will be reimbursed. Prohibits any alien granted Entrant status from applying for asylum. Reduces the time period for appealing a deportation order from six months to 30 days. Limits judicial review of asylum proceedings to a proceeding challenging a final deportation or exclusion order. Revises alien deportation and maintenance expense provisions to: (1) provide that deportation shall be to the country from which the alien boarded the vessel or airplane that brought him to the United States; (2) provide that if such departure was from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States of which such alien was not a national or resident, then deportation shall be to the country from which such alien departed for such contiguous territory; (3) set forth guidelines for the Attorney General if a country is unwilling to accept a deportable alien; and (4) require such transportation lines to deposit a bond to cover any fine or disputed fine relating to deportation with a district director of customs (presently with a customs collector). Increases such fines from $300 to $1000. Repeals existing law authorizing the status adjustment (to immigrant status) of Cuban nationals after one year's U.S. residence."
