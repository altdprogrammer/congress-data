Rept. 96-774) =Title I=: National Small Hydroelectric Power Development Act of 1980 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, to allot funds for the planning and design of small hydroelectric projects, when deemed advisable by the Chief of Engineers. Authorizes the Secretary to construct such projects after entering into a written agreement with a non-Federal public entity concerning the operation, maintenance, electric rates, and repayment of the costs of such projects. Limits the size of and the Federal contribution to any such project. Directs Federal agencies to simplify procedures and expedite consideration of any licenses needed by such facilities. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress concerning the implementation of this title with any recommendations. Directs the Secretary to survey the potential and methods for rehabilitating facilities for use in developing hydroelectric facilities. =Title II=: National Water Resources Policy and Development Demonstration Act of 1980 - Authorizes the States to request the Water Resources Council for detailed studies of specific water resources needs. Directs each State, after public hearings, to submit to the Council a list of those studies, in order of priority, which such State wishes to have undertaken or completed by the appropriate Federal water resources agencies. Authorizes such agencies to make detailed evaluations of specific water resources needs. Requires affected Governors to appoint State employees to work in cooperation with the appropriate agency before any study can be initiated. Requires the appropriate agencies to submit a detailed report at the conclusion of a study to the Council along with certification by the appropriate Governor that implementation of the project is desirable. Requires such agencies to consolidate hearings and studies and to assure that expenditures for such studies are equitably allocated among the States. Deems a project authorized for implementation 90 days after the Council publishes the summary of the study report, agency recommendations, and the governor's certification. Requires congressional authorization of a project if: (1) an affected Governor objects; (2) the Federal agency and the Council recommend against implementation of such project; or (3) implementation will be undertaken outside the terms of this title. Directs the States to submit annual priority lists of authorized water resources projects to the Council, taking into account recommendations by the appropriate river basin commission. Deems such list approved after 30 days unless the Council determines that such list was developed without public hearings. Authorizes a project to be implemented, despite the project's cost-benefit ratio, if the project is on a State's priority list and the Governor determines that the project will provide other significant benefits. Sets forth the formulas for allocating appropriated sums among the States. Requires the Council to report to Congress concerning: (1) the implementation of projects under this title in comparison with those otherwise authorized; (2) a detailed estimate of needs and costs of water resources projects in the future; and (3) cost-sharing mechanisms for water resources projects."
