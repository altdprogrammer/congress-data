    "text": "Amends the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to permit the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide for batch-by-batch certification of a drug within the purview of such Act intended for human use. Establishes the criteria for such certification. Permits the Secretary to issue a release, in lieu of certification, for any batch manufactured prior to the effective date of such certification if the Secretary judges such batch safe. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt certain drugs or categories of drugs from this Act. Permits any interested party to file a petition proposing the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any regulation issued under this Act. Requires the Secretary to: (1) publish notice of such proposal; (2) afford all interested parties an opportunity to present their views; (3) make public his action on such proposals; (4) hold public hearings if objections are made to such action; and (5) make public his action on such objections. Requires every person engaged in the manufacture, compounding, or processing, of any drug within the purview of such Act to maintain records and make such reports relating to clinical experiences as the Secretary determines necessary to assure compliance with such Act."
