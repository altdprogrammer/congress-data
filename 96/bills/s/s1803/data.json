    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Modifies the exterior boundary of the Cibola National Forest in New Mexico to include an area of approximately 14,476 acres. Declares that all lands owned by the United States which are added to the Forest shall be administered in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. States that for purposes of applicable statutory provisions, such modified boundaries shall be treated as if they were the boundaries of the Forest on January 1, 1965. Amends the Act which provides financial assistance to the school district within the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, to extend, for two years, the period of such assistance. Authorizes appropriations, through fiscal year 1982, to carry out the provisions of such Act. Specifies that any such amounts authorized but not appropriated in any fiscal year shall remain available for appropriation in succeeding fiscal years. Prohibits the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, from taking any legal or administrative action in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Conchas Lake Project, New Mexico, seeking to remove improvements, including dwellings, that are presently located within the flowage easement below a specified level. Specifies that such prohibition shall not be construed as creating any liability in the United States for any injury, loss, or damage accruing to the owners of such improvements, their lessees occupants, as a result of any flooding or inundation of such improvements by the waters of the reservoir, or for such injury, loss, or damage as may occur through the operation and maintenance of the dam and reservoir in any manner. Prohibits the Secretary from determining the cabin site in the south recreation area at Conchas Lake to be excess of project needs prior to 1996, unless such a determination is agreed to by the Governor of New Mexico. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring the removal or sale and purchase of existing cabins, cottages, or other privately owned improvements located on such site prior to 1996, unless agreed to by the Governor of New Mexico. Requires existing and prospective lease arrangements to reflect such requirements. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay a specified amount out of any funds in the Treasury, not otherwise appropriated, to the estate of Demetrio Madrid or into a court of competent jurisdiction, for distribution to such persons as shall be lawfully entitled. Specifies that no amount in excess of ten percent of any such payment shall be paid to or received by any agent or attorney in consideration for services rendered in connection with such payment. Makes any mining claim located under the Mining Laws of the United States subsequent to June 18, 1879, and prior to January 17, 1969, in a specified area of the State of Arizona, effective to the same extent in all respects as if such lands at the time of location, and at all times thereafter, had been open to the operation of the Mining Laws of the United States."
