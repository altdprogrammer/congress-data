    "text": "Nondiscrimination in Insurance Act - Prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin with respect to the issuance or terms of insurance contracts. Permits insurers who regularly provide insurance solely to persons of a single religious affiliation to continue to do so. Allows any person who is aggrieved by any violation of this Act to maintain a civil action in an appropriate State or Federal court. Sets forth the recovery allowed in such an action, including injunctive relief and punitive damages. Authorizes the Commissioner and Attorney General of each State to enforce the discriminatory prohibitions established by this Act. Permits the Commissioner to issue cease and desist orders and the Attorney General to intervene in administrative proceedings, seek injunctive relief, order restitution, and impose fines. Stipulates that no action may be maintained in Federal court if a State has enacted into law the provisions of this Act and has established administrative procedures to consider violations. Authorizes the Attorney General of the United States, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that any insurer or other person is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this Act or that any group has been denied such rights and an issue of general public importance is raised, to bring a civil action in Federal court to seek injunctive or other appropriate relief."
