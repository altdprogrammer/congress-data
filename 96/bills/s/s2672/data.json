    "text": "Community Energy Assistance Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to provide grants on an annual basis to eligible communities which plan to commit such grant funds and local funds to local energy conservation and renewable resource programs. Directs the Secretary to allot appropriations for any fiscal year among the State areas according to a formula set forth in this Act. Requires that funds be allotted among the eligible communities within any State area on the basis of population and the latest reliable data available to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to review, as necessary, whether program grantees conform with the requirements of this Act and other applicable laws. Allows the Secretary to adjust the amount of grant funds if the Secretary discovers the funds were misused. Prohibits such adjustments from recapturing or deducting from future grant funds that have already been spent on eligible activities."
