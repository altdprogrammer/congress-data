    "text": "Victims of Crime Act of 1979 - Establishes a nine-member, part-time Advisory Committee on Victims of Crime to advise the Attorney General with respect to the administration of this Act and the compensation of victims of crime. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified State programs for the compensation of victims of crime. States that such grants shall total: (1) 25 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of State crimes designated by the State as appropriate for compensation under this program; and (2) 100 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and survivors of victims of crimes which would constitute designated State crimes except for the fact that the crime is subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Specifies criteria for a State plan to qualify under this Act, including that such plan: (1) offers compensation for personal injuries suffered as a result of certain State and Federal crimes; (2) offers compensation to surviving dependents of any person whose death resulted from being victim to such a crime; (3) grants claimants the right to a hearing; (4) requires cooperation with law enforcement agencies as a condition for recovery; (5) does not have a financial means test; (6) subrogates the State to any claim the victim or dependent has against the perpetrator to the extent of the amount compensated by the State; (7) does not require claimants to seek welfare benefits; (8) denies or reduces any claim where the victim or claimant contributed to the death or injury; (9) may require the criminal by State law or rule to make restitution to the victim; and (10) does not require that any person be apprehended or convicted of the crime giving rise to the claim. Permits States with programs not in compliance with this Act to remain eligible for grants under this Act until the day after the close of the first regular State legislative session that begins after the effective date of this Act. Sets forth specified expenses that may not be included in the State program's cost of paying compensation when determining the amount of the grant for which such program is eligible. Directs the Attorney General to submit annual reports to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with respect to each qualifying State program, and the activities of the Attorney General in carrying out this Act. Requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on the appropriateness of requiring State laws which prevent criminal wrongdoers from enjoying profits made from publicity surrounding their wrongdoing."
