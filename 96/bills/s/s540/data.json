Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act through fiscal year 1982. Sets forth the formula for distributing such funds among the States. Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to States maintaining approved dam safety programs. Specifies the standards such program must meet. Directs the Secretary to provide guarantees to insurers in order to enable dam owners, in States with approved dam safety programs, to obtain liability insurance at reasonable rates. Requires the Secretary, with the Secretary of the Treasury, to report to Congress with any recommendations for a more comprehensive dam safety insurance program. Authorizes appropriations for a revolving fund to be used for loans to dam owners making dam repairs or other safety improvements. Authorizes the establishment of a Federal Dam Safety Review Board to be responsible for reviewing dam safety procedures and monitoring State implementation of this Act. Directs the Secretary: (1) to provide training for State dam safety inspectors; and (2) to develop improved dam inspection techniques."
