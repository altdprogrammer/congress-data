    "date": "1980-04-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to define the term \"ghost fishing\" to mean the capture of fish by lost or abandoned pots, traps, gill nets, and other fixed gear of a similar nature, and the term \"degradable device\" to mean a device which after one month renders lost fishing gear ineffective. Prohibits, after January 1, 1981, the use of any fishing gear within the Fishery Conservation Zone that the Secretary of Commerce finds can ghost fish unless such gear is equipped with a degradable device in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Prohibits the shipping, transporting, offering for sale, selling, purchasing, importing, or exporting in interstate commerce any fishing gear that the Secretary finds can ghost fish unless such gear is equipped with a degradable device in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary."
