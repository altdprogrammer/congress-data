    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into agreements providing for owner contributions to public works projects which will produce increased land values for the owner. Repeals the provision abolishing tolls on government canals. Limits the Secretary of the Army's authority to maintain and rehabilitate navigation projects without congressional authorization. Stipulates that reports to the appropriate congressional committees contain information concerning: (1) the possibility of failure of dam facilities; and (2) the impact on existing recreational facilities of projects including recreation benefits. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to be responsible for all calculations of transportation-related benefits for future water resources projects. Provides for the rescission and deauthorization of public works surveys which have not been made within a specified time or have an inactive or deferred status. Establishes an Advisory Board on Water Resources Complaints to evaluate complaints of adverse impact of water resources projects and make recommendations regarding any requested mitigation. Requires the Board to periodically report to specified congressional committees."
