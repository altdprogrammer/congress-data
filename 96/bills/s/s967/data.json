Finds that it is imperative that the Secretary of Energy examine every way in which the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 can be implemented to alleviate such crisis. Directs the Secretary of Energy to assess railroad coal hauling needs in the area served by the Milwaukee Railroad and to submit a report to the Congress within 30 days of enactment."
