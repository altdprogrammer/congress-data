    "text": "Debt Collection Act of 1980 - Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to permit a Federal agency to disclose records pertaining to an individual to a consumer reporting agency. Provides that a consumer reporting agency to which a record is disclosed shall not be considered a government contractor for purposes of such Act. Authorizes a Federal agency attempting to collect a claim under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 to notify a consumer reporting agency that a person is responsible for a claim if the agency: (1) has sent two written notices informing the person that a consumer reporting agency will be notified and the person has not agreed to pay the claim or filed for a review of the claim; and (2) has obtained assurances that the consumer reporting agency complies with Federal laws governing the provision of consumer credit information. Directs an agency to review a claim at the request of such person prior to notifying the reporting agency. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish regulations requiring each agency with authority to extend loans to report to the Director at least once each year on the activities of the agency to collect such loans. Requires the Director to analyze the reports received by each agency and to report annually to the Congress on the management of agency loan collection activities."
