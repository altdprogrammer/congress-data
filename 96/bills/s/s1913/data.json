Sets the amount of such credit at the excess of $10.50 over the rate of the additional tax on such wine which would be imposed but for its removal to bonded premises. Specifies the points in time for determining allowance of such credit for domestic and for imported distilled spirits containing wine. Excludes from such credit: (1) any substance which has been subject to distillation at a distilled spirits plant after receipt in bond; and (2) wine containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume."
