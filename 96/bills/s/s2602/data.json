    "text": "Local Hire Preference Act - Declares it to be the policy of the United States that in any area of substantial unemployment an employer engaged in a federally assisted activity shall give preference in hiring to residents of such area. Directs the Secretary of Labor to prescribe by regulation the conditions for residence for individuals within the area of substantial unemployment in which the federally assisted activity is undertaken. Provides that preference need not be given: (1) to the extent that qualified individuals regularly residing in the area or State are not available for such work; (2) for reasonable needs to employ supervisory or specially experienced personnel to assure efficient execution; or (3) if there is an obligation to hire other individuals as a result of a lawful collective bargaining agreement (in which case, up to 20 percent of the total number of employees may be nonresidents). Requires that each executive agency include, in any contract, subcontract, agreement, or other arrangement with an employer conducting a federally assisted activity which is likely to involve the hiring of employees, provisions designed to insure that the employer will: (1) place notification of the jobs available under such activity with the State employment service and with the appropriate prime sponsor under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), together with specified information; and (2) give full consideration to all qualified applicants for jobs referred by the State employment agency or an appropriate prime sponsor. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations and procedures for notification by the State employment agency and the appropriate prime sponsor that qualified individuals seeking employment are not available in the area of substantial unemployment. Requires that each executive agency report annually to the Secretary and the Secretary report annually to the Congress on the carrying out of the policy set forth in this Act. Directs the Secretary to carry out the functions of this Act through an agency established in the Department of Labor. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this Act in periods of national emergency or under very unusual circumstances. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
