Amends the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 to authorize regulations granting the Selective Service System access to age and address information in the records of any school, or any agency or political subdivision of any State for the sole purpose of conducting selective service registration. Requires the Secretary of Defense, in the Secretary's annual report to Congress on military manpower requirements, to include an assessment of the Nation's capabilities to mobilize such additional manpower as may be needed to meet national security requirements under emergency situations."
