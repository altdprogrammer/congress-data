Stipulates that such objects must be directly associated with human activities. Requires congressional approval of any Presidential proclamation of a national monument before it can effect a reservation of public lands in excess of 5,000 acres. Permits the continuance of uses of public lands within a national monument which were valid uses prior to the designation of such lands as a monument, including hunting, guiding, hiking, boating, and use of motorized vehicles. Stipulates that such uses must not adversely affect the objects sought to be protected by the reservation. Grants such provisions governing the proclamation of national monuments retroactive effect as of October 14, 1978. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to require congressional approval of withdrawals of public lands in excess of 5,000 acres by the Secretary of the Interior."
