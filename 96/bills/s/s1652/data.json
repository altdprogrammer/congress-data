Authorizes exemptions from prescribed guidelines for such labeling if the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare determines that compelling local conditions require the application of a satisfactory, but otherwise federally-pre-empted, State or local labeling statute or regulation. Authorizes the Secretary to approve demonstrations to ascertain the most effective methods of organizing a food label and of conveying required information to consumers. Requires written evaluations of such demonstrations. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to develop, pilot test, and implement a program of consumer education on how to use nutrition labels effectively. Directs the Secretary to notify the Federal Trade Commission of the nutritional information required on labeling and to recommend what information should be required on advertising."
