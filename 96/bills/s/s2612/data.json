    "text": "Swine Health Protection Act - Prohibits the feeding, or the permission to feed, of garbage to swine unless such garbage has been treated to kill disease organisms, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, at a facility holding a valid permit issued by the Secretary (or the chief agricultural or animal health official of a State with an agreement with the Secretary). Exempts waste from ordinary household operations which is fed directly to swine on the same premises as the household from coverage as \"garbage\" under this Act. Requires persons operating a garbage-treatment facility who know such garbage is to be fed to swine to hold a valid permit issued under this Act. Provides for the issuance, suspension, and revocation of such permits. Requires that such facilities, to be issued such permits: (1) meet requirements prescribed by the Secretary to prevent the introduction or dissemination of any infectious or communicable disease of animals or poultry; and (2) be so constructed that swine are unable to enter the premises or have access to untreated garbage or material coming in contact with such garbage. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Provides for general enforcement of this Act by the Attorney General, upon the request of the Secretary, in U.S. district courts. Provides for cooperative agreements with State agencies for coordination of enforcement, administration, and regulation under this Act and under State law. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to repeal or supercede any State law prohibiting the feeding of garbage to swine. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out this Act."
