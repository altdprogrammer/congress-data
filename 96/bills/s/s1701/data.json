    "text": "Automobile Full Warranty Act of 1979 - Amends the Magnuson-Moss-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act to apply to warranties for passenger motor vehicles the Federal minimum standards for warranties established by such Act. Defines the term \"passenger motor vehicle\" as a motor vehicle with motive power, designed for carrying 12 persons or less. Requires manufacturers and importers of new passenger motor vehicles to offer, by 1982, all purchasers a comprehensive warranty dispute resolution system comprising an informal dispute resolution procedure to remain in operation for three years. Requires that such systems operate under Consumer Product Safety Commission guidelines and meet specified standards set forth in this Act. Directs the Commission to report, with recommendations, on such systems by 1984. Declares that a court shall award a consumer who prevails in any action brought against a supplier, warrantor, or service contractor, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the cost to and expenses incurred by such consumer in the commencement of such action. Grants State and Federal courts jurisdiction over class actions in which the defendant stipulates that the proposed class is 100 persons or more. Prohibits courts from dismissing such actions on the grounds of failure to name 100 persons as plaintiffs unless a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery on this issue has been provided. Entitles the consumer to retain possession and use of the passenger motor vehicle during the pendency of the action."
