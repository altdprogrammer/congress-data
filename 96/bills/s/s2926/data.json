    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 6308 passed in lieu) Magnetic Fusion Energy Engineering Act of 1980 - Declares it to be the policy of the United States to: (1) establish a national goal of demonstrating the engineering feasibility of magnetic fusion by the early 1990's; (2) achieve, no later than the year 1990, operation of a magnetic fusion engineering device based on the best available confinement concept; and (3) establish as a national goal the operation of a magnetic fusion demonstration plant at the turn of the twenty-first century. Directs the Secretary of Energy to initiate activities or accelerate existing activities in research areas in which the lack of knowledge limits magnetic fusion energy systems in order to ensure the achievement of the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) maintain an aggressive plasma confinement research program on the current lead concept; (2) maintain a broadly based research program on alternate confinement concepts and advanced fuels; (3) ensure that research on properties of materials likely to be required for the construction of fusion engineering devices is adequate to provide timely information for the design of such devices; (4) initiate design activities on a fusion engineering device using the best available confinement concept to ensure operation of such device, no later than 1990; and (5) develop and test the adequacy of the engineering design components to be utilized in the fusion engineering device. Directs the Secretary to prepare a comprehensive program management plan for the conduct of the research, development, and demonstration activities under this Act. Directs the Secretary to develop a plan for the creation of a national magnetic fusion engineering center to accelerate fusion technology development via the concentration and coordination of major magnetic fusion engineering devices and associated activities at such a national center. Provides for the establishment of a technical panel on magnetic fusion of the Energy Research Advisory Board to review the conduct of the national magnetic fusion energy program. Requires the technical board to report at least triennially to the Energy Research Advisory Board, and requires the Board to report to the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to require the director of each magnetic fusion laboratory installation operated for, and funded by, the Federal Government to establish a program advisory committee solely for the purpose of advising such director. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to actively seek to enter into or to strengthen existing international cooperative agreements in magnetic fusion research and development activities of mutual benefit to all parties. Directs the Secretary to: (1) assess the adequacy of the supply of manpower in the engineering and scientific disciplines to achieve the purposes of this Act; (2) assure the dissemination of information concerning the national magnetic fusion program; and (3) report annually to Congress concerning activities undertaken pursuant to this Act."
