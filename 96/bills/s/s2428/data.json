    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish programs of land diversion payments with respect to the 1980 crops of feed grains and wheat. Requires producers seeking such payments to devote not more than 1,000 acres of crop land during the 1980 crop year to approved conservation purposes. Establishes a ceiling on the amount of total payments to feed grain and wheat producers under such programs. Sets forth the formulae for computing the payment to a producer under such programs. Sets payment rates, for the purposes of such formulae, at $1.25 per bushel for corn with all other feed grain prices fixed in relation to such price, and $1.50 per bushel of wheat. Directs the Secretary to implement and administer a special wheat acreage grazing and hay program for the 1980 crop year."
