Relieves the State of New Mexico from any liability for such reimbursement which arose prior to enactment as the result of the prison disruption in the New Mexico State Penitentiary in February, 1980. Requires the Director to report to the congressional judiciary committees by January 31, 1981, on the actual costs incurred by Federal facilities for the temporary placement of such State prisoners."
