Requires a single, independent, biennial, compliance, and financial audit of State and local government entities, nonprofit organizations, and subgrantees thereof which receive Federal assistance. Requires such an audit of an organization which receives less than $100,000 a year to be conducted quinquennially. Establishes the responsibility of State and local governments and nonprofit organizations to utilize independent auditors to conduct audits of Federal assistance recipients within their jurisdictions in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Makes the Federal Government responsible for: (1) utilizing the quality review process to be established by the Director of OMB and the Comptroller General to assure the proper performance of such audits; and (2) conducting audits which are not financial and compliance audits. Directs the OMB to establish methods of payment of independent auditors for the expense of performing all or any part of an audit on behalf of the Government. =Title III: Integrated Grant Development= - Integrated Grant Development Act of 1980 - Directs the President to issue guidelines necessary to assure that Federal agencies: (1) identify related Federal assistance programs that would be suitable for providing joint funding; (2) issue guidelines and develop materials to assist in the development of projects drawing support from different assistance programs; (3) review and modify administrative requirements which impede integrated grant development for projects; (4) establish common administrative rules with respect to related programs to assist in integrated grant development for specific projects; and (5) create joint or common procedures for processing applications, supervising projects, and evaluating performance including procedures insuring that agencies participating in integrated grant programs contribute proportionately to the lead agency's costs of administering the program. Requires the head of Federal agencies to cooperate with respect to Federal assistance programs which may be suitable for providing joint support of projects of State or local governments or nonprofit organizations.

Permits the review of integrated grant project proposals by a single board or committee. Allows an agency to delegate its functions for the administration of a Federal assistance program to another agency with the approval of the President.

Directs the President, at least two years before the provisions expire, to transmit to Congress a report which evaluates the administration of this title and makes recommendations for the continuation, modification, or termination of this title. =Title IV: Administration of Generally Applicable Federal Assistance Requirements= - Defines the term \"generally applicable requirement\" as any requirement with which a recipient of Federal assistance is required to comply in order to achieve national policy objectives, and which applies to programs administered by two or more agencies. Requires the President, within 120 days after enactment of this title, to designate Federal agencies to: (1) coordinate the preparation of national policy assistance standards for one or more generally applicable requirements in various subject areas; and (2) report on the implementation of such requirements. Directs the President to establish a date for the preparation of such standards which shall be not later than two years after enactment of this Act for existing requirements or two years after a requirement is established by statute or administrative rule. Directs each designated agency to organize and chair a task force to prepare such standards. Requires such a task force to consist of each assistance agency responsible for implementing the national policy objective. Requires that such standards eliminate any unnecessary compliance burdens for assistance recipients while ensuring the achievement of national policy assistance objectives. Directs each agency which administers a program to which such standards apply, to implement such standards within 120 days after they are published by a designated agency. Directs each designated agency to coordinate the implementation of such standards, and to insure that such standards are revised only on the first day of each fiscal year. Requires the head of each assistance agency to designate a senior official to: (1) coordinate such agency's actions to comply with such standards; and (2) ensure active agency participation in the development and implementation of such standards. Authorizes such agency head to certify that State and local governments are in compliance with State and local government requirements that contain the same requirements as national policy assistance standards.
