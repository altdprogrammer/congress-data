Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish rates for meals provided at mess halls sufficient to provide reimbursement of operating expenses and food costs to the appropriations concerned, except that members of the uniformed services and civilians in a travel status receiving a per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence shall be charged at a rate of not less than $2.50 per day."
