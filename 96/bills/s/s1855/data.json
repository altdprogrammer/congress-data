    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 to redefine the terms: (1) \"Indian\" to include a person who is either a member of an Indian tribe or eligible to receive services from the Secretary of the Interior; and (2) \"tribally controlled community college\" to mean a postsecondary institution which is controlled, sanctioned, or chartered by an Indian tribe. Defines the term \"postsecondary institution\" for purposes of such Act. Entitles such a college to technical assistance from the Secretary whether or not it satisfies the accreditation requirements of a postsecondary institution under such Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1981 and 1982 for the provision of such technical assistance."
