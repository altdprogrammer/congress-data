Sets forth procedures for the designation of a foreclosure commissioner or commissioners by the Secretary. Designates the Secretary as a guarantor of payment of any judgment against such commissioners. Permits a foreclosure by the Secretary to commence upon the breach of a covenant or condition in the mortgage agreement for which foreclosure is authorized under such mortgage. Specifies procedures for: (1) notice of default and foreclosure sale; (2) service of such notice; (3) presale reinstatement and cancellation of foreclosure; (4) conduct of a foreclosure sale; (5) disposition of foreclosure costs and sale proceeds; (6) transfer of title and possessions; and (7) recording the foreclosure and sale. Authorizes the Secretary to require, as a condition and term of sale, that the purchaser at a foreclosure sale under this Act agree to the continued operation of the security property in accordance with the appropriate loan program."
