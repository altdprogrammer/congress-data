    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1979-09-28", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #321 (43-39)) Industrial Equipment Efficiency Act of 1979 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, to add new definitions relating to energy efficiency of industrial equipment. Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary of Energy study the practicability and effect of requiring classes of electric motors and pumps to meet minimum energy efficiency performance standards. Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary evaluate other types of industrial equipment as to their energy use and efficiency. Directs the Secretary to select the classes or types of equipment for which he will establish test procedures. Stipulates that any such test procedures will be designed in consultation with equipment manufacturers and appropriate technical societies. Directs the Secretary to determine the types of equipment for which he will prescribe labeling rules and to consult with equipment manufacturers affected by proposed rules. Requires the Secretary to select the types of electric motors and pumps for which he will prescribe standby energy efficiency standards and sets forth procedures and criteria for issuing such standards. Exempts small business manufacturers of equipment from such standards upon a determination that imposition of such standards may cause serious economic hardship. Stipulates that if the Attorney General finds that the imposition of standards would have an anticompetitive impact, the Secretary shall withdraw such standards. Directs the Secretary to establish a market penetration schedule for \"high efficiency motors\" and \"high efficiency pumps\". Sets forth reporting requirements for specified manufacturers of electric motors and pumps. Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to the Congress on the results of such reports. Sets forth conditions under which standby energy efficiency standards may be removed from standby status and made effective. Incorporates the same provisions on rules, authority to obtain information, exports, imports, prohibited acts, enforcement, injunction enforcement, citizen suits, and administrative procedure and judicial review as are applicable to the appliance efficiency standards program of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
