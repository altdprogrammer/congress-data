Requires that such refunds for precomputed transactions repayable over a more than 36-month period be computed by a method at least as favorable to the consumer as an actuarial method in accordance with regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Permits the creditor to collect or retain a minimum charge not exceeding seven and one-half dollars if provided for by State law and the contract relating to the transaction. Requires creditors or assignees to provide consumers with statements of the amount due on any precomputed consumer credit account after such deductions of the finance charge and insurance premiums, within five days of receipt of an oral or written request from a consumer. Permits oral statements upon oral requests. Requires written statements upon written requests. Entitles consumers to one statement without charge each year. Permits reasonable fees for additional statements, if such fees are disclosed in advance."
