    "text": "Synthetic Fuel Requirements Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to issue regulations requiring that a percentage of all petroleum and natural gas products consumed in the United States be derived from synthetic fuels. Sets forth such requirements in terms of a 1986 goal of a minimum of 200,000 barrels equivalence per day extending to a 1990 goal of 2,000,000 barrels equivalence per day. Authorizes the Secretary to amend such requirements to the maximum feasible levels except that congressional approval is required if such amendments decrease the 1986 goal or increase the 1990 goal. Makes such requirements applicable to: (1) all domestic and offshore refiners selling products in the United States; (2) domestic petrochemical manufacturers; (3) importers of petroleum products and first generation petrochemicals; (4) final users of natural gas; and (5) crude oil energy producing facilities. Establishes civil penalties for failure to comply with such requirements and sets forth procedures for assessing and collecting such penalties, and authorizes judicial review of such assessment orders in the United States courts of appeals. Establishes a formula for determining compliance with the requirements of this Act. Directs the Department of Energy to issue negotiable excess use certificates to users of synthetic fuels who exceed their requirement."
