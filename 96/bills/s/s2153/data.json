    "text": "Occupational Safety and Health Improvements Act of 1980 - Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to exempt employers who maintain workplaces which qualify as non-hazardous, according to specified standards, from inspections or investigations, with specified exceptions. Directs the Secretary of Labor to enter into agreements with State workers' compensation or other appropriate State agencies under which such State agency will submit an annual list of all employers having one or more reported occupational injuries resulting in two or more lost workdays during the preceding year. Requires employers wishing to claim qualification for such exemptions to file an affidavit with the Secretary relating to the safety records of their workplaces. Limits the type or the amount of penalties which may be assessed against employers who maintain an advisory safety committee and a regular consultation program. Requires employers who qualify for exemptions from inspections or limitations on penalties to maintain records to which the Secretary has access. Provides for review by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and a U.S. court of appeals of rulings by the Secretary that workplaces do not qualify for exemptions from inspection or limitations on penalties. Prohibits considering consultant or committee reports or recommendations or employee assurances under this Act as evidence of a willful violation of such Act if the employer had a reasonable, good faith belief that the condition involved was not a violation. Prohibits specified liability claims against committees or consultants. Directs the Secretary to: (1) assist State agencies to make necessary procedural modifications; (2) report to Congress on State participation; (3) advise employers and employees of the provisions of this Act; (4) require inclusion of the provisions of this Act, or of similar provisions, for approval of State plans; (5) develop and implement other means to identify workplaces qualifying for exemption, as an alternative to the affidavit process; and (6) explore and report on other means to encourage voluntary self- initiative in workplaces to improve safety and health conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State agencies to improve their administration of State workers' compensation programs. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts through fiscal year 1985 for such purpose. Declares the effective date of this Act to be January 1, 1981."
