    "text": "Diplomatic Reciprocity Act - Establishes the Diplomatic Services Corporation within the executive branch to: (1) assist in determining the privileges and immunities to which members of foreign missions are entitled; and (2) assist and provide necessary services and benefits to foreign missions. Requires foreign missions, if the Secretary of States deems if necessary, to apply to such Corporation: (1) for a certificate of compliance with this Act before obtaining any benefits or services; or (2) to obtain such benefits or services directly from such Corporation. Authorizes the Corporation to pay a surcharge or meet other conditions before issuing such certification. Makes it unlawful for any person to contract to supply such benefits or services to foreign missions, unless the mission has obtained certification of compliance with this Act. Sets forth the powers of such Corporation. Authorizes other Federal agencies to provide services to, and accept services from such Corporation. Requires the Board of Directors to report semiannually to the Secretary and to Congress on the Corporation's activities. Grants tax-exempt status to such Corporation. Directs the heads of foreign missions to report to the Secretary concerning holdings or planned acquisitions of real property. Requires any interest in such property which is denied to the United States by the respective sending country to be sold unless the sending country accords the United States a comparable right. Exempts buildings of foreign missions from District of Columbia zoning and building regulations. Makes such buildings subject to the National Capital Park and Planning Commission."
