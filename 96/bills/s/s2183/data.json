Requires that all sums received by the Commodity Credit Corporation from the liquidation of loans made to finance short-term export credit sales of such agricultural commodities be added to and become a part of such fund. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 to such fund. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to Congress on the export credit sales program carried out by the Corporation in the last fiscal year. Abolishes such fund effective October 1, 1983. Requires that all unobligated money in such fund become a part of the miscellaneous receipts account of the Treasury."
