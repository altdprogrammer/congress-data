    "text": "Federal Administrative Improvements in Reports Act - Title I: Review of Reporting Forms - Terminates, three years after enactment of this Act, all reporting requirements imposed on small businesses by Federal agencies. Requires each agency to review its reporting forms within such period and to propose and submit to Congress new forms to become effective on such date. Directs each agency to: (1) consult with small business representatives; (2) consider the impact of proposed forms on small businesses; and (3) reduce the number of forms previously required by 50 percent. Prohibits the use of any proposed form which is disapproved by either House of Congress within 60 calendar days of continuous session after submission. Implements the provisions of this title every seven years after the end of the initial three-year period. Exempts the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from specified provisions of this title. Requires the Commissioner of the IRS to: (1) review its reporting forms; (2) eliminate any forms which require responses by small businesses more than once each year; (3) propose new forms; (4) reduce the number of forms required; (5) consult small business representatives; and (6) report to Congress every two years on action taken to implement these provisions. Title II: Pilot Testing Programs - Requires specified reporting forms required by a final rule to be distributed to a selected cross sample of small businesses in a pilot test survey. Specifies the information to be solicited through such survey which includes: (1) a description of any problems the respondent encounters in completing form requirements; and (2) an identification of any requirements which duplicate requirements of other forms. Directs each agency to: (1) maintain a file of survey responses; and (2) publish the problems identified through the survey and the planned agency actions to alleviate such problems. Subjects the reporting forms to the provisions of the Federal Reports Act and requires the submission of all forms to the Office of Advocacy in the Small Business Administration. Makes it the responsibility of the Office of Management and Budget to oversee the implementation of this Act and to certify that reporting forms submitted to Congress are not duplicative of existing forms."
