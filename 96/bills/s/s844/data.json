States that employees entitled to Indian preference and military preference shall be retained in preference to employees entitled to only military preference during reductions in force within the BIA or the IHS. Declares that reassignments of individuals within the BIA or the IHS shall not be subject to the Indian preference laws where the Commissioner of Indian Affairs determines that the reassignment is necessary to: (1) assure the health or safety of an individual or his family; (2) avoid the displacement of an Indian during a reduction in force; or (3) prevent the deterioration of an individual's operation or of a necessary service to the Indian people. Forbids the application of Indian preference laws to any personnel action respecting an individual if the tribal organization served by the unit in which the position exists grants a waiver of those laws. Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and of Health, Education, and Welfare to report annually to Congress on their actions to recruit and train Indians for positions subject to Indian preference laws and to place non-Indian employees of the BIA and the IHS in other Federal positions."
