Requires State or local interests to pay half of the costs of such projects (instead of the total costs). Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, to provide planning support to rural water associations. Amends the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to pay for water storage included in any reservoir constructed under such Act. Increases the percentage of the total costs of such reservoir project applicable to water storage."
