    "text": "(Reported jointly to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs with amendment (without written report)) Reform of Federal Regulation Act of 1979 -=Title I: The Analysis, Planning and Management of Regulatory Functions= - Requires each Federal agency to publish for each proposed major rule, as such rule is defined in this Act, an initial regulatory analysis which describes the need for the rule, at least two available alternative approaches, and the economic and social effects of the proposed rule and alternatives. Requires each agency to provide interested persons 40 days after the initial analysis is published to submit written comments on such analysis, and to provide 20 additional days for persons to respond to such comments. Directs each agency to publish for each adopted major rule a final regulatory analysis which includes a justification of the selection of the final rule, a summary of significant public comments received on the initial analysis, and the agency's assessment of such comments. Specifies a number of factors each agency should consider when preparing a regulatory analysis, including: (1) the use of design versus performance standards; (2) the impact of the rule on productivity, competition, small businesses, and geographic regions; and (3) the paperwork impact of the rule. Specifies conditions under which the agency head may waive requirements for an initial or final regulatory analysis. Bars such analyses from judicial review. Authorizes an agency to use such written and oral procedures as it deems necessary to resolve controversies during consideration of a major rule. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to report to Congress and the public on the agency actions to implement this title. Requires each agency to: (1) include in the announcement of a rulemaking or adjudication the date by which the agency intends to complete such proceeding; and (2) to report annually to the Administrative Conference of the United States, the Congress, and the public on its regulatory activities of the past fiscal year. Stipulates that such report include: (1) the number of agency proceedings which the agency failed to complete by the established deadline and the reasons for such failure; (2) any changes the agency made to improve its regulatory actions; (3) a statement of the number of rules promulgated, modified, amended, or repealed by the agency during such year; (4) agency plans to reduce or simplify its rules; (5) the number of and citations to judicial actions challenging the validity of any agency rule; (6) a description of the use of funds by that agency to procure the services of a consultant pursuant to an appointment authorized or a contract awarded for the preparation of any document for use in the performance of a regulatory function of that agency; and (7) a description of the regulatory priorities of the agency for the current fiscal year. Directs each regulatory agency to establish an office to be responsible for the actual planning and management of regulatory activities, or the oversight of such planning and management. Directs the President to establish within the Executive Office of the President a United States Regional Council to: (1) identify overlapping, conflicting, or duplicative agency rules and single areas of the economy or State and local governments significantly affected by the cumulative impact of Federal rules; (2) organize interagency task forces to alleviate such problems; (3) publish information regarding the regulatory goals and activities of agencies; and (4) consult with State and local governments to identify and reduce conflicting, overlapping, or duplicative rules of Federal agencies and such governments. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review and report to the President and Congress on agency compliance with this Title. Requires any independent regulatory commission to submit any budget information or legislative recommendation to Congress concurrently upon submission to any officer or agency of the executive branch. Authorizes the head of every Federal agency to utilize State or local government regulations, procedures, or reporting requirements if they duplicate Federal requirements and are consistent with the goals of Federal statutes. =Title II: Improving the Efficiency of Administrative Proceedings= - Requires that the general statement published with each rule adopted by an agency include a response to significant issues raised by public comments received concerning the rule. Directs each agency to maintain a file of major paperwork for each informal rulemaking proceeding. Establishes a new procedure for administrative adjudications and rulemaking required by statute to be determined on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing, with specified exceptions. Provides two levels for the conduct of such proceedings. Allows an agency to utilize a \"general hearing process\" for any proceeding predominantly concerning general policy issues rather than specific factual questions, excluding any proceeding: (1) to impose civil penalties; (2) to establish that a person has committed a culpable violation of law; or (3) to determine claims for certain benefits.
