    "text": "Affirmative Action Program Improvements Act of 1980 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to exempt contractors or subcontractors who employed and will employ five or fewer employees at all times within the 12-month period preceding the awarding of and at all times during the term of a Federal contract, or a subcontract with a Government contractor, from provisions included in any Executive order relating to equal employment opportunities, or agency regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, that require Government contractors or subcontractors to carry out affirmative action programs or activities. Directs the Secretary of Labor, through the United States Employment Service, to develop and implement a program to identify potentially qualified applicants and minority-owned businesses in connection with the affirmative action obligations of Government contractors and subcontractors. Declares that, beginning six months after the effective date of this Act, any Government contractor or subcontractor shall satisfy affirmative action obligations and objectives under any applicable Executive order relating to equal employment opportunities or agency regulation promulgated pursuant to any Executive order, plan, or agreement by: (1) making a reasonable, good faith effort to obtain employment referrals (except with respect to managerial, professional, and supervisory positions) and subcontractor referrals from the Service and to employ qualified applicants and contract with qualified subcontractors so referred; (2) complying with specified requirements; (3) complying with reasonable affirmative action obligations with respect to promotion and training opportunities; and (4) maintaining and submitting necessary records."
