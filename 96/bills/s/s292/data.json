Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to withhold all or part of a State's administrative expense funds for the school lunch and other child nutrition programs if serious deficiencies in a State program are found but not corrected. Authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Defense to provide the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children to certain Armed Forces dependents and other Department of Defense personnel located outside the United States. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for such program. Limits participation in the summer food service program to public service institutions, private nonprofit service institutions, private nonprofit schools, private nonprofit institutions primarily serving migrant children, and certain other nonprofit service institutions. Provides for the administration of the program by each State."
