  "summary": {
    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1980-10-01", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act) to extend through fiscal year 1982 authorizations of appropriations for: (1) various research, investigative, training, and information programs; (2) treatment works pilot training programs; (3) employment needs forecasting; (4) grants for pollution control programs; (5) training grants and contracts; (6) undergraduate scholarships; (7) areawide waste treatment management planning process grants; (8) agricultural cost sharing for rural nonpoint source pollution control; (9) clean lakes grants to States; and (10) carrying out such Act, with the exception of specified provisions. Repeals specified limitations and conditions on grants under such Act for the construction of treatment works which required that: (1) the applicant make provision for receiving payment from industrial users of the treatment works for that portion of the Federal share of the construction cost of such works allocable to industrial wastes treatment; (2) the grantee retain a specified portion of such revenues; and (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency be authorized to exempt certain industrial users from such payments. Repeals provisions for such payments for treatment works by industrial users to the United States in the case of privately owned treatment works. Makes other technical and conforming amendments to such Act. Repeals provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1977 which provided for a moratorium on such payments for treatment works by industrial users. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, grants made under the Clean Water Act after November 15, 1981, for a publicly owned treatment work, other than for facility planning and the preparation of contruction plans and specifications, from being used to treat, store, or convey the flow of any industrial user into such treatment works in excess of a flow per day equivalent to 50,000 gallons of sanitary waste. Exempts from such prohibition any project proposed by a grantee carrying out an approved project to prepare construction plans and specifications for a wastewater treatment facility which received its grant approval before May 15, 1980. Directs the Administrator to study and report to Congress on the effect of such prohibition of such grants upon the construction of publicly owned treatment works, treatment of industrial discharges, and the appropriate degree of Federal and non-Federal participation in the funding of publicly owned treatment works. Revises conditions under which the Administrator is authorized to pay the Federal share of the cost of advanced construction on publicly owned treatment works in cases where a State allotment has been obligated under specified provisions. Prohibits the Administrator from approving an application for such additional funds unless an authorization is in effect for the first fiscal year in the period for which the application requests payment and such requested payment for that fiscal year does not exceed the State's expected allotment from such authorization. Declares that the Administrator shall not be required to make such requested payment for any fiscal year: (1) to the extent such payment would exceed the State allotment of the amount appropriated; and (2) unless such payment is for a project eligible, on the basis of a State approved funding priority list, to receive such payment based on the allotment and appropriation. Directs the Administrator to reduce the Federal share for such projects to the extent that sufficient funds are not appropriated. Increases the construction costs limitations applicable to the combined grant procedure for small projects to $4,000,000 (and to $5,000,000 in States with unusually high construction costs). Extends by one year (from 24 months to 36 months) the period during which sums allotted to States under such Act may be obligated. Provides for reallotment after such period. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) notify the Congress whenever the unobligated balance of a revolving fund in the Treasury (for the removal of discharged oil or hazardous substances, or of maritime disaster discharges, and the recovery of such removal costs) is less than $12,000,000; and (2) include a recommendation for a supplemental appropriation relating to sums needed to maintain such fund at the currently authorized $35,000,000 level. Authorizes a State Governor, with the concurrence of the Administrator, to reduce the Federal share for wastewater treatment works construction grants from the standard 75 percent to a lower percentage uniform throughout such State. Directs the Administrator to issue guidelines for concurrence in such modification, providing for the consideration of specified factors. Permits a similar reduction of the standard 85 percent Federal share of specified grants for wastewater treatment works utilizing innovative or alternative processes and techniques, but limits such reduction to a percentage rate no less than 15 percent greater than the modified uniform percentage rate for such State. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enter into contracts and other agreements with the State of New York to carry out a project to demonstrate methods for selective removal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) contaminating bottom sediments of the Hudson River, treating such sediments as required, burying such sediments in secure landfills, and installing monitoring systems for such landfills. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants for 75 percent of the cost of such Hudson River PCB reclamation project. Requires non-Federal sources to provide the remainder of such costs. Prohibits the Administrator from obligating or expending more than $20,000,000 to carry out such project. Provides that the two percent of construction grant funds which may be used by the States for program administraion is to be based on the authorized grant amount (rather than the amount actually appropriated). Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to undertake a demonstration program for the cleanup of State-owned abandoned mines which can be used as hazardous waste disposal sites. Requires that the State pay ten percent of project costs. Directs the Secretary to undertake such projects, at a minimum, in the States of Ohio, Illinois, and West Virginia. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal years 1982 through 1984."
