Requires such an alternate budget if the level of expenditures or receipts exceeds 20 percent of the gross national product in any fiscal year thereafter. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to direct the Budget Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate to report such an alternate budget with the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 and thereafter if the reported levels of outlays or revenues exceed the percentages of the gross national product set forth above. Requires the accompanying report to explain the differences between the alternate and the budget resolution. Requires the Congress to consider the alternate budget resolution separately, and before the concurrent resolution for which it is an alternate."
