    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to any municipality or intermunicipal or interstate agency, either directly or through the appropriate State if so requested by the State, for the construction of publicly owned treatment works which: (1) are required to be constructed under the provisions of a court order; (2) serve an area which constitutes, or is part of, a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area; and (3) are estimated to cost in excess of $250,000,000 in order to meet court-ordered requirements. Requires such grants to be equal to 75 percent of the costs of construction. Prohibits such grant from being made unless each such State upon whose priority list such project appears has expended or obligated at least 25 percent of its allotment for such fiscal year for such project. Requires the Administrator to establish a timetable for making such grants so as to best provide for compliance with the court-ordered timetable for construction of the required treatment works."
