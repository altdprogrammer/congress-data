Limits the amount of expenditures eligible for the credit to those research and experimental expenditures which exceed 102 percent, but which do not exceed 150 percent, of the expenditures for the preceding taxable year. Allows a three year carryback and a seven year carryover of credit amounts which exceed the limitations on the credit for any taxable year."
