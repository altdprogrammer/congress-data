States that grants under such title shall be to extend and improve services: (1) to reduce infant mortality and otherwise promote the health of mothers, infants, children, and adolescents; (2) to prevent disease and disability that cripple children and to locate, diagnose, treat, and provide followup services for children who have crippling conditions or who suffer conditions which may lead to crippling; and (3) for locating and identifying mothers, infants, children, adolescents, and crippled children.

Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a study of such formulas and to report to Congress on such study. Sets forth the requirements for a State plan of maternal and child and crippled childrens' services. Includes requirements for: (1) the establishment of a State advisory council to be appointed by the Governor of the State to advise the State agency administering the plan in matters of policy, consolidation of health care programs in the State, identification of mothers and children in need of care, and bringing care to them; (2) that when services are available in the community, the State health agency shall reimburse an individual practitioner or other private health entity for medical services rendered; (3) for the development of a unified State plan for mothers, infants, children, and adolescents by the maternal and child health and crippled children's program; (4) that the maternal and child health program and the crippled children's program will include basic programs and services as determined by the State advisory council, and a series of special programs and projects; and (5) for the State agency to submit a report annually to the Director of the National Office of Maternal and Child Health Services on the activities conducted pursuant to the State plan. Directs the Secretary to pay, subject to certain stipulations, 75 percent of a State's total expenditures under a plan developed in accordance with this Act.

Limits any single grant for such projects to $2,000,000 annually. Authorizes the Secretary to make available from the special grants for underserved counties and local areas up to 75 percent of the cost of programs which: (1) help to reduce the incidence of mental retardation and other handicapping conditions caused by complications associated with child bearing and help to reduce infant and maternal mortality; (2) help to promote the health of preschool and school age children; and (3) foster comprehensive health care for youth and otherwise provide for care, treatment, and counseling for conditions associated with pregnancy, venereal disease, alcoholism, drug addiction, and mental health.
