States that greater independence in domestic energy supplies is necessary to national defense preparedness. Prohibits the President from instituting a gasoline rationing program without Congressional approval. Designates \"energy\" as a \"strategic and critical material.\" States that such designation shall not give the President any authority: (1) for the mandatory allocation or pricing of any fuel or feedstock; or (2) to engage in the production of energy in any manner whatsoever, except for synthetic fuel production. Transfers authority to the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and Energy to guarantee loans for the purpose of expediting deliveries or services with respect to national defense contracts. Increases the maximum amount of a loan which any Federal agency may guarantee under the Defense Production Act of 1950, without the approval of Congress, from $20,000,000 to $38,000,000.

Authorizes the agency involved to guarantee such a loan if neither House of Congress disapproves of the loan within a specified time period. Increases the discretionary direct loan authority from $25 to $48 million. Expands Presidential authority to provide for the national defense by authorizing the President to make provision for the production of strategic minerals, metals, and materials. Extends the purchasing authority of this Act until September 30, 1995.

Restricts purchases, pursuant to the preceding sentence, from any one person to no more than 100,000 barrels daily. Provides for competitive bidding in the purchase of synthetic fuel. Limits Federal authority to purchase synthetic fuel (when there is no national energy shortage) to 100,000 barrels per day crude oil equivalent of synthetic fuel. Provides that only synthetic fuel produced in the United States may be purchased. Requires the President, in the consideration of any proposed contract, to take into account the socioeconomic impact on communities which would be affected by any new or expanded facilities required for synthetic fuel production under the contract. Provides that any synthetic fuel acquired by the Government and which is not used to meet national defense needs or used to meet the storage requirements of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve shall be sold. Provides that, for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, no action in providing any loan, guarantee, or purchase agreement for synfuels shall be deemed to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
