    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-1126) Central Idaho Wilderness Act of 1980 - Designates areas around the Salmon River in Idaho as the River of No Return Wilderness under the provisions of the Wilderness Act of 1964. Incorporates certain lands of the Bitterroot National Forest, Idaho, and deems such lands to be part of, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness under the provisions of the Wilderness Act. Abolishes the previous classifications of the Idaho and Salmon River Breaks Primitive Areas. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within three years after the date of enactment of this Act, to develop and submit to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs a comprehensive wilderness management plan for the River of No Return Wilderness which shall consider a broad range of land uses and recreation opportunities. Requires such plan to address the need for, and alternative means of access to, the wilderness and to include a report from the Secretary of Defense to the Congress on the strategic significance of the materials and minerals found in such wilderness. Subjects to specified conditions the mining of any minerals within a mining claim located before or after the date of enactment of this Act within the portion of land designated as the River of No Return Wilderness. Permits, within the River of No Return Wilderness and the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the continuation of: (1) the landing of aircraft and the grazing of livestock established prior to the date of enactment of this Act and subject to restrictions of the Secretary of Agriculture; (2) commercial services performed to the extent necessary for activities which are proper for realizing the recreational or other purposes of the areas; and (3) the future construction and maintenance of small hydroelectric generators, domestic water facilities, and related facilities in specified areas along the Salmon River. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and with agencies and institutions of the State of Idaho to conduct a cultural resource management program within the River of No Return Wilderness. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a cultural resources management plan for such wilderness which shall: (1) encourage scientific research into man's past use of the River of No Return Wilderness and the Salmon River corridor; (2) provide an outline for the protection of significant cultural resources; (3) be based on adequate inventory data; (4) include a public interpretation program; and (5) comply with all Federal and State historic and cultural preservation statutes, regulations, guidelines and standards. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and with agencies and institutions of Idaho to conduct an inventory of the ranch, homestead, trapper and other cabins, and structures within the River of No Return Wilderness and to submit a report to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs concerning such survey. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate specified segments of the Salmon River as additions to the national wild and scenic rivers system. Permits the use of motorboats within such segments to continue at a level not less than the level of use which occurred during calendar year 1978. Declares that such segment of the Salmon River designated by this Act shall be managed under the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Prohibits dredge and placer mining in any form including any use of any kind of machinery for the removal of sand and gravel for mining purposes in specified segments of the river. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to render, within 30 days from the date of enactment of this Act, a final administrative decision on any and all administrative appeals pending before him on the date of enactment of this Act with regard to the following land management plans: (1) The Warren Planning Unit Land Management Plan and Final Environmental Statement; and (2) The Landmark Planning Unit Land Management Plan and Final Environmental Statement."
