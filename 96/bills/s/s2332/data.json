Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for storage, disposal, or transportation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste until operating procedures are established. Provides that certain anticipated revenues from uranium enrichment activities are authorized to be appropriated to DOE for specified purposes. Authorizes the appropriation, for DOE civilian plant and capital equipment projects initiated prior to fiscal year 1981, of amounts not in excess of the Federal share of the cost of each project stated in fiscal year 1981 budget documents. Stipulates that for fiscal year 1981 additional budget authority is authorized for a certain solar energy project in Colorado and a certain uranium production project in Ohio. Directs the Secretary to evaluate, in accordance with specified guidelines, the two high Btu coal gasification demonstration plant projects, and to construct and operate the projects if found to be satisfactory. Authorizes appropriations for a certain safety research project in Idaho and a certain advanced isotope separation pilot plant facility in Washington. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981, in addition to amounts already authorized under this Act for operating expenses for civilian program initiatives, for: (1) energy conservation; (2) energy production, demonstration and distribution; (3) standby motor fuel rationing; (4) the Geothermal Resources Development Fund; and (5) the strategic petroleum reserve. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for fossil energy operating expenses to continue design work on the coal gasification project not selected for construction, if determined that the project would be of value in contributing toward attaining the President's goals for the domestic production of alternative fuels. Authorizes appropriations for two demonstration plants for fossil energy construction relating to coal (one in West Virginia and one in Kentucky). Authorizes appropriations, from funds available under the fossil energy research and development appropriation, for projects to demonstrate technology for the upgrading of heavy oil, tar sands material, and residual oils. Authorizes the expenditure of funds, within the amounts appropriated under this Act for plant and capital equipment, for specified new plant and capital equipment activities in the following areas: (1)fossil energy; (2) energy supply research and development; (3) science and research; (4) uranium supply and enrichment; and (5) departmental administration. Terminates, effective October 1, 1981, 1,000 positions currently allocated by the Secretary of Energy to carry out programs established under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to extend the period of automatic preemption of State energy efficiency standards for certain consumer products until a Federal standard for each appliance is prescribed. Requires the Department of Energy to maintain during each month a list of contracts entered into within the preceding 24 months or for which contractors have not yet completed performance. Directs the Secretary to require that each report prepared by a contractor, and each report prepared by an agency which is substantially derived from or substantially includes any such report, shall include specified information. =Title II: Out-Year Authorization= - Authorizes appropriations, in accordance with those provisions of the DOE Organization Act which provide that appropriations to carry out that Act shall be subject to annual appropriations, as follows: (1) for the operating expenses of DOE civilian programs, in the amount appropriated for each appropriation account for the previous year, plus ten percent; and (2) for general plant projects and acquisition and fabrication of capital equipment not related to construction for DOE civilian programs, in the amount appropriated for each appropriation account for the previous year, plus ten percent. Requires a separate authorization for any DOE civilian program operating expenses request in excess of the amount authorized for an appropriation account. Requires, for each fiscal year beyond 1981, new plant and capital equipment projects to be specifically authorized on a line item basis. =Title III: Energy Impact Assistance= - Energy Impact Assistance Act of 1980 - Amends the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to authorize State Governors or Indian tribal governing bodies to designate energy impacted areas in accordance with specified conditions concerning increases in employment, population, use of public services and facilities, and lack of financial resources to meet needs for such increased use of services and facilities resulting from the existence of a major energy development in such areas. Directs the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor, the Interior, and Agriculture, to approve any designation of an energy impacted area. Requires State Governors and Indian tribal governing bodies to designate local planning units to prepare mitigation plans for each such energy impact area. Requires a mitigation plan to: (1) identify the projected impact of each major energy development on the economy of such area and the specific needs within such area for public facilities and services resulting from the development; (2) contain assurances that the proceeds from any repayment of loans made by a State or Indian tribe under this Act will be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury; (3) provide for the revision of such plans; and (4) be coordinated with planning assisted or required under the Act or any other appropriate Federal statute. Requires such plans to be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture.
