    "text": "Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to authorize the Council of the District of Columbia to enact legislation which concerns the functions of the United States if such functions relating to the District are performed by Federal officers or employees pursuant to an Act of Congress. Makes this provision applicable to Acts passed by the Council on or after April 22, 1980. Provides that the limitations on the Council for enactment of legislation with respect to the organization and jurisdiction of District of Columbia Courts shall not be construed as restricting its authority to provide by law the extent of such courts' jurisdiction to review orders and decisions of the Mayor, the Council, or any District agency. Declares that, though the Council has no authority to tax non-residents of the District, such restriction shall not be construed as prohibiting it from imposing a tax on incorporated or unincorporated businesses trading in the District. Directs that the limitations on the legislative authority of the Council be strictly construed in a manner consistent with the congressional purposes of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act."
