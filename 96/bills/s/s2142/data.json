Allows the Secretary of the Interior, upon the request of a Village Corporation, to waive the requirement of such Act which requires that a Corporation select land in whole sections (and that natural features are to be used as boundaries) where such waiver is justified and appears to be beneficial. Provides for reconveyances of less than 1,280 acres by a Village Corporation to a Municipal Corporation or the State in trust. Makes provisions for the conveyance of real property by a Village Corporation to shareholders of such Corporation to provide homesites. Stipulates that the basis of any land or mineral or timber interest received pursuant to this Act shall not be less than the fair value of such interest at the time of the first commercial development.

Includes provisions for: (1) the issuance of an \"interim conveyance\" to the party entitled to lands to be conveyed to a Native, Native corporation, or Native group pursuant to this Act, if such lands have not been surveyed; (2)the selection of additional land by a Village Corporation where the lands selected and conveyed are insufficient to fulfill the Corporation's entitlement; (3) the selection of additional land by Regional Corporations where the public lands consist only of the mineral estate; and (4) the conveyance of surface title of existing cemetery and historical places to appropriate Regional Corporations. Disentitles any Regional Corporation, which asserts a claim with the Secretary, to certain subsurface estates of lands selected under such Act which are in a Wildlife Refuge. Authorizes such corporation to select from any in lieu surface or subsurface estate. Requires that any such claim must be asserted within 180 days after enactment.

Sets forth administrative provisions concerning the extension of the moratorium on State taxation of undeveloped and unimproved lands. Specifies that no land conveyed to a Native Corporation pursuant to this Act which is within a contingency area designated in a timber sale contract let by the United States shall be subject to such contract or to entry or timbering by the contractor, until such Native Corporation: (1) has received conveyances to all of the land to which it is entitled; and (2) agrees to such timbering. Title II: Other Related Provisions - Directs the Secretary to pay by grant to certified Native Group Corporations an amount not more than $100,000 or less than $50,000 for planning, development, or other authorized purposes.
