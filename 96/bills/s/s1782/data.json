Requires such organization to file quarterly reports concerning such lobbying activities including: (1) an estimate of the total expenditures made for lobbying communications; (2) the identification of retainees and certain employees of the organization who make lobbying communications and the expenditures made pursuant to retaining or employing such persons; and (3) a description of the issues for which such organization has lobbied. Specifies duties of the Comptroller General concerning the management of such disclosed information which include making copies of each registration and report required by this Act available for public inspection and copying. Sets forth procedures for the enforcement of this Act. Authorizes a court to require the United States to pay the attorney fees and other litigation costs incurred by an organization which substantially prevails in any action brought pursuant to this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to transmit to the President and Congress annual reports on activities of the Comptroller General under this Act. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of provisions of this Act. Declares that no action to enforce any violation of this Act may be maintained unless brought within three years after the violation occurred. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act.
