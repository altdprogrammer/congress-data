    "text": "Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to transfer from the Secretary of Labor to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency the responsibility for determining whether the level and type of pesticides and other chemicals used in the harvesting of certain crops with particularly short harvesting seasons may cause a significant adverse effect on the health or well-being of the child agricultural laborers ages ten or eleven to whom a waiver of specified child labor provisions would apply. Continues to prohibit the Secretary from granting such a waiver if such a determination of adverse effect is made. Specifies that the requirement that such waiver only be granted if such employment would not be deleterious to such individuals' health or well-being is satisfied by the submission of signed statements from trained medical personnel in the affected region."
