    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1980-12-11", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) =Title I: Amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act= - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to make the Secretary of Agriculture responsible for the administration of the North Fork of the American River in the State of California. Designates specified segments of the following rivers for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system: (1) Myakka, Florida; (2) Saint Lucie, Florida; (3) Salmon, Connecticut; (4) Farmington, Connecticut; (5) Parker, Massachusetts; (6) Caney Fork, Tennessee; (7) Dan, North Carolina and Virginia; (8) Satilla River, Georgia; (9) Cimarron, Kansas; (10) Hoh, Washington; (11) Dosewallips, Washington; (12) Quillayute, Washington; (13) Wood, Rhode Island; (14) Black, Wisconsin; and (15) Humptulips, Washington. Sets forth the dates by which the studies of such rivers shall be completed. Authorizes appropriations for the purpose of conducting such studies. Requires the Study of the Farmington River, Connecticut, to include an analysis of whether low-head hydroelectric generating facilities can be installed on such river at dams existing on the date of enactment of this Act without having a direct and adverse effect upon the fish, wildlife, recreational, and aesthetic values of the river. Requires the study of the Salmon River and the Farmington River, Connecticut, and the Hoh River, Dosewallips River, and Quillayute River, in Washington, to include an analysis of the various means which may be practicable and appropriate, consistent with other provisions of this Act, to maintain and enhance the fisheries resources of such rivers. Specifies that no permits or licenses currently approved for mining and related activities permitted on the Myakka River, Florida, shall be affected for the duration of the study of such river. Designates specified segments of the following rivers as components of the national wild and scenic rivers system: (1) the Illinois River in the State of Oregon; and (2) the Dosewallips River in the State of Washington. Requires the agency charged with the administration of each designated component of the national wild and scenic rivers system to establish detailed boundaries therefor and determine which class outlined in such Act best fits the river or its various segment, within one year from the date of designation of such component (formerly within one year from the date of such Act). Eliminates the requirement that such an agency prepare a plan for the necessary developments in connection with the administration of such a river. Requires an agency charged with the administration of each such component, within specified time periods, to prepare a comprehensive protection and management plan to guide the agency's administration in accordance with the classification made under such Act. Requires that such plan: (1) include the identification of and plans for implementation of user carrying capacities for all types of public use activities within the boundaries of the river; and (2) be prepared after consultation with State and local governments and the interested public. Limits the authority to enter into contractual agreements and to make payments under this Act pursuant to such contractual agreements to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. =Title II: Amendments to the National Trails System Act= - National Trails System Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the National Trails System Act to declare that it is a purpose of such Act to encourage and assist volunteer citizen involvement in the planning, development, and management of trails. Specifies that national scenic trails may be located so as to include, but need not be limited to, desert, marsh, grassland, mountain, canyon, river, or forest areas, as well as landforms which exhibit significant characteristics of the physiographic regions of the Nation. Permits trails on privately owned lands to be designated \"National Recreation Trails\" by the Secretary of the Interior with the consent of the landowners. Designates the following as national scenic and historic trails: (1) Santa Fe National Historic Trails; (2) Chisholm, Shawnee, and Western National Historic Trails; (3) Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail; (4) Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail; and (5) Florida National Scenic Trail. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, where lands administered by either of such Secretaries are involved, to submit studies concerning the suitability of trail designations to specified Congressional committees based on an evaluation of whether it is physically possible to develop a trail along a route being studied, and, if so, whether the development of the trail would be financially feasible. Directs the appropriate Secretary, if during the course of such study it is determined that is not feasible to develop a national scenic or national historic trail along the proposed route and that there is no significant need for such trail, to submit a report containing such determination to specified Congressional committees. Requires the Secretary, before submitting any such report containing a recommendation against designation of a trail, to examine: (1) whether the route affords an opportunity to commemorate a significant event in the development of the Nation or the region or to memorialize an individual whose activities had a far reaching on the development thereof; and (2) whether any segments of the route have the potential to be developed as national recreation trails. Directs that the following trails be studied for consideration for designation as national scenic trails: (1) the Juan Bautista de Anza Trail in the State of California; (2) the Trail of Tears in the States of North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma; (3) the Illinois Trail in the State of Illinois; (4) the Jedediah Smith Trail in the States of Wyoming, California, Utah, and Washington; (5) the General Crook Trail in the State of Arizona; and (6) the Beale Wagon Road in the State of Arizona. Requires that a report to specified Congressional committees by the appropriate Secretary concerning a comprehensive management plan for a designated national historic trail pursuant to such Act include: (1) a protection plan for any high potential routes or high potential historic sites; and (2) general and site-specific development plans, including anticipated costs. Permits connecting or side trails, when no Federal land acquisition is involved, to be located on privately owned lands with the consent of the landowner. Directs the Secretary charged with the overall administration of any national scenic or national historic trail, in administering and managing the trail, to consult with the heads of all other affected State and Federal agencies. Permits the Secretary charged with the overall administration of any such trail to transfer management of any specified trail segment of such trail to the other appropriate Secretary pursuant to a joint memorandum of agreement containing such terms and conditions as the Secretaries consider most appropriate to accomplish the purposes of such Act. Permits the appropriate Secretary to provide for trail interpretation sites, which shall be located at historic sites along the route of any national scenic or national historic trail, in order to present information to the public about the trail, with emphasis on that portion of the trail passing through the State in which the center is located. Specifies that, whenever possible, such sites shall be maintained by a State agency under a cooperative agreement between the appropriate Secretary and the State agency. Authorizes the appropriate Secretary, when a tract of land lies partly within and partly without a national scenic or national historic trail right-of-way, to acquire the entire tract with the consent of the owner. Permits the United States to utilize condemnation proceedings or any other form of eminent domain power without the consent of the owner to acquire any lands or interests in lands which are designated as protect components of a trail system. Provides that written cooperative agreements with States or their political subdivisions, landowners, private organizations, or individuals to operate, develop, and maintain any portion of a national scenic or national historic trail may include provisions for limited financial assistance to encourage participation in such activities and provisions for providing volunteer in the park or volunteer in the forest status in accordance with the Volunteers in the Parks Act of 1969 and the Volunteers in the Forests Act of 1972. Permits the Secretary, for the administration of any segment of any component of the National Trails System, to utilize authorities related to units of the national park system or the national forests in carrying out the administrative responsibilities for such component. Specifies certain activities as potential trail uses allowed on designated components of the national trails system, except where otherwise provided in this Act or in other Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Secretary of the Interior to encourage State and local agencies and private interests to establish recreational trails. Authorizes the establishment of a volunteer action trails demonstration program to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to encourage the planning, development, and management by volunteers of all types of trails throughout the Nation. Permits each Secretary to make grants of not more than $25,000 to volunteer trail groups which are committed to managing, maintaining, or developing trails or which agree to conduct such activities. Limits the usage of such grants to: (1) developing or maintaining trails which are components of the National Trails System or trails which, if so developed and maintained by such groups, could qualify for designation as components of the National Trails System; or (2) operating programs to organize and supervise volunteer trail building efforts with respect to such trails, conducting trail-related research projects, or providing education and training to volunteers on methods of trail planning, construction, and maintenance. Prohibits any such grant from being made available to a volunteer trail group unless the group submits an application to the appropriate Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary from approving any such application unless: (1) the group agrees to provide funds or services pertaining to trails, the value of which is equal to the amount of the grant, and agrees to abide by such procedures as the Secretary may establish to ensure accountability for any funds made available to the group; and (2) the application specifies the manner in which the funds would be used. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Funds Act of 1965 to prohibit the imposition of any Federal fee for entrance or admission to any national recreation area, any unit of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, or any unit of the National Trails System. Prohibits, effective June 1, 1981, the imposition of any Federal fee for entrance or admission to any unit of the National Park System at which the receipts collected for entrance fees exceeded the cost of collection of said fees in 1979. =Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept a conveyance of specified land adjacent to the Effigy Mounds National Monument in Iowa and to convey, in exchange, to that grantor, without monetary consideration, specified land presently within the monument. =Title IV: John Sack Cabin= - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Fremont County Historical Society and other interested organizations, to provide for the protection and maintenance of the John Sack Cabin, Targhee National Forest, Idaho, and associated structures. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with, or to issue a special use permit to, an appropriate person or organization pursuant to which such person or organization shall provide such protection and maintenance."
