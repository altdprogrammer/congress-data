    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the heads of other departments affected by this Act, to issue and revise regulations from time to time relating to the trapping and capturing of mammals and birds on Federal lands. Requires that such regulations contain standards setting forth the type of trap determined by the Secretary to be the most humane capture method available and which minimizes the possibility of trapping mammals and birds not intended for capture. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct tests necessary to make such determination. Imposes a fine of $500 and/or imprisonment of up to one year for violations of such regulations. Establishes an advisory commission to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to traps designed or intended for use. Sets forth a procedure for the application and issuance of trapping permits. Imposes a fine of $5,000 and/or imprisonment of one year for the sale, shipment, or transport of any unapproved trap or any animal skin or hide or bird feathers taken in violation of this Act. Requires that traps placed on Federal lands be inspected and emptied every 24 hours in those areas designated by the Secretary. Imposes a fine of $5,000 and/or imprisonment of one year for the placement of an unapproved trap on Federal lands and for the failure to inspect and empty an approved trap every 24 hours. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with any affected State pursuant to which the Secretary shall assist such State to enable it to comply with the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General of the United States to pay an individual up to $10,000 for information and services concerning any violation of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. Authorizes appropriations for research into the development of humane methods of capture and control of wild mammals and birds."
