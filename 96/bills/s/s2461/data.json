Directs the President to establish a reserve stock of wheat of up to 4,000,000 metric tons. Authorizes the President to release such stocks on a donation or concessional sale basis to provide emergency food assistance to developing countries at any time that the domestic supply of wheat in the United States is so limited that quantities cannot be made available except for urgent humanitarian purposes, but any wheat removed for such purpose shall not be replaced. Exempts such reserve stock from limitations which may be imposed pursuant to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 and the Export Administration Act of 1969."
