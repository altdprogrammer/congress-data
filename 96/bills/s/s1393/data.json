    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) =Title I: Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program= - Amends the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 to designate the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the agency with the primary responsibilities to conduct and coordinate the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. Requires the Director of such agency to: (1) recommend to the President the role and responsibility of each appropriate Federal department, agency, and entity with respect to each object and element of the program; (2) provide for the cooperation and coordination with, and assistance to, interested governmental entities in all States; (3) compile by September 30, 1981, and update and submit to Congress annually a written program plan with budget options; and (4) recommend appropriate roles for other levels of government, individuals, and private organizations. Directs that the research elements of the program include the development techniques for the delineation of the potential effects of earthquakes, and their application on a regional basis. Authorizes the Director of the United States Geological Survey to issue an earthquake prediction or advisory as he deems necessary. Requires the Director to recommend specific actions to the State and local officials and residents of an area for which a prediction has been made. Includes within the mitigation elements of the program: (1) the transmittal to Congress by the Director of an intraagency coordination plan for earthquake hazard mitigation and response; and (2) the development and implementation by the Director of a preparedness plan for response to earthquake predictions which includes a prototype plan for a major metropolitan area with specific adaptations for other high risk metropolitan areas. Eliminates the reporting to Congress requirement when proposed action under such plan has not been initiated. Requires the Director to conduct and submit to Congress a study recommending amendments to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to include funding for the period of time following a validated earthquake prediction. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for: (1) the continuation of the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction and the Building Seismic Safety programs; (2) plans and preparedness for earthquake disasters; (3) prediction response planning; (4) architectural and engineering planning and practice programs; (5) development and application of a public education program; (6) earthquake policy research by the National Science Foundation; (7) use by the Center for Building Technology, National Bureau of Standards; (8) the United States Geological Survey; (9) the National Science Foundation; and (10) the National Bureau of Standards. Permits the transfer of funds between categories as specified. =Title II: Fire Prevention and Control= - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for: (1) a three-year concentrated demonstration program of fire prevention and control in two States with high fire death rates; (2) rural fire prevention and control; and (3) research and development activities at the Fire Research Center of the National Bureau of Standards. Establishes minimum amounts to be spent on such programs. =Title III: Multihazard Research, Planning, and Mitigation= - Authorizes the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to initiate studies to define and develop a multihazard research, planning, and implementation process within the Agency, develop prototype multihazard mitigation projects for State and local governments, and prepare a report on the status of the Agency's emergency information and communication satellites."
