    "date": "1980-03-20", 
    "text": "Amends the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior to carry out a pilot range improvement program in not more than six grazing districts. Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide technical and financial assistance to individual permittees or grazing associations for the performance of specified range improvement measures on public rangelands within such districts, including the installation of pipelines, fencing, grass seeding and ponds. Limits the Federal assistance to 80 percent of the actual costs incurred by such permittee or association. Makes such improvements the property of the United States, but conditions financial assistance upon the maintenance of such improvements by the permittees for their designated lifespan or the duration of their permits. Requires such improvements to be based upon a plan of range management and improvement. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to utilize specified government agencies in providing technical assistance under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to follow the recommendations of the Secretary of Agriculture when issuing permits for domestic livestock grazing on the public rangelands within the specified grazing districts. Exempts such districts from the force and effect of the final judgment of Natural Resources Defense Council vs. Morton. Directs both Secretaries to make annual reports to Congress on the program. States that this Act will expire at the end of fiscal year 1989."
