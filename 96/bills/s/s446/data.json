    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 96-316) Equal Employment Opportunity for Handicapped Individuals Act of 1979 - Amends title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to define \"handicap\" as the status of any person who: (1) has a mental or physical impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (2) has a record of such impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. Stipulates that such definition does not include an individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser. Makes unlawful certain labor practices of employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, and training programs which discriminate against the handicapped. Stipulates that it shall not be an unlawful labor practice to consider a handicap as a bona fide occupational qualification under specified employment and training situations. Stipulates that it shall not be an unlawful labor practice for an employer to: (1) use a bona fide seniority or merit system, or quantitative or qualitative system, to determine compensation or other employment conditions; or (2) employ appropriate ability tests, provided these actions are not intended or used to discriminate on the basis of handicap. Stipulates that such employers and training programs shall not be required to grant preferential treatment to handicapped individuals or groups to correct an existing imbalance. Stipulates that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for such employers and training programs to print or cause to be printed any notice or advertisement regarding such employment or training indicating any preference or discrimination based on handicap, except where handicap is a bona fide occupational qualification. Includes \"handicap\" within the categories for which a court may order reinstatement or back pay for violations of such Act. Prohibits discrimination of the handicapped in Federal employment. Authorizes civil actions by Federal employees for such discrimination. Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in implementing such Act with respect to handicapped persons, to coordinate its activities through the interagency committee (established under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) with other appropriate Federal agencies. Directs such Commission, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare, to make grants and enter into contracts to provide employers with technical assistance to assist them in complying with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (with regard to the handicapped). States that the provisions of this Act shall not be construed to affect the rights or remedies available under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Provides that the provisions of this Act shall become effective 12 months after enactment of such Act, except for those provisions dealing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and remedies under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which shall take effect immediately upon enactment."
