    "text": "Export Trade Activities Act - Exempts certified export trade associations from the antitrust laws as long as such associations do not restrain trade or competition in the United States. Gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether such associations comply with all requirements. Permits civil actions by injured parties if the Commission makes an affirmative determination. Sets forth the procedure for obtaining certification as an organization engaged solely in export trade. Requires the Commission and the Attorney General to publish guidelines for determining whether an association meets the requirements for antitrust exemption. Provides for the certification of existing associations. Requires certified associations to submit annual reports to the Commission. Authorizes the Commission or Attorney General to require associations to modify their operations to be consistent with U.S. international obligations. Repeals the Webb-Pomerene Act."
