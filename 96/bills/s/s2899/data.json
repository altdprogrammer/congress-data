    "text": "Establishes the Orange Coast National Urban Park in the State of California. Declares that it is the intention of Congress that all the property within the park be acquired by December 31, 1984, and that any lands, or interests therein not acquired by such date shall no longer be deemed included in the park. Declares that any land or interest therein owned by the State of California or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation or exchange. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to the property acquired pursuant to this Act, to: (1) convey the property to the State of California or any political subdivision thereof, subject to such terms, conditions, and reversionary provisions as will assure preservation of the property for public park or open-space purposes; and (2) enter into an agreement with the State or political subdivision thereof in order to protect and manage the property for public park or open-space purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands and interests therein within the boundaries of the park by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or otherwise, which authority is expressly conditioned upon certain events occurring within specified time periods. Directs the Secretary to convey and transfer such rights-of-way through the park as may be necessary for the establishment of the San Joaquin Hills transportation corridor. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to expeditiously take such actions as are required to construct the portion of such transportation corridor as is within the boundaries of the park."
