    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Amends the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act to remove the prohibition against Federal sharing of the cost of maintaining structures, devices, and other facilities constructed by States under a cooperative agreement for research and development in the conservation and enhancement of anadromous fishery resources. Provides that title to land acquired under such Act shall be in cooperating States or other non-Federal interests, instead of in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982 to carry out cooperative programs with the States for the conservation, development, and enhancement of anadromous fish. Stipulates that not more than $1,250,000 of the funds appropriated in any one fiscal year shall be obligated in any one State. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with States and other non-Federal interests in conducting studies of: (1) the size and distribution of the population of striped bass throughout its range; and (2) the factors responsible for the decline in the numbers of striped bass which are available to the public for recreational or commercial use. Directs the Secretary to make annual reports to Congress concerning the progress and findings of such studies. Authorizes additional appropriations for fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982 to carry out such studies. Directs the Secretary to inform Congress if such studies should be continued after September 30, 1982. Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to make a technical correction. Authorizes appropriations for preparing a plan for a fishery research laboratory in Washington, including the use of funds previously appropriated for the National Fishery Research Center in Washington. Specifies information to be included in such plan prior to being submitted to the appropriate congressional committees. Designates the aquarium to be built in Baltimore, Maryland, as the National Aquarium in Baltimore."
