Allows formula grants for fiscal year 1980 to be up to 100 percent of program costs and for subsequent fiscal years to be up to 90 percent of costs (unless budgetary restraints prevent the recipient from providing the remainder or in the case of Indian tribes or other aboriginal groups not having sufficient funds). Requires a formula grant recipient to assume the cost of improvements funded after a reasonable period of assistance, unless the Administrator determines that such recipient is unable to do so because of budgetary restraints. Requires the LEAA to allocate $200,000 (plus an additional amount of at least $50,000 with respect to judicial coordinating committees) for administrative purposes without a requirement for match to the State criminal justice councils, judicial coordinating committees, and local offices. Allows an additional 7.5 percent of a State's total allocation to be used for administrative costs. Defines the eligibility requirements for receiving formula grants. Includes a county or municipality which has a population of at least 100,000 and at least .15 percent of total State and local criminal justice expenditures, and any combination of contiguous local government units having a population of at least 100,000 (but only if such unit or combination would receive more than $50,000). Requires each State to designate by law and maintain a criminal justice council, appointed by the Governor, for the purposes of: (1) establishing and publishing priorities with respect to criminal justice problems; (2) preparing a comprehensive State application reflecting objectives and projected grant programs; (3) approving or disapproving, coordinating, and monitoring applications submitted by State agencies, the judicial coordinating committee, and local governments; (4) preparing an annual report for the Governor and State legislature; and (5) providing and performing other technical assistance, information services, auditing and evaluation, and related activities.

Authorizes the court of last resort of each State to designate a judicial coordinating committee (to replace the current judicial planning committees) for the purpose of preparing and submitting to the council a three-year application for court improvements. Directs the council to make available to such committee at least $50,000 of the assistance provided to such council for each fiscal year. Sets forth requirements for applications from councils to the LEAA (reducing the number of such requirements currently specified), including that planning statements be submitted triennially, instead of annually. Prohibits formula grants from being used for: (1) hardware acquisition, unless such purchase is an incidental and necessary part of a program of proven effectiveness or offering a high probability of improving the criminal justice system (including bulletproof vests); (2) general salary payments, except with respect to training or research; (3) construction projects; and (4) programs offering a low probability of improving the criminal justice system. Allocates 80 percent of total assistance to formula grants. Sets a minimum grant of $300,000 to each participating State, and bases the allocation of the balance on the larger yield of two formulas according to: (1) State population (the basis under current law); or (2) State population, crime rate, criminal justice expenditures, and State taxes. Allocates such funds to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands on the basis of population data only. Provides for State legislative review of council policies and priorities. Allocates ten percent of total assistance to \"National Priority\" grants for programs and projects which have been shown to be effective or innovative and to have a likely beneficial impact on criminal justice. Directs the Director of the OJARS and the Administrator of the LEAA to designate priorities jointly after evaluation by the NIJ, BJS, LEAA, State and local governments, and other public and private agencies. Provides that priority grants shall be 50 percent of program costs (except allocations made under two-part formula grants to equal a State's total allocation may pay 100 percent of such costs). Allows technical assistance to be 100 percent of costs. Allocates ten percent of total assistance for discretionary grants to State and local governments and private nonprofit organizations for programs and projects, including: (1) educational programs; (2) criminal justice planning and coordination; (3) creation of a comprehensive national strategy to combat white-collar crime and public corruption; (4) court and corrections improvements; (5) organized crime prevention; (6) community crime prevention; (7) disruption of illicit commerce in stolen goods; (8) victim-witness assistance programs; and (9) the development of criminal justice standards. Allows discretionary grants to be up to 100 percent of program costs. Directs the LEAA to grant assistance to those projects: (1) most clearly satisfying the priorities established by the OJARS and the LEAA; (2) in consideration of disproportionate allocations which may be found; and (3) after taking into account the problems and needs of all States. Authorizes priority and discretionary grants to be made for a period of three years and extended for an additional two years. Reauthorizes the Law Enforcement Education Program (LEEP), allowing the LEAA to establish: (1) training programs for State and local government attorneys engaged in the prosecution of white-collar and organized crime, and other State and local criminal justice personnel; and (2) academic educational assistance programs. Authorizes the Director of the FBI to conduct training programs and carry on other activities to improve criminal justice. Allows funds to be used for the transportation costs of trainees at the FBI National Academy. Establishes within the Department under the general authority and policy control of the Attorney General an Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and Statistics to provide staff support to, and coordinate the activities of, the LEAA, the NIJ, and the BJS. Provides for the appointment of the Director of the OJARS by the President. Requires the Director of the OJARS to submit: (1) within four years of the date of enactment to the congressional judiciary committees a report setting forth comprehensive statistics indicating whether the grant programs provided by this Act have made a reasonably expected contribution toward 18 specified criminal justice objectives; and (2) within 270 days of enactment a plan to analyze in objective terms progress in such areas. Sets forth administrative provisions which are generally comparable to current law, with certain exceptions, including revision of the content of the annual report to the President and Congress to require a description of equipment costing in the aggregate of $100,000 under the formula grant program and the current status of such equipment. Provides for appellate review of all denials of grant applications following the requisite administrative procedures. Establishes within the LEAA a revolving fund for the purpose of supporting projects that will acquire stolen goods and property to disrupt illicit commerce in such goods and property. Requires criminal intelligence systems operating through support under this title to conform with policy standards prescribed by the OJARS. Allows Federal funding of law enforcement activities in the District of Columbia to be used to provide non-Federal match requirements. Stipulates that the authority of any entity established under this title extends to only those civil justice matters bearing directly and substantially upon criminal justice matters. Authorizes the LEAA to require grantees to make reimbursement for equipment costing over $100,000 which is not put into use within one year. Exempts goods, wares, or merchandise manufactured, produced, or mined by convicts or prisoners participating in a program of not more than seven pilot projects designated by the Administrator of LEAA from the prohibition against the interstate commerce of convict labor and the Federal ban against sales to the Federal Government by State prison programs. Requires consultation with local labor union organizations. Stipulates that no employed or qualified workers in the locality be displaced before such exemptions apply.
