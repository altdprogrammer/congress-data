    "text": "Agricultural Commodity Export Suspension Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire and establish a reserve of any agricultural commodities the exports of which have been suspended for national security reasons by the President. Permits the Secretary to release any quantity of such commodities for purposes of rotation to avoid spoilage, famine relief, and conversion into alcohol for use as fuel. Directs the Secretary to announce an acreage set-aside program for such specified agricultural commodities for the following crop year in which an export suspension is expected to continue. Authorizes the Secretary to announce such an acreage set-aside program after the national program acreage for the next crop year for the affected commodity has been announced. Permits agricultural commodities suspended from export and subject to such set-aside program to be planted on otherwise set-aside acreage if: (1) such commodity is to be used in and is suitable for the manufacture of alcohol for use as fuel; and (2) there is adequate domestic demand for such alcohol."
