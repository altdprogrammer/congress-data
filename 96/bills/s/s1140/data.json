Renders the designation of a marine sanctuary, or any terms included therein, by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to such Act ineffective upon: (1) certification to the Secretary by the Governor of any State in which such designation is made that such designation or any of its terms are unacceptable to such State; or (2) adoption of a concurrent resolution by both Houses of Congress disapproving such designation or any of its terms. Sets forth terms to be included in such designations and authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to implement such terms and control the activities permitted under such designation. Directs the Secretary to conduct research to carry out the purposes of such Act. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to conduct enforcement activities to carry out the purposes of such Act. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Congress a marine sanctuary designation at the time of its publication. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for making such designations, and for research and enforcement."
