    "date": "1980-07-29", 
    "text": "Foreign Service Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1946 to establish a Foreign Service Schedule which shall apply to all members of the Foreign Service, who are U.S. citizens and whose salary is not otherwise specified (currently there are separate pay schedules for Foreign Service officers, reserve officers, staff officers, and employees). Provides for additional compensation to be paid to such members in a specified lump sum which shall be exempt from income taxation. Directs the Secretary of State to designate and classify positions in the Department, the Agency for International Development, the International Communication Agency (ICA), and positions at Foreign Service posts. Considers such positions to be subject to the civil service provisions. Requires the Secretary to assign diplomats to appropriate positions. Sets forth the qualifications to each one of the 13 salary classes established by this Act. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to list Foreign Service appointees on the registers of persons eligible for civil service employment. Makes such individuals eligible for civil service employment if their Foreign Service employment is terminated. Makes the civil service labor-management provision applicable to the Foreign Service. Authorizes certain members of the Foreign Service to join or refrain from joining labor organizations. Places the employees of the Department, the International Development Cooperation Agency, and the ICA in a single worldwide bargaining unit. Places members of the Foreign Service who are employees of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and the Treasury in a separate worldwide bargaining unit. Permits other civil service employees to merge with such units, if such units accept the merger. Increases the annuities of participants in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System. Provides additional annuity increases for participants who were held hostage."
