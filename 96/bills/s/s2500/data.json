Defines such costs as: (1) direct production costs allocable to the United States (including the cost of equipment, supplies, and compensation for services performed, but not cost of advertising and promotion); plus (2) if 80 percent or more of the direct production costs are allocable to the United States, all other production costs (including the cost of overhead, presentation rights, residuals, and participations) allocable outside the United States."
