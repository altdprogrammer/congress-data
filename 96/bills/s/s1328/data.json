Makes such additional funds available for the fiscal year for which such funds were authorized, and for the succeeding 12 months. Provides that any funds unobligated at the end of such period be allotted equally among the other States. Makes adjustments in the amount of additional funds allocated for a State where funds previously authorized proved inadequate. Authorizes appropriations for such additional funds. Sets the amount of funds authorized to be reserved each fiscal year to two percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for allotments to States under this program. Makes funds allotted to the States for fiscal years 1978 and 1979 available for the next succeeding 24 months. Provides for the reallotment of funds not obligated at the end of such period to all States except those which failed to obligate any of the funds being realloted. Stipulates that such realloted funds be in addition to those otherwise allotted to such State for grants under this program."
