    "text": "Sohio Pipeline Expediting Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue all remaining State and Federal permits necessary for construction and operation of the Long Beach-Midland crude oil transportation pipeline project from Long Beach, California, to Midland, Texas. Sets forth procedures for the application and issuance of permits not yet applied for by the project sponsor. Limits judicial review of actions taken by State and Federal officials to claims alleging denial of Federal constitutional rights. Sets forth an expedited procedure for judicial review of such actions, including the establishment of a statute of limitations, the granting of exclusive original jurisdiction to the United States district court in such cases, priority consideration on such court's docket of such cases, and the barring of injunctive relief against the issuance of any State or Federal permit except in specified circumstances. Stipulates that any review of an interlocutory or final judgment or other order of the district court may be had only upon direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to delete references to the Long Beach-Midland Project relating to waiver of Federal law, expedited procedures for issuance of permits, and judicial review."
