Denies such deduction to certain highly compensated participants in such plans who earn the equivalent of a least a GS-14 salary (and such compensation is higher than the wages and salaries of two-thirds of the other plan participants), unless the employer certifies that the plan complies with specified anti-discrimination standards."
