Withdraws minerals in Federal lands within such wilderness from appropriation under mining and mineral leasing laws, after 1985, subject to valid existing rights. Permits the continuation of (1) the use of aircraft or motorboats in such wilderness area subject to the restrictions of the Secretary of Agriculture; and (2) grazing of livestock established prior to the enactment of this Act, subject to regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture. Designates areas adjacent to such wilderness as Wilderness Study Areas. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement multipurpose resource development plans for Payette National Forest and Panther Creek Roadless Area. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to manage all the remaining roadless areas within the Nez Perce National Forest, not included in the wilderness area. Stipulates that such lands are in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act for purposes of commodity production, including timber harvest. Authorizes appropriations for forest road construction activities required by this Act."
