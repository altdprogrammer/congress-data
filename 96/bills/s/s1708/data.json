    "text": "Small Scale Energy Technology Programs Reorganization Act - Defines the term \"small-scale technology\" to include renewable energy and other technologies, products, and services which contribute to energy production, conservation, and awareness among end users in a manner which is simple, environmentally sound, and reliant upon available labor. Establishes and Office of Small Scale Technology within the Department of Energy. Requires the Office to incorporate the energy technology small grants program of the Department. Directs the Secretary of Energy, through the Director of such Office, to: (1) make grants to small businesses and localities for small-scale technology; (2) certify the performance of small-scale technology equipment and demonstration models developed by grantees; (3) assist in the marketing of certified technologies; (4) provide information on the benefits and availability of small-scale technology and the role of small business in its production; (5) assist State and local governments in the use of such technology; and (6) coordinate domestic and international small-scale technology programs. Sets forth procedures for the administration by the Office of the small grants program. Limits any such grant to not more than $100,000 for any two-year period. Directs the Secretary to initiate a program to promote the use of small-scale technology and to improve the competitive position of small, energy-related businesses. Requires the Secretary to provide grants to small businesses and localities to expand the use of certified technologies. Requires the Director to conduct and submit to Congress a study on the practicality of integrating all functions of the Energy-Related Inventions Program into the Office of Small Scale Technology. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress concerning: (1) policy recommendations to the Department for utilizing small-scale technologies to meet the Nation's energy needs; (2) the advisability of modifying the Department's patent policy to enable small businesses to commercialize emerging technologies; and (3) the activities of the Office. Establishes an Interagency Council on Small Scale Technology as an independent instrumentality of the U.S. in the executive branch. Directs the Council to review, coordinate, and report to Congress on the current and potential small-scale technology programs of the Government."
