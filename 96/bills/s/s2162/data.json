    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income tax credit in an amount equal to 30 percent of the total cost of wood fuel purchased by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Limits such credit to a maximum $250 ($125 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return), reduced by one percent of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of such taxpayer exceeds $15,000 ($7,500 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return). Provides for apportionment of such credit according to the individual's share of expenditures for the wood fuel purchased by a condominium management association, tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations, or by landlords and tenants."
