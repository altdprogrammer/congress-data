    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-04-10", 
    "text": "Omnibus Solar Energy Commercialization Act of 1979 - Establishes a national goal for the increased use of renewable energy resources as a part of the Nation's total energy supply in the year 2000. Defines the term \"passive solar energy system\" to mean space heating and cooling systems making the most efficient use of, or enhancing the use of, natural forces including solar insulation, winds, nighttime coolness, and cooling by radiation to the night sky, to heat or cool living space by the use of conductive, convective or radiant energy transfer. Describes several types of passive solar energy systems. States that it shall be the policy of the Secretary of Energy to utilize State and local government organizations, Energy Extension Services, regional Solar Energy Research Centers, and other such entities in providing information services, training, education and other services to the public and to persons involved in the development and commercialization of solar energy systems. Directs the Secretary to establish the Solar Heating and Cooling Information Center to provide information services to the public and to the entities listed above, including: (1) retrieval and dissemination of solar energy development and commercialization materials; (2) development of materials specifically designed to assist architects, builders, installers, manufacturers and others involved in solar energy development and commercialization; and (3) development of training and education programs specifically designed for such purposes. Directs Federal agency heads responsible for construction of new civilian Federal buildings to require the utilization of active and passive solar energy systems unless it is determined that such systems are not cost effective, according to a specified formula. Directs the head of each Federal agency operating a fueling station for civilian gasoline motor vehicles to require that such stations only dispense a ten percent alcohol and gasoline mixture. Requires that the same alcohol-gasoline mixture be dispensed by retail gasoline supply outlets operated by Federal agencies. Authorizes the Administrators of the Alaska Power Administration, the Bonneville Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, and the Western Area Power Administration to purchase power from proposed non-federally constructed generating facilities utilizing renewable energy resources. Authorizes such Administrators to construct and operate non-hydroelectric generating facilities, provided that the Administrator has made a public offer to purchase or guarantee the purchase of power from a comparable non-federally constructed facility and has received no offer from a non-Federal entity to construct such a facility. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Energy a Solar Energy Development Corporation with the same corporate powers given the Government National Mortgage Association. Sets forth the purposes of the Solar Corporation to provide financial initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy resources, including subsidies of long-term, low-interest loans. Sets forth terms and conditions of and limits on the amount of such loans. Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to include within the definition of \"weatherization materials\" materials associated with passive and active solar energy systems."
