Directs the chief trial judge of the United States Court of Claims to report to the Congress findings of fact and a recommendation as to what constitutes a fair, just, and equitable division of the award between the Seminole Indians of Florida and the Seminole Indians of Oklahoma. Makes such recommendation binding on the Secretary of the Interior at the end of the 60-day period following its submission if neither House of Congress adopts a resolution to the contrary. Provides for the allocation of the total share of the award of the Seminole Indians of Florida among the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and those Indians in Florida possessing at least one-fourth degree of Florida Seminole blood who have not shared in the claims of any other tribe."
