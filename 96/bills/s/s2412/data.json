    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Used Oil Recycling Act of 1980 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to define the terms used oil, recycled oil, lubricating oil, and re-refined oil. Requires lubricating oil to be labeled with a statement concerning the recycling of used oil. Establishes a temporary rule (effective until labeling standards are promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act) prohibiting the Federal Trade Commission from requiring recycled oil products to bear a label indicating they are derived from recycled oil. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make a grant to a State with an approved or proposed solid waste plan which: (1) encourages the use of recycled oil; (2) discourages uses hazardous to the protection of the public health and environment; (3) calls for informing the public of the uses of recycled oil; and (4) establishes a program for the collection and disposal of oil in a safe manner. Authorizes the Administrator to provide technical assistance to States in removing impediments to the recycling of used oil. Directs the Administrator to: (1) promulgate regulations establishing performance standards and other requirements necessary to protect the public health and environment from hazards associated with recycled oil; (2) determine the applicability to used oil of the requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act concerning the listing and identification of hazardous waste and to report the determination to Congress; and (3) study disposal problems and the collection cycle of used oil, supply and demand in the used oil industry, and energy savings associated with re-refining used oil."
