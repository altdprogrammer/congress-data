Establishes such Board as an independent agency in the executive branch consisting of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and three members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Directs that the members serve four year terms, with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Board to require that it receive notification within 30 days of: (1) a proposed price increase by any person having gross sales or revenues over $250,000,000 in the most recent fiscal year; (2) a pending wage increase by an employer or employee's representative involving over 5,000 employees; or (3) a proposed wage or price increase by any person designated by regulation of the Board without regard to sales, revenues, or number of employees. Empowers the Board to delay such increases for 45 days By order or regulation. Authorizes judicial enforcement of any requirement imposed under this Act in actions brought by the Attorney General. Authorizes the Board to recommend counter-inflationary measures to the President, including voluntary wage and price guidelines. Requires the Board to make a semiannual report to the Congress. Terminates the authority granted by this Act on September 30, 1984."
