States that such prohibition shall not apply if the Secretaries determine that a food preservative is commercially available: (1) which has essentially the same effect on meat products as nitrites; (2) which is effective in the protection of public health from botulism and other forms of food poisoning; and (3) will not impose an unreasonable economic burden on consumers or meat processors. Requires the Secretaries to conduct or support (by grant or contract) research and development activities for a food preservative alternative to nitrites."
