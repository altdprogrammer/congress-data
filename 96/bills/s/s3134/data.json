    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit against the income tax equal to 15 percent of the cost (not to exceed $1,500) of acquiring a qualified electric motor vehicle or the cost of converting a vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine to the use of electrical power. Limits such credit to acquisition, for original use, after December 31, 1980, and before January 1, 1991. Reduces such credit to ten percent of the cost (not to exceed $1,000) of acquiring or converting an electric vehicle designed to carry less than four passengers."
