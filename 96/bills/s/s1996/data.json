Rept. 96-1526) Wood Residue Utilization Act of 1980 - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and/or operate pilot wood residue utilization projects and demonstrations, including utilization demonstration areas, fuel wood concentration and distribution centers, and the construction of access roads. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out pilot wood residue utilization projects using residue removal incentives to compensate specified purchasers of National Forest System timber for costs incurred in the removal of residues from timber sale areas to points of prospective use. Sets forth guidelines for such pilot projects, including the requirement of cost-effectiveness for any nonsafety-related removal of wood residues, limiting the amount of residue removal credits to the difference between the value of the timber and other designated charges, and authorizing the Secretary to sell such residues for at least the appraised value. Requires the Secretary to make annual reports to Congress. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1986 to carry out pilot wood residue utilization projects and demonstrations."
