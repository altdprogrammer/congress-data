Authorizes the Secretary, upon receipt of a request for such a suspension, to discontinue the reduction being made in such person's retired or retainer pay on account of participation in the Plan. Requires the individual electing to suspend participation in the Plan to obtain the written consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries involved. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish to each person who requests suspension of participation in the Plan a written statement of the advantages of participating in the Plan and the disadvantages of suspending participation. Allows a specified time for withdrawal of the suspension request. Permits reenrollment in the Plan if at any time subsequent to such suspension the VA reduces such person's service-connected disability rating to less than total and the individual makes application to the Secretary within the prescribed period. Authorizes the Secretary to resume reductions in such person's retired or retainer pay upon receipt of such application."
