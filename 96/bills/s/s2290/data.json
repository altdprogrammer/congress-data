    "text": "Home Mortgage Disclosure Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to require certain depository institutions to disclose, each calendar year (previously each fiscal year), by neighborhood, the number and dollar amount of mortgage and home improvement loans made and purchased. Specifies that any such disclosure, with respect to calendar year 1980 and thereafter, shall be compiled on a standardized form prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in consultation with specified Federal financial regulatory agencies. Requires such agencies, in consultation with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and such other public and private entities as such agencies deem appropriate, to jointly develop and implement means for increasing accessibility by the public to the information required to be disclosed under such Act. Requires such means to include the centralized collection and maintenance of such information by the financial regulatory agencies, other Federal agencies, local governments or government depository libraries. Requires proposed regulations with respect to the centralized collection and maintenance of information to be published with 180 days of the enactment of this Act. Extends the authority granted by such Act until September 30, 1985. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to disclose information which the Secretary may possess with respect to mortgages under titles I and II of the National Housing Act which are not otherwise subject to the requirements of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975."
