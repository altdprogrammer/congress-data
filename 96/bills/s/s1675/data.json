States that the objectives of such system shall be to: (1) control, account for, and monitor all factors in the child support enforcement collection and paternity determination process; (2) determine if a collection of a support payment causes a change affecting eligibility for or the amount of aid under the aid to families with dependent children program (part A, title IV); and (3) provide information on all cases from initial referral through collection and enforcement."
