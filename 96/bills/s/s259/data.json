Requires each agency to report to Congress on the agency actions to meet this goal or to justify any failure to do so. Stipulates that any agency which certifies that it will be unable to accomplish such reduction within two years must do so within five years. Defines paperwork costs as the costs to the public of complying with agency paperwork requirements and the costs to the agency of administering those requirements. Directs the President and the Comptroller General to develop strategies to reduce paperwork costs for the executive and independent agencies, respectively. Requires the President to formulate the methodology for determining paperwork costs."
