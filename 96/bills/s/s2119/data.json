    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 96-934) Georges Bank Protection Act - Establishes requirements applicable to any oil and gas activity on the Georges Bank. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, beginning three and one-half years after the date of enactment of this Act, to issue permits in accordance with the Clean Water Act for discharges of drilling effluents into the marine environment only upon a determination, based on specified studies, that the discharges will not adversely affect the fisheries resources. Authorizes the Administrator to issue such permits without such a determination under emergency meteorological conditions. Directs the heads of specified Federal agencies to conduct a monitoring and research program to ascertain the effects of oil and gas activity on the biological populations of Georges Bank and the consequent economics of those marine resources. Lists seven specific studies to be carried out under the program. Requires the program to be carried out with appropriations under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and, generally, to be completed three years from the date of enactment of this Act. Requires a report evaluating and assessing such environmental monitoring and research to be submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Establishes a biological task force composed of specified Federal agency appointees to: (1) monitor the effects of oil and gas activity on biological populations in the area; (2) coordinate and evaluate the studies on the extent and composition of biological populations in Georges Bank; and (3) make recommendations with respect to the need for additional environmentally protective measures. Requires that the recommendations be implemented by the appropriate agency unless the head of the agency makes specific written determinations. Maintains the authority of any agency to require additional protective measures under other applicable laws in connection with oil and gas operations on the Georges Bank. Requires the President to direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard: (1) to prepare a study ascertaining the status and availability of equipment necessary to respond to a major oilspill on the Georges Bank; and (2) in consultation with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to recommend actions to minimize the effects of an oilspill on the fishery resources. Directs Federal agencies and industry engaged in oil and gas operations in the Georges Bank to prepare oilspill contingency plans based on the recommendations of such study, within one year of submittal of the report. Requires that such plans be updated every two years to reflect technological advances, experience, and knowledge gained in oil and gas activity in the Georges Bank area, and projections of future oil and gas activity in such area."
