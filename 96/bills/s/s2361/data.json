    "text": "Vietnam Veterans Career Development, Advancement, and Training Assistance Act of 1980 - Establishes a program of career development, advancement, training, and related services for Vietnam-era veterans. Defines, for purposes of this Act: (1) eligible veteran; (2) active duty; (3) eligible employer; (4) dependent; (5) career development and advancement program; and (6) career development and training program. Sets forth provisions regarding entitlement to and eligibility of a veteran for a career development and advancement or training allowance. Sets the duration of such eligibility for an eligible veteran. Requires the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to provide occupational and vocational counseling. Permits an eligible veteran to select a program of career development and advancement or a program of career development and training with an eligible employer in a chosen career field if the employer hires such veteran into its regular workforce with the expectation of permanent employment of the veteran after the training and career development assistance ends. Disallows approval of enrollment of a veteran for: (1) seasonal, intermittent or temporary jobs; (2) jobs paying less than $4.00 an hour, unless the Administrator determines in a particular case that the clause does not apply; (3) jobs outside the United States or its territories or possessions; (4) jobs under which commissions are the primary source of income; (5) employment which involves political or religious activities; (6) employment in an industry which a substantial number of experienced and able workers are unemployed; (7) jobs that are above entry level, except when applicable personnel procedures and collective bargaining procedures regarding the advancement of currently employed workers are complied with; (8) employment which would result in the displacement of any currently employed worker; and (9) jobs which if filled would replace any worker who is on lay off, or on strike. Requires the Administrator to discontinue the career development and advancement allowance of an eligible veteran whose conduct or progress is unsatisfactory. Allows the Administrator to renew the veterans' allowance under certain conditions. Directs the Administrator to pay to each eligible veteran employer, on behalf of each eligible veteran, an allowance to meet in part the expenses of such veterans' wages, benefits, training, and any other necessary or appropriate costs. Sets forth provisions for computation of career development, advancement, and training allowances, and payment to eligible employers. Outlines the specifications for approval of career development and advancement programs. Provides for the issuance of certificates of approval to the eligible employers. Requires an employer who receives an overpayment as a result of: (1) willful or negligent failure to report a veteran's excessive absences from work or interruptions in a planned program; or (2) false certification, to repay the amount of such overpayment to the United States. Allows the Administrator to make a complete report of the facts to the appropriate approving agency and, if considered advisable, to the Attorney General of the United States for appropriate action. Allows an eligible veteran to make one change of program, unless the Administrator finds sufficient reason to support further changes. Authorizes the Administrator to periodically conduct compliance surveys. Outlines the duties of the Secretary of Labor under this Act. Directs the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor, and of Health, Education, and Welfare, to provide for an outreach and public information program to inform eligible veterans of the program established by this Act."
