Defines \"small business stock\" as common or preferred stock of a domestic corporation which does not have passive income (e.g., rents, royalties, interest, etc.) for a taxable year in excess of 20 percent of its gross receipts, and which has equity capital not in excess of $25,000,000. Limits nonrecognition treatment to stock held by the taxpayer for more than 12 months. Provides for the reduction of the basis of the small business stock purchased by the taxpayer by the amount of gain which is not recognized due to the application of this Act. Provides for a three year statute of limitations for the assessment of tax deficiencies with respect to the gain from the sale of small business stock."
