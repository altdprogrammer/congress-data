    "text": "Congressional Regulatory Review Act of 1979 - Requires each Federal agency to prepare for each rule it issues a statement of evaluation which: (1) describes the need and statutory authority for the rule; (2) provides an estimate of the number of individuals and businesses the rule will affect; and (3) describes the economic impact and paperwork impact of the rule. Directs the agency to publish a summary of such statement with the general notice of a proposed rule or within 90 days of the general notice of a proposed rule which the agency certifies to be an emergency rule or a rule with short-term judicial or statutory guidelines. Directs each agency to prepare and make available to the public a revised statement of evaluation which: (1) reflects any modifications of the proposed rule that are incorporated in the final rule; and (2) describes significant public comments on the proposed rule and the reasons the agency did not incorporate certain comments in the final rule. Requires each agency to submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives the text and statement of evaluation of each final rule. States that a rule shall not become effective if: (1) a committee of either House reports a resolution disapproving the rule within 60 days after receiving it; and (2) either House adopts the resolution within 60 days after it is reported. Declares that an emergency rule may take effect immediately but shall lapse if a resolution disapproving it is adopted. Prohibits an agency from promulgating a rule which is substantially identical to a disapproved rule. Requires an agency to reconsider an existing rule if either House of Congress adopts a resolution for reconsideration of such rule. Declares that such rule shall lapse unless the agency repromulgates a substantially identical rule within 60 days. Requires any repromulgated rule which is not substantially identical to the reconsidered rule to be treated as a proposed rule under this Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. Sets forth the House and Senate procedure for the consideration of resolutions of disapproval and resolutions for reconsideration."
