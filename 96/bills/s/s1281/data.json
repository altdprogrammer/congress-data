Limits the trade for such vessels to the carrying of passengers, their accompanying baggage, and 1,000 measurement tons of cargo per annum. Authorizes the vessel United States to engage in the domestic and foreign commerce of the United States and/or between foreign ports so long as the vessel's domestic trade is limited to the carriage of passengers, their baggage and 1,000 measurement tons of cargo per annum. Stipulates that the steamships Mariposa and Monterey may, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, be allowed to remain under the American flag and operate totally in both the domestic and foreign commerce of the United States and/or between foreign ports."
