    "text": "Indian Reservation Special Magistrate and Law Enforcement Act of 1980 - Directs the President to appoint special magistrates as necessary to serve each Indian reservation over which the United States exercises criminal jurisdiction under existing law. Provides that preferential consideration be given U.S. magistrates who are already available. Applies generally to such special magistrates the jurisdiction and powers provided magistrates under existing law. Permits any defendant appearing before a special magistrate to be assisted by a lay spokesman of his or her choice. Requires that the special magistrate, in consultation with tribal authorities and county and municipal officials, develop a list of persons residing within the reservation for purposes of jury selection. Authorizes tribal police officers, Bureau of Indian Affairs police officers, and Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers to execute any arrest or search warrants or other orders which the special magistrate is authorized to issue in criminal cases. Authorizes necessary appropriations beginning in fiscal year 1982 to carry out this Act."
