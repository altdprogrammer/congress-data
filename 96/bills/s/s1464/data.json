Requires the cost of acquisition of such land to be the sum of: (1) the value of such land as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on January 9, 1980; and (2) the amount of outstanding debts and obligations of a specified corporation attributable to the development of such land (not to exceed $240,000). Requires all development plans and other work products relating to such development of the land to be transferred to the Indian tribe. Directs that the cost of acquisition agreed to in such agreement shall be treated as if it were final judgment of the Court of Claims. Prohibits offsetting any judgment against the United States in favor of such tribe based on such acquisition cost."
