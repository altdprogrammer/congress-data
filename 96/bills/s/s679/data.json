Authorizes a district court, in suits for damages brought under the Consumer Product Safety Act in which the plaintiff is adjudged to recover less than $10,000, to deny or to impose costs on such plaintiff. Abolishes diversity of citizenship as a basis of jurisdiction of Federal district courts, but retains as a basis of jurisdiction \"alienage,\" involving foreign states or citizens of foreign states. Increases the amount in controversy requirement in such cases from $10,000 to $25,000. Retains as a basis for Federal jurisdiction statutory interpleader, which includes actions between citizens of different States. Permits venue for a Federal civil action in any judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or in which a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated. Provides that a civil action brought in a State court of which the Federal district courts have original jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship may be removed to the Federal court only by a party in interest joined and served as a defendent who is a citizen or subject of a foreign state."
