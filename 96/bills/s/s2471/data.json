Prohibits the Senate from considering any legislation affecting the Federal budget before the adoption of the first concurrent resolution on the budget unless the Senate Budget Committee reports a resolution permitting the consideration of such legislation. Requires a three-fifths vote in the Senate and a majority vote in the House to adopt any second concurrent resolution on the budget. Requires any further revisions in the congressional budget to be adopted by a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate. Makes the figures set forth in the first concurrent resolution on the budget binding upon all legislation relating to the budget. Permits points of order to be raised against measures which would affect the figures applicable to any functional category as set forth in a budget resolution."
