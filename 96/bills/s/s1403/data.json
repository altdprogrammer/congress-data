Deletes the requirement that State reclamation programs must be consistent with regulations issued by the Secretary. Deletes the requirement that the Secretary shall implement a Federal lands program within one year of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to implement such a program to coincide with the implementation of a State program. Requires States to be responsible for mine inspection during the period of time prior to the submittal of State plans for approval."
