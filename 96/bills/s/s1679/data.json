    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, S. Rept. 96-617) Patent Law Amendments of 1979 - Directs the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to establish regulations governing: (1) the citation to the Patent and Trademark Office of prior art patents or publications which are pertinent to a later patent; and (2) the reexamination of a patent to determine whether such a prior patent or publication has any bearing on the patentability of any claim of such patent. Authorizes any individual to: (1) cite to the Office any such prior patent; and (2) request such a reexamination. Requires the Commissioner within 90 days of such a request to make a determination as to whether the cited prior patent raises a new question of the patentability of any claim of the later patent. Authorizes the Commissioner on his or her own initiative to make such a determination at any time. States that a determination that no new question is raised shall be final. Directs the Commissioner, upon determining that there is a new question of patentability, to order and conduct a reexamination. Requires that the patent owner be provided a reasonable period to file a statement on such question and that the person making the reexamination request be provided two months to respond to such statement. Declares that the patent owner shall be provided an opportunity in any reexamination to amend any claim of the patent in order to distinguish the claim from the prior patent cited, or in response to a decision adverse to the patentability of the claim. Authorizes the owner to appeal any adverse decision. Directs the Commissioner, upon the conclusion of any reexamination or appeal proceeding, to issue and publish a certificate cancelling any unpatentable claim, confirming any valid claim, and incorporating any amended claim in the patent. Declares that no prior patent or publication may be relied upon as evidence of nonpatentability in a civil action involving the validity or infringement of a patent unless: (1) the prior patent or publication was cited by or to the Office regarding application or reexamination proceedings for the patent; or (2) the court concludes that the interests of justice would be furthered by adjudication of the action without such prior administrative consideration. Sets forth circumstances under which a court may stay the proceedings of a civil action involving the infringement or validity of a patent to enable either party to such action to secure a determination on a request for reexamination of the patent by the Patent and Trademark Office."
