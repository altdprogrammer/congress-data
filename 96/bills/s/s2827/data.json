    "text": "Communications Act Amendments of 1980 - Title I: General - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to declare that such Act applies to, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has jurisdiction over: (1) all interexchange and international telecommunications and all transmission of electromagnetic energy by radio, which originates or is received within the United States; (2) the licensing and regulating of all radio stations; and (3) all persons engaged within the United States in such telecommunications or such radio transmissions. Directs the FCC to develop and report to Congress on methods for determining the value of and collecting fees for the commercial benefit received by various classes of licenses. Title II: Domestic and International Telecommunications; Rural Telecommunications Development - Directs the FCC to establish a transition plan to foster marketplace competition and to implement deregulation for interexchange and international telecommunications services, equipment, and carriers. Requires such plan to: (1) classify common carriers; (2) establish and implement an accounting system; (3) provide a procedure for the formation of fully separated affiliates and to monitor compliance; and (4) provide for practices and procedures for exchange access charges and a Universal Service Pool in substitution for existing arrangements. Declares the policy of the United States to be reliance when possible upon full and fair marketplace competition to provide all telecommunications services. Directs the FCC to revise, reduce, or eliminate rules with respect to telecommunication services or carriers operating in a market as competition develops. Grants the FCC continuing authority over the provision of regulated telecommunications services and carriers. Directs the FCC to ensure that all allocation, assignment, and authorization policies, standards, and rules with respect to the licenses issued to telecommunication carriers are not inconsistent with such policy. Permits the FCC to establish nonadjudicatory (excluding economic) methods for choosing among competing applicants for radio frequencies to be used by telecommunications carriers. Requires the FCC to identify those carriers deriving revenue from the procedures established by the telephone industry to allocate the costs and divide the revenues associated with the provision of basic telephone service. Classifies such carriers as regulated carriers. Requires the FCC to identify those regulated carriers which, together with affiliates, each serve 750,000 or more telephones to be classified as dominant-regulated carriers. Requires the FCC to identify any telecommunications carrier which owns, controls, or leases any international telecommunications facility. Classifies such carrier as a regulated international telecommunications carrier. Classifies further as dominant-regulated carriers any carrier providing basic telephone service internationally and the Communications Satellite Corporation. Directs the FCC to classify or reclassify as a regulated carrier any carrier which owns or controls telecommunications facilities for which there is no reasonably available alternative or which provides any other regulated service. Directs the FCC to classify or reclassify as a dominant-regulated carrier any regulated carrier which is dominant in such ownership, control, or provision. Permits the FCC to reclassify any dominant-regulated carrier as a regulated carrier and any regulated carrier as an unregulated carrier. Prohibits the FCC from regulating the resale of any telecommunications service except those offered by a quasi-governmental entity which has a statutory monopoly for the delivery of letters. Prohibits any regulated carrier from establishing or enforcing any restrictions on the resale, sharing, or other use of any service provided by such carrier. Prohibits any dominant-regulated carrier from engaging in any resale activity other than through a fully separated affiliate. Authorizes the FCC to prescribe different requirements for different regulated carriers, considering the extent of telecommunications facility ownership or control and the nature of services offered. Makes a regulated carrier liable for damages to any persons injured for violations of such Act.

Authorizes the FCC to impose different filing, notification, and information requirements on different carriers. Requires regulated carriers to make public tariffs showing charges, practices, and regulations for regulated telecommunications services and through routes. Prohibits any regulated carrier from providing regulated telecommunications services unless such tariffs are filed. Prohibits deviation from such tariffs. Requires that new or revised tariffs proposed by regulated carriers for regulated telecommunications services be conditionally accepted or finally approved by the FCC before taking effect. Authorizes the FCC to facilitate public negotiation between such carriers and interested parties opposing such tariffs. Directs the FCC to hold hearings for good cause shown, upon request, with the burden of proof on the carrier to show that such tariff is just and reasonable. Authorizes the FCC to accept, condition, or reject such tariff or prescribe a different tariff. Requires any non-dominant-regulated international carrier with respect to interconnection arrangements, and permits any regulated carrier, to file any new or revised tariff. Permits any party in interest to request a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such tariff. Authorizes the FCC to accept, condition, or reject such tariff. Requires every regulated carrier subject to this Act to file with the FCC copies of all contracts or agreements with other carriers in relation to any regulated telecommunications service. Authorizes the FCC to appraise any or all of the property owned or used by any regulated carrier, and by any regulated exchange carrier which originates, terminates, or transfers interexchange or international telecommunications. Repeals the provision relating to the Interstate Commerce Commission valuation of such property. Permits any non-dominant-regulated carrier, upon notifying the FCC, to construct, acquire, or utilize new or extended exchange telecommunications facilities. Authorizes the FCC to require such carrier to obtain a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require such construction, acquisition, or operation. Requires dominant-regulated carriers to obtain such a certificate. Permits the FCC to authorize a long-term facilities construction plan for a regulated carrier, rather than requiring such carrier to obtain a separate certification for each element of such plan. Authorizes the FCC to condition or refuse such authorization or certification as the public convenience and necessity may require. Authorizes the FCC to require, after opportunity for a hearing, a regulated carrier to extend its facilities for the expeditious and efficient performance of its services.

Authorizes the FCC to authorize temporary or emergency augmentation of facilities or services or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of services or facilities. Requires any dominant-regulated carrier and its affiliates to: (1) file with the FCC a description of the operational protocols and technical interface requirements for connection with or use of any regulated telecommunications services; and (2) report regularly to the FCC any material change in such protocols or requirements and summaries of construction programs or activities which would affect the service offerings of competing carriers or persons seeking interconnection. Requires such information to be withheld from a fully separated affiliate or an internal competitive support division until filed. Directs the FCC to prescribe guidelines of general applicability relating to recordkeeping requirements for regulated carriers. Authorizes (presently directs) the FCC to prescribe for such carriers the classes of property for which depreciation charges may be included in operating expenses. Repeals the forfeiture provision for failure to keep required records. Requires any carrier which provides basic telephone or telecommunications service to allocate to each route all of the costs which vary directly with traffic on that route and a proportionate share of interexchange joint and common costs.

Directs the FCC to establish a Joint Board to assist in: (1) establishing uniform practices to ascertain and apportion the costs of exchange operations between exchange and interexchange services and among interexchange services; and (2) managing the Universal Service Pool. Requires the FCC to establish the forms for records to be kept by carriers providing such exchange access. Requires each such carrier to file with the FCC a tariff governing the charges, practices, and conditions for the use of its exchange telecommunications services. Sets forth the requirements for access charges, including nondiscrimination and directly related cost-basing. Directs the FCC to establish a schedule of surcharges to ensure the continued universal availability of basic telephone service at reasonable rates. Limits the annual amount to be collected through surcharges and places such surcharges in a Universal Service Pool.

Permits a refusal to deal with any nonaffiliate if such refusal is based upon prudent business judgment. Requires each division of AT&T to bear its properly allocable share of costs for management and research. Requires AT&T to receive FCC approval before offering any telecommunications service or equipment on an unregulated basis. Prohibits the exchange of information from a dominant-regulated carrier to a competitive support-division which would give an unfair, competitive advantage. Requires all functions related to final assembly of any unregulated telecommunications equipment or equipment to be used in support of any unregulated service to be performed by a fully separated affiliate by a specified time. Sets forth a schedule for the transfer of specified functions and information to such affiliate. Requires the establishment of an assets evaluation board to determine the value of assets transferred from AT&T to any fully separated affiliate. Permits the FCC to waive such transition schedule if intervening events beyond the control of AT&T render it incapable of compliance. Prohibits AT&T from transferring in support of any unregulated services or equipment, any goods or services for which it is the only source of supply to a fully separated affiliate after the transition period. Exempts access to any telecommunications facility from such prohibition. States that the 1956 consent degree involving AT&T shall not bar AT&T and any affiliate from providing telecommunications service or equipment or information services so long as unregulated telecommunications service is conducted by fully separated affiliates. States that the provision of radioexchange telecommunications under any franchise awarded by a State and within a radio exchange area configured by a State commission shall be deemed an exchange service for the purposes of this Act.
