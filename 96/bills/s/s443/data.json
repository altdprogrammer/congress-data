Stipulates that such assignments shall not affect the tenures of office of the United States attorneys and marshals for the Eastern District and the Southern District (as it existed prior to this Act), who shall on the date of enactment assume such positions for the Southern District and the Central District, respectively. Stipulates that the grand juries impaneled by the district courts for the Central and Southern Districts after the date of enactment may exercise their powers with respect to crimes committed within their respective districts before or after the date of enactment. Makes the effective date of the transfer of Kankakee County from the Northern District to the Central District of Illinois March 31, 1979, instead of May 1, 1979."
