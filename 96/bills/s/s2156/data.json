    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1980-05-08", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Northeast Corridor Completion Act - Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to extend the time period within which regularly scheduled and dependable intercity rail passenger service is to be established between Boston and New York and New York and Washington, D.C. to September 30, 1985. Extends the deadline for submission by the Secretary of Transportation of a comprehensive report on the financial and operating results of such intercity rail passenger service by four years. Directs the Comptroller General, after consultation with the Department of Transportation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, the United States Railway Association, affected railroads, and other interested parties, to report to Congress on rail passenger corridor service within 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Requires that such report include: (1) an evaluation of the potential costs and benefits of developing rail passenger service in other corridors; and (2) proposals on the manner in which costs should be shared or trackage rights fees established between rail freight and passenger service. Authorizes the use of up to $5,000,000 in unobligated funds, previously appropriated for fiscal year 1980 or such sums as may be appropriated for fiscal year 1981, to the General Accounting Office to carry out such studies. Directs the Department, within six months after the date of enactment of this Act, to develop plans for alternate off-corridor routings of freight traffic over Northeast Corridor lines between Washington, D.C. and the New York Metropolitan area. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with rail freight carriers and regional transportation agencies to provide for the implementation by such rail carriers of the off-corridor routings on such terms and conditions as the parties may agree. Sets forth: (1) procedures by which the Secretary shall apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of such agreements; and (2) the circumstances under which the Commission shall approve such agreements, or, if the Secretary and the involved parties are unable to reach agreement, find the terms and conditions necessary and binding upon all involved rail freight carriers. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress, within 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, on factors concerning the mixing of freight and passenger service on the same rail lines. Requires the Secretary to: (1) consult with the Comptroller General, the Corporation, the Association, affected railroads, and other interested parties in preparing such report; and (2) consider such factors as congestion, delays, fuel efficiency, and safety. Adds as a goal of the Northeast Corridor improvement project the elimination of congestion in rail freight and rail passenger traffic at the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the Northeast Corridor improvement project. Authorizes appropriations to remain available until expended for freight diversion and for repairs to the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire any real property which the Secretary deems necessary to effectuate such rail passenger service. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with cost-sharing parties which permit the Secretary to incur obligations to carry out improvements in anticipation of reimbursement from such parties. Permits the Secretary to transfer to the Corporation excess real or personal property from the Northeast Corridor improvement project. Establishes goals leading to self- sufficiency for such intercity rail passenger service beginning in fiscal year 1986. Directs the Corporation to submit annual reports on the progress toward such final goal to the President for transmission to Congress. Directs the Secretary, effective October 1, 1985, to transfer to the Corporation all authority and responsibility for carrying out the Northeast Corridor improvement project. Amends the Department of Transportation Act to authorize the Secretary to establish a working capital fund for financing the activities of the Transportation Systems Center. Sets forth the activities of such Center, including research, testing and analysis for the Department and other Government agencies and when approved by the Secretary, for State and local governments, other public authorities, private sources, and foreign countries. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 to repeal a provision directing the payment to the Corporation of funds appropriated for capital grants and the use of such grants for temporary reduction of outstanding loan balances. Lists priorities to be considered in the selection and scheduling of specified projects on the Northeast Corridor improvement project."
