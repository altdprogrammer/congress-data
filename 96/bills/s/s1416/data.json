    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act, with regard to State implementation plans for a national primary ambient air quality standard, to authorize the President, as well as the Governor of a State, to issue a temporary emergency suspension of any part of such plan applicable to a fuel burning stationary source. Requires either the President or the Governor to issue such an emergency suspension if either finds that foreign imports of fuels used by such source have reached an excessive level and that such imports can be reduced by the emergency suspension. Requires such suspension to remain in effect for a maximum of five years, or longer as the owner or operator of such source may persuade the suspension issuer as reasonable. Allows the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in a disapproval order to require a lesser period if the suspension is issued by a Governor. Limits any suspension for violation of any national ambient air quality standard to not more than four months. Requires any person who issued a suspension for a period in excess of four months to revoke such suspension if he determines that the fuel burning stationary source in question did not change to an alternate fuel."
