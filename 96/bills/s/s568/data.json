Authorizes the Foundation to support activities designed to increase the participation of women in courses of study leading to degrees in scientific and technical fields and to provide career encouragement and traineeship and fellowships opportunities for women in such areas. Authorizes the Foundation to support, programs in science and mathematics in elementary and secondary schools which emphasize the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and information by female student awareness of career opportunities requiring scientific and technical skills. Authorizes the Foundation to support activiites in continuing education in science and engineering to provide opportunities for women in the work force or women whose careers have been interrupted to acquire new knowledge, techniques, and skills in such fields. Authorizes the Foundation to undertake a comprehensive research program designed to increase understanding of the potential contribution of women in science and technology and to facilitate the participation and advancement of women in such careers. Authorizes the establishment of a visiting women scientists program. Authorizes the Foundation to support activities to improve the availability and quality of public information concerning the importance of the participation of women in careers in science and technology. Authorizes the Foundation to support activities of museums and science centers which demonstrate the potential to interest and involve women in science and technology. Authorizes the making of grants to be known as the National Research Opportunity Grants to specified women scientists to conduct scientific research in a field chosen by the recipient. Sets forth the terms and conditions of such grants. Authorizes the Foundation to make grants to individuals or academic institutions for full-time or part-time visiting professorships for women in science. Authorizes the Foundation to support demonstration project activities of individuals, public agencies, and private entities designed to encourage the employment and advancement of women in science, engineering, and technology. Authorizes the Foundation to undertake or support a comprehensive science education program to increase the participation of minorities in science and technology and to initiate research at minority institutions. Requires the Director of the Foundation, with the assistance of the Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Technology, to prepare and submit to specified congressional Committees a report proposing a comprehensive program to promote minoirty participation in such fields. Directs the President, with the assistance of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Director of the Foundation, to prepare and transmit to Congress: (1) a report proposing a comprehensive national policy and program for the promotion of equal opportunity for women and minorities in science and technology; and (2) a report proposing a comprehensive policy concerning the impacts of science and technology on women and miniorities. Establishes within the Foundation a Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Technology to advise the Foundation concerning the implementation of this Act. Establishes two subcommittees of such Committee; the Subcommittee on Women in Science and Technology and the Subcommittee on Minorities in Science and Technology and the Subcommittee on Minorities in Science and Technology. Sets forth membership requirements for such Committee. Requires the Committee to report annually on its activities to the Director and requires the Director to submit such report to Congress with comments. Requires the Director biennially to prepare and transmit to Congress and specified Federal official a report concerning the participation and status of women in science and technology, including an accounting and comparison by sex, race, and ethnic group, and by discipline, of the participation of women and men in scientific and technical positions.
