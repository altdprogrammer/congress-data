States that such acreage shall be reduced by any set-aside or diverted acreage. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the established price for any such commodity for which he requires producers not to exceed normally planted acreage. Sets the established prices for the 1980 and 1981 crops of such commodities at not less than the established prices for the previous year's crop of the respective commodities adjusted to reflect any change in the inflation rate for such previous crop year."
