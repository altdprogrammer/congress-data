Sets forth sanctions to be taken against State or local governments for failure to comply with such energy actions, consisting of the withholding of Federal-aid highway funds. Provides for a limited and expeditious procedure for judicial review of energy actions adversely affecting any person. Sets forth administrative provisions for carrying out the provisions of this Act."
