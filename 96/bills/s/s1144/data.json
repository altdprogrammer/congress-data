    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Quiet Communities Act - Amends the Noise Control Act of 1972 to cite such Act as the Quiet Communities Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $15,000,000 for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 to carry out the purposes of such Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and submit to the Congress a five-year plan for carrying out the Administrator's authority under such Act. Specifies that the plan shall include: (1) the objectives of each program; (2) the relative priorities among the programs; (3) proposed annual levels of funding; and (4) a timetable of specific actions proposed. States that the plan shall be developed in consultation with State and local governments. Specifies that separate portions of the plan be devoted to noise control research and aircraft and airport noise. Allows State or local governments to petition the Administrator to revise railroad noise emission standards on the grounds that a more stringent standard is necessary to protect the public health and welfare. Specifies procedures for agency response to such petitions. Extends the authorization of the National Commission on Air Quality through fiscal year 1981. Authorizes the reappropriation for fiscal year 1981 of funds appropriated for, but never expended by, the Commission in fiscal year 1978."
