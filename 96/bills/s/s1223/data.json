Directs each agency head to determine whether to grant such an award and to notify the eligible employee of such determination. Entitles an employee who qualifies for an award of between $10,000 and $25,000 to an amount equal to ten percent of the Government savings resulting from such employee's action during its first year of implementation. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to issue classification series for such offices."
