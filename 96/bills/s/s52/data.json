Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit to the President, Congress and the head of each independent agency an annual report which: (1) identifies duplicative or conflicting rules and regulations promulgated by executive departments or independent agencies; (2) determines the costs of compliance with such rules; and (3) makes recommendations for modifying, eliminating, or consolidating such rules. Requires each head of an independent agency and the President to transmit to Congress and the Comptroller General recommendations for changing the conflicting or duplicative rules promulgated by the agency or executive department, and to implement such recommendations 60 days after the transmittal unless Congress passes a concurrent resolution disapproving those recommendations. Directs the Comptroller General, within 30 days after the receipt of such reports, to submit a review of such reports to Congress."
