    "text": "Disability Insurance Amendments of 1979 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require the Commissioner of Social Security to develop and carry out experiments and demonstration projects designed to compare various methods of treating the work activity of disabled beneficiaries under title II, including reductions in benefits based on earnings, designed to encourage disabled beneficiaries to work. Requires the Commissioner to report to Congress on such projects. Excludes from an individual's earnings, in determining whether an individual can engage in substantial gainful activity, an amount equal to the cost of any attendant care services, medical devices, and similar items and services necessary to enable such individual to work, whether or not such assistance is needed to enable such individual to carry out such individual's normal daily functions. Provides \"trial work periods\" for disabled widows and widowers. Provides, in the case of children, widows, and widowers, that the period of time to which such individuals are entitled to disability insurance benefit payments may extend to the 15th month following the end of an individual's \"trial work period.\" Entitles individuals who have had \"trial work periods\" to hospital insurance benefits under title XVIII (Medicare) for a period of 24 months under title II terminated due to work. Eliminates the requirement that the 24 months which an individual must be disabled in order to qualify for hospital insurance benefits under the Medicare program be consecutive."
