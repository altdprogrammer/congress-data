Authorizes any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States to purchase electric power from any non-Federal person for consumption in Alaska by any facility of such department, agency, or instrumentality where the purchase will result in a savings to: (1) other consumers of electric energy without increasing the cost incurred by the Federal facility; or (2) to such department, agency, or instrumentality without increasing costs to other consumers. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) biennially report to Congress on actions taken pursuant to this Act by any department, agency, or instrumentality; and (2) conduct a study and issue a report to Congress concerning the sale of Federal power in States other than Alaska."
