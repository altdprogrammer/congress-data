    "text": "Export Trade Association Act of 1979 - Amends the Webb-Pomerene Act to exempt certified export trade associations from the antitrust laws. Authorizes Federal agencies to enforce only the provisions regarding such associations. Permits third parties to file petitions requesting enforcement action with the Secretary of Commerce. Limits the prohibition against unfair methods of competition to domestic competitors engaged in export trade. Sets forth the procedure for obtaining certification as an organization engaged solely in export trade. Provides for appeal of the Secretary's denial of certification. Requires the Secretary, the Attorney General, and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission to publish guidelines for determining whether an association will meet the certification requirements. Requires certified associations to submit annual reports to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Commerce an office to promote export trade associations. Provides for automatic certification of existing associations. Stipulates that all applications for certification be kept confidential with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Secretary to require an association to modify its operation to be consistent with international obligations of the United States. Directs the President to appoint, with the Senate's advice and consent, a task force seven years after enactment to examine the effect of this Act and to make recommendations."
