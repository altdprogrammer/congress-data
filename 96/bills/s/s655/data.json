Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $750 for a taxable year ($1,500 in the case of a joint return). Defines \"incentive stock\" as common or preferred stock which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which is part of an issue the sale price of which does not exceed $25,000,000. Requires the issuing corporation to be a domestic corporation and to have an equity capital not in excess of $25,000,000. Disqualifies, for purposes of the credit, incentive stock which: (1) is acquired more than 180 days after its issuance; (2) is acquired by a stock broker; (3) is redeemed by the issuing corporation; (4) is investment company stock; (5) is disposed of less than 12 months after its acquisition; and (6) is held by a trust or estate."
