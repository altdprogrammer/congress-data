States that the first 250,000 pieces of an issue of a publication which is eligible for second-class postage shall qualify for a reduced per piece rate currently in effect for presorted mail, regardless of whether such pieces meet weight or volume requirements for the presorted rate (thus extending such rate to small publications). Stipulates that both amendments shall apply with respect to matter mailed after September 30, 1980."
