    "text": "Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to revise the authority of the Secretary of Energy to lease lands containing oil shale deposits. Permits such leases to exceed 5120 acres of land if necessary to permit long-term commercial operations. Increases the number of such leases which may be held by a single individual from one to two in any one State and four nationwide. Permits the acquisition of one additional lease in a State where the holder has achieved commercial production and is within ten years of exhausting the reserves on one of the leases. Authorizes the unlimited issuance of leases to avoid bypass of otherwise uneconomical resources. Authorizes the Secretary to issue oil shale leases allowing the mining of other mineral deposits contained in the lands covered by such lease. Requires consultation with the Attorney General before issuing such leases which also allow coal mining. Authorizes the Secretary to issue additional leases to holders of oil shale leases if necessary for the development of an oil shale operation."
