Specifies that the technical assistance provided to water users on means and measures for limiting excess water applications to irrigated lands, as an element of the Grand Valley salinity control unit, shall be available, after December 31, 1989, only to those lands that participate in the Department of Agriculture programs to improve onfarm water management. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, from time to time, to review the plans for implementation of the units authorized by such Act, and, based upon his findings, make recommendations to the appropriate Congressional committees regarding the desirability of continuing to implement such units or portions thereof. Requires the Secretary to notify the Governors of the Colorado River Basin States of such recommendations. Authorizes appropriations for the construction of works necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Specifies the portion of such funds that are to be used for mitigation of fish and wildlife habitat losses."
