Allows such payments to be made for a period of up to seven years. States that the terms of such agreements shall require full repayment of the cumulative total of amounts disbursed by the Secretary, beginning in the eighth year and over the balance of the project amortization period. Makes such loan payments contingent upon the production and sale of an energy product to a buyer. Terminates the Secretary's authority to make such price support payments on December 31, 1994."
