    "text": "Sugar Act of 1979 - Subchapter I: Definitions - Defines terms used in this Act. Subchapter II: Quota Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to determine annually the amount of sugar needed to meet consumer requirements and to attain the price objective for sugar. Sets forth the formula for determining the price objective. Requires the Secretary to establish or revise sugar quotas based on such determinations. Apportions 6,820,000 short tons of raw value sugar according to specified percentages among domestic beet sugar, mainland cane sugar, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Permits 1,210,000 short tons of raw value sugar to be imported from the Philippines. Apportions the remaining amount of raw sugar determined necessary among specified countries according to specified percentages. Permits the President to suspend any sugar quota if such importation would be contrary to U.S. national interests. Prohibits any importation of sugar from Cuba until diplomatic relations are resumed by the United States. Stipulates that reductions or deficiencies in a sugar quota shall be prorated among the other foreign countries under enumerated circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary to limit the importation of sugar on only a quarterly basis through the first quarter of 1980; and thereafter only on a yearly basis. Stipulates procedures for making adjustments in determining consumer requirements in order to attain the price objective. Prohibits the Secretary from restricting the importation, shipment, or storage of sugar to one or more geographical areas. Requires sugar quotas for foreign countries to be filled only with sugar beets or sugarcane grown in that country. Directs the Secretary to establish quotas for sugar which may be marketed for local consumption in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Provides for domestic sugar producers to fill any deficits in such quotas. Authorizes the Secretary to make allotments of quotas to persons marketing sugar to assure an orderly and adequate flow of sugar or liquid sugar. Limits such allotments to 25,000 short tons of raw value sugar for sugar beet processors and to the effective inventory of sugar of a sugarcane processor as of January 1st of the year the allotment is made. Permits any person aggrieved by such decision to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Permits the Secretary to limit the importation of sugar- containing products or beet sugar molasses if it is determined such importation will substantially interfere with the objectives of this Act. Sets forth the amount of quota for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Ireland, and Panama which may be filled by direct-consumption sugar. Sets forth the amount of liquid sugar which may be imported from foreign countries. Prohibits the importation, transportation, or marketing of sugar in excess of the established quota or allotment. Exempts from the quota provisions the first ten short tons of raw value direct-consumption or liquid sugar imported for religious, sacramental, educational, or experimental purposes. Subchapter III: Conditional Payment Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary to make payments to producers who have not marketed sugar in excess of their proportionate share for the farm and to processors who have paid fair and reasonable prices for sugar beets or sugarcane. Directs the Secretary to establish proportionate shares for farms in those areas where the production of sugar is estimated to be greater than the quantity needed to enable the area to meet its quota and provide a normal carryover inventory. Requires the Secretary to protect the interests of new producers. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments for bona fide abandonment of planted acreage or for crop deficiencies due to natural disasters. Establishes the base rate of payment at 80 cents per hundred pounds of raw value sugar. Sets forth a graduated scale of reductions for sugar in excess of specified amounts. Stipulates that the Secretary's determinations are final and conclusive. Subchapter IV: Administrative Provisions - Authorizes appropriations necessary for the payments specified in Subchapter III. Authorizes the Secretary to make such orders or regulations as may be necessary to carry out this Act. Grants jurisdiction to the appropriate U.S. district courts to enforce this Act. Sets forth the fines or forfeitures imposed for violations of this Act. Authorizes the President to withhold or suspend any quota or to levy a duty on sugar imported from any foreign country which nationalizes or effectively expropriates, without compensation, any property at least 50 percent owned by U.S. citizens. Authorizes the Secretary, under specified circumstances, to study labor contracts and the methods of accomplishing most effectively the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue the necessary regulations to carry out the International Sugar Agreement. Provides for the termination of the provisions of this Act on December 31, 1984."
