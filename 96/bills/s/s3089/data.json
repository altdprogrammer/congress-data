Disapproves the proposed amendments relating to the admissibility of pleas (Rule 11), subpoenas (Rule 17), and production of statements of witnesses (Rule 26.2). Revises the proposed amendment relating to the procedures for revocation of probation (Rule 32.1) to authorize a probation officer to issue a summons for or arrest a probationer or the court to issue a warrant, if there is cause to believe that a probationer has violated a condition of probation. Eliminates from the proposed amendment relating to the assignment of counsel (Rule 44) the provision requiring, in cases involving joint representation, the court to protect each defendant's right to counsel \"unless it appears that there is good cause to believe that no conflict of interest is likely to arise.\""
