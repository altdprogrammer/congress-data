Requires reduction of such credit by five percent of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer exceeds $20,000. Sets a minimum credit amount of $1,000. Requires adjustment of such dollar amounts according to a defined inflation adjustment factor. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations allocating interest credited to joint accounts."
