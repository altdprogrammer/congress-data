Authorizes the Small Business Administration to make grants to States, State agencies, regional entities, State-chartered development credit corporations, and institutions of higher learning to assist in establishing Small Business Development Centers. Requires such grants to be matched in equal amounts by funds from non-Federal sources. Establishes additional restrictions on such grants for fiscal years 1979 through 1982. Requires that such center must have a full time staff director, business analysts, technology transfer agents, information specialists, and have access to part-time professional specialists and laboratory and adaptive engineering facilities. Directs the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to cooperate with small business development centers participating in the program and to report annually to the SBA and the Congress and to make recommendations to the SBA on continued funding.

Requires that studies of the credit needs of small business and to what extent such needs are being met be conducted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in consultation with the SBA and the Bureau of Census, who shall report the results to the Congress by January 1, 1981. =Title V: White House Conference on Small Business= - White House Conference on Small Business Act - Directs the President to call and conduct a White House Conference on Small Business to identify problems of small business and to develop recommendations for executive and legislative action as may be appropriate for maintaining and encouraging small business. Sets forth requirements and procedures for appointment of members to the Conference, submission of reports, and planning and administration. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this title, including reimbursement of certain expenses for conference delegates. =Title VI: Employee Ownership= - Small Business Employee Ownership Act - Amends the Small Business Act to make employee-owned firms eligible for financial assistance under the business loan program. States that in the case of small business concerns using an employee stock ownership plan, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, all financial assistance shall be made to the trust created for employee ownership of stock (ESOT). Predicates such assistance on: (1) a guarantee by the company seeking assistance that it will repay all obligations incurred by the ESOT; (2) the satisfaction of the SBA that all funds acquired by the plan with the assistance of the SBA will be used solely in connection with the purchase of qualified employer securities, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and that such funds will not be used to acquire the employer securities of another corporation or to finance any other enterprise; and (3) a distribution arrangement which assures all participants in the plan will have a non-forfeitable right to all employer securities acquired with the assistance of the SBA no later than the expiration date of such assistance. Authorizes the extension of loan guarantees to qualified trusts or to finance the acquisition of the employees workplace if it is a small business or a subsidiary which, if independently owned, would be a small business. States that such guarantees may be extended only if the small business or subsidiary would otherwise close, liquidate, relocate or sell out to a large business or if the owner agrees to the purchase by the employees. Requires an employee organization or the representative of a stock ownership plan to prepare a plan containing specified provisions for the acquisition of the concern or subsidiary in order to be eligible for such guarantees. Limits the principal amount of any loan guaranteed under this Act to $500,000. Directs the Administrator of the SBA to report periodically to the Congress on the programs established by this Act. Directs the SBA to conduct a study of the feasibility of extending the authority of the SBA to make guarantees directly to the seller in installment sales to small businesses."
