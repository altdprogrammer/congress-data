Prohibits either Secretary from prohibiting commerce on or after April 30, 1980, in any food to which nitrite has been added if the addition of such nitrite: (1) is shown to be safe; or (2) if not shown to be safe, is shown to be necessary to protect against botulism. Extends the period of such moratorium until such time as an alternative anti-toxin becomes available. Requires each Secretary to make an annual review of all regulations issued under this Act in order to determine progress toward making available effective and feasible alternative means for preventing botulism."
