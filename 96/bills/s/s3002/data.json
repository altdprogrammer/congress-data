Authorizes the Secretary to establish a Service Sector Consultative Committee to promote the development and competitiveness of U.S. service firms. Sets forth the purposes of the Committee which include: (1) advising the Department on measures the Government may take to enhance the competitiveness of the private sector; (2) acting as a liaison between the Government and the private sector; (3) maintaining communications between other Government advisory committees on service-related issues; and (4) discussing and studying domestic service-related matters relating to economic policy.
