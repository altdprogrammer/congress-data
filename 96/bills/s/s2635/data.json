    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Small Business Energy Conservation act of 1980 - Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to make \"energy facilities\" eligible for Small Business Administration (SBA) contract guarantees. Includes within such definition: (1) solar equipment; (2) photovoltaic cells and related equipment; (3) equipment designed to increase the energy efficiency of existing fossil fuel systems; (4) industrial cogeneration equipment; or (6) equipment for producing energy or fuel from wood, biological waste, grain, or other biomass sources. States that any SBA contract guarantee shall: (1) not be terminated or otherwise revoked; (2) be conclusive evidence of compliance with such Act; and (3) be valid and incontestable in the hands of the holder. Provides that the SBA fix a uniform fee for such guarantees (presently an annual fee). Eliminates existing \"rental guarantee\" and \"lessee-lessor\" language in escrow and default provisions. Authorizes the SBA to invest nonappropriated revolving fund moneys in federally-guaranteed bonds or obligations. Stipulates that moneys provided as capital for the fund may not be invested. Limits guarantee expenditures to $250,000,000 for fiscal year 1981, and $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1982."
