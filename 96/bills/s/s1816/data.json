Permits warrants to be issued to search for or seize such matter only if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that such matter would be destroyed or hidden; (2) there is probable cause to believe that such matter is contraband; or (3) the identity of the possessor of such matter cannot be determined within a reasonable time with reasonable effort. Makes evidence obtained in violation of this Act inadmissible in any court.
