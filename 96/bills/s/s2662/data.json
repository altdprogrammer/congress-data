    "text": "Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to permit any person having special scientific, technical, or professional qualifications, in the employ or service of the U.S. Government, to be assigned to a foreign government (presently restricted to U.S. citizens). Revises the authority of the Director of the International Communication Agency (ICA) to purchase vehicles for use abroad to: (1) no longer restrict such authority to passenger vehicles; and (2) permit security vehicles to be purchased without regard to maximum price limitations. Provides for the principal assistant of an ICA Associate Director to perform the duties of any Associate Director who dies, resigns, or is sick or absent. Authorizes the making of procurement contracts for periods which do not exceed five years if: (1) appropriations are adequate for the first fiscal year; (2) government need is reasonably firm and continuing; (3) such contract will encourage effective competition or promote economics in performance and operation; and (4) such method will not inhibit small business participation. Requires such contracts to be cancelled if funds are not available for continuation into subsequent fiscal years."
