    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) National Visitor Center Emergency Repair Act of 1980 - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 to the Secretary of the Interior for making emergency repairs to and protecting structures at the National Visitor Center in the District of Columbia. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of Transportation regarding such repairs or protection. Directs the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice to prepare an opinion on the question of whether the United States or the Terminal Realty Baltimore Co. and the Terminal Realty Penn Co. are legally liable for the repairs anticipated by the provisions of this Act. Directs the Attorney General, if the Office of Legal Counsel determines that there is a reasonable cause to believe a party other than the United States is legally obligated to bear all or a portion of the costs of that repair authorized by this Act, to institute an action to recover expenditures that were incurred by Secretary pursuant to this Act. Declares that none of the actions taken pursuant to this Act shall be deemed to limit or affect in any way the rights of the United States under the lease for real property between Terminal Realty Baltimore Co. and Terminal Realty Penn Co. and the United States, dated March 1, 1972, or any additions or modifications thereto. Permits the Architect of the Capitol to enter into a contract or other agreement with the Secretary of the Interior providing for the Architect of the Capitol to furnish steam from the Capitol Power Plant to the Union Station National Visitor Center complex."
