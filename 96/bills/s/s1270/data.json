    "text": "Basic Fuel Assistance Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, the Director of the Community Services Administration (CSA), and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to establish a Community outreach and information program to assist and encourage the low-income elderly and others eligible for assistance under this Act in obtaining Federal, State, or local energy-related assistance, including energy audits, counseling, educational services, alternate energy technologies, and weatherization. Establishes a program to provide assistance to such persons for meeting primary residential fuel costs. Sets forth criteria for determining the amount of such assistance, and requirements for eligibility. Directs the Secretary of HEW to contract with specified State agencies to administer and distribute such assistance payments, and authorizes reimbursement of 90 percent of the costs of such program administration. Sets forth a system of making payments to fuel suppliers supplying fuel to eligible recipients. Requires suppliers to keep full records and submit them to the Comptroller General as needed for auditing purposes. Prohibits suppliers from refusing to sell fuel to eligible participants solely on the basis of their participation in the basic fuel assistance program. Imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Director of CSA to establish a crisis intervention program to supplement the basic fuel assistance program with evacuations, emergency shelter, home repair, or payment of bills. Authorizes the appropriation of $40,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982, for such crisis intervention program."
