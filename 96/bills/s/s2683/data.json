Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to continue implementation of the comprehensive plan for the management of the public lands and their resources within such area pursuant to such Act. Directs the Secretary, within two years after the effective date of this section, to review the plan in effect on the effective date of this section to assure that it provides for protection and enhancement of the raptor population and habitat within a framework of multiple use and sustained yield. Requires the Secretary to review and revise such plan as necessary, but no less than once every four years. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this section with regard to management, use, and protection of the public lands, including the property located thereon, in the area. Sets forth penalties for violations of such rules or regulations. Withdraws, subject to valid existing rights, the area from operation of the mining laws and mineral exploration and development. Requires the head of any Federal agency with respect to any new project, program, or activity within the area, to provide for such conditions and restrictions as the Secretary determines in writing to be necessary to avoid any adverse effects on raptor habitat within the area. Permits any project, program, or activity in such area which the Secretary of Defense determines to be essential to the national defense mission. Requires the Secretary to review existing authorizations or agreements with the Idaho National Guard which provide for military maneuvers within the area and to provide for continuation of such use subject to such modification as the Secretary deems necessary. Requires the Secretary to provide for visitor use of the public lands within the area to such extent and in such manner as are consistent with protection of the raptors and the raptor habitat within the area. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to, and to enter into cooperative agreements and contracts with, the State and local governments providing for such governmental services as is necessary to carry out the purposes and policies of this Act."
