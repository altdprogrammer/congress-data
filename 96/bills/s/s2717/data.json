Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a lower aggregate acreage limitation for leases in areas known to contain deposits of tar sand. Directs the Secretary, under specified conditions, to extend a lease for not less than three years beyond its primary term in areas known to contain deposits of tar sand. Permits the owner of an oil and gas lease issued before the date of enactment of this Act to apply to the Secretary to convert the lease to a new combined hydrocarbon lease."
