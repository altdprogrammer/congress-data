    "date": "1979-04-23", 
    "text": "Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to revise the congressional findings and policies. Stipulates that a factor in administering export controls for foreign policy purposes is whether the goods and technology in question are available in other countries. Requires U.S. firms or entities to report to the Secretary of Commerce concerning any agreements with foreign agencies resulting in the export of unpublished technical data of U. S. origin. Makes the Secretary of State responsible for negotiations with other countries regarding their cooperation in restricting exports of goods and technical data which have significant military potential and would prove detrimental to U. S. security. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Commerce include an accounting of the use of technical advisory committees in a semiannual report to Congress and the President. Increases the penalties for violating such Act. Stipulates that the Secretary of Commerce (rather than the appropriate department head) is to decide whether withholding confidential information is contrary to the national interest. Repeals the requirements: (1) that a detailed statement concerning any simplification of reporting requirements be included in a quarterly report; (2) that the Secretary of Commerce review and report actions taken to simplify export regulations; and (3) that exporters be given information concerning their export license applications. Revises the reporting requirements to provide for annual reports to the President and Congress concerning implementation of this Act. Specifies the information to be contained in such report. Authorizes appropriations as necessary for the Departments of Commerce and State. Extends the authority granted by this Act to September 30, 1983. Declares the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 superseded."
