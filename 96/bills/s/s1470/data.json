Imposes criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations for allocating crude oil and petroleum product import sales. Limits the importation of such oil and products under such licenses to the aggregate number of barrels by category of crude oil and petroleum products imported into the United States during calendar year 1978. Sets forth requirements for issuing such licenses. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the amount of licensed imports cases of national emergency as determined by the President to insure access by the United States Armed Forces to needed supplies of such items. Authorizes the President to decrease the amount of licensed imports below the 1978 levels if required by treaty or international agreement. Terminates the provisions of this Act on December 31, 1985."
