    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Amends the Water Research and Development Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1981 and 1982 for: (1) water resources research and technology institutes and other qualified institutions; (2) water resources studies; (3) water research and development of saline waters; and (4) other water resources programs under such Act. Removes the limitation on the number of desalting plants demonstrating the engineering and economic viability of membrane and phase-change desalting processes to be constructed by the Secretary of the Interior. Specifies conditions such plants must meet. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct such demonstrations by means of cooperative agreements with non-Federal public entities. Requires reports to Congress concerning such plants to include information on how the proposed plant differs from others already constructed. Revises the terms of proposed contracts or cooperative agreements between the Secretary and a non-Federal entity to require such entity to provide between 15 and 35 percent of the total cost of the demonstration (presently such entity must pay all costs). Limits the Secretary's participation in the operation and maintenance of such demonstrations to four years. Repeals the requirement that the proposed contracts provide for a future right of the Federal Government to re-enter the facility. Increases the authorization of appropriations for such demonstration plants for the four year period of Federal participation in such costs, effective in fiscal year 1978. Authorizes the Secretary, when appropriations have been made for the commencement or continuation of design, construction, or operation and maintenance of any demonstration plan, to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements for miscellaneous services, materials and supplies, and construction, which may cover such periods of time as the Secretary may consider necessary but in which the liability of the United States shall be contingent upon appropriations being made therefor."
