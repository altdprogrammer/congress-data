Requires such plan to focus the combined efforts of the private and public sectors on such problem. Sets forth the composition of such Force, including representatives from specified Federal agencies. Sets forth the elements of such plan, including programs for: (1) establishing and operating a nationwide monitoring network; (2) identifying and measuring the sources of such precipitation; (3) understanding the airborne chemistry responsible for such precipitation; (4) assessing economic, social, health, and environmental impacts; (5) effecting scientific interchanges with appropriate foreign countries; (6) documenting all current Federal activities relevant to the problem; (7) considering various regulatory and nonregulatory solutions; (8) establishing performance evaluations standards; and (9) describing a role for affected and contributing States. Makes such plan the basis for determining goals and establishing diplomatic initiatives and bilateral treaties with other countries involved in acid precipitation programs. Requires the submission of such plan to Congress one year after the enactment and annually thereafter. Authorizes appropriations for the implementation of this Act for ten fiscal years. Stipulates that such funds be appropriated and administered through the Environmental Protection Agency."
