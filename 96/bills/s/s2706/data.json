    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-05-14", 
    "text": "Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program under which at least one United States observer will be stationed aboard each foreign fishing vessel while that vessel is within the fishery conservation zone and is: (1) engaging in fishing; (2) accepting United States harvested fish through transfer at sea; (3) cruising to and from a location at which any such fishing or transfer will transpire; or (4) taking highly migratory species if such taking may result in the incidental taking of species over which the United States exercises fishery management authority. Requires such observers, while aboard foreign fishing vessels, to carry out such scientific and other functions as the Secretary deems necessary. Requires the Secretary to impose, with respect to each foreign fishing vessel for which a permit is issued under such Act, a surcharge in an amount sufficient to cover all the costs of providing an observer aboard that vessel. Declares that the failure to pay any surcharge imposed shall be treated by the Secretary as a failure to pay the permit fee for such vessel. Requires the owner and operator of each fishing vessel to which an observer is assigned to reimburse the United States for the total costs of placing the observer aboard. Requires each such vessel to display an insignia that will indicate that such an observer is aboard. Requires the Secretary to provide such observers and observer assistants with necessary training. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to provide transportation for United States observers and observer assistants to and from foreign fishing vessels."
