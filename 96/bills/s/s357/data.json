    "text": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1980 - Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research and development, construction of facilities, and research program management. Permits appropriations for research and development to be used: (1) for any items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) which may be required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts; and (2) for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Stipulates that when so specified and to the extent provided in an appropriation Act, any amount appropriated for \"research and development\" or for \"construction of facilities\" may remain available without fiscal year limitation. Permits the funds for construction of any of specified facilities: (1) in the discretion of the NASA Administrator, to be varied upward ten percent; or (2) following a report by the Administrator to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the circumstances of such action, to be varied upward 25 percent to meet unusual cost variations. Limits the total cost of all construction work to the total of the amounts specified. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development to be transferred to the \"construction of facilities\" appropriation. Authorizes the expenditure of such funds, together with $10,000,000 of the funds appropriated for construction of facilities, to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations. Disallows any amount appropriated pursuant to this Act from being used for any program deleted by the Congress from requests as originally made to either the House Committee on Science and Technology or the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Disallows any amounts appropriated pursuant to this Act from being used for any program in excess of the amount actually authorized for that particular program for research and development or research and program management. Disallows any amount from being used for any program which has not been presented to or requested of such committees, with certain exceptions. Expresses the sense of the Congress that it is in the national interest that consideration be given to geographical distribution of Federal research funds whenever feasible, and that NASA should explore ways and means of distributing its research and development funds whenever feasible. Authorizes NASA to provide liability insurance for any user of a space vehicle to compensate all or a portion of claims by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from activities carried on in connection with the launch, operations, or recovery of the space vehicle."
