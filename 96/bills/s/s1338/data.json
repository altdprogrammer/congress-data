    "text": "Industrial Equipment Efficiency Act of 1979 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to prescribe standard, labeling rules, or guidelines for each standard classification of industrial equipment, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, where such standards, rules, or guidelines would result in: (1) improvements in energy efficiency which are technologically feasible and economically justified with respect to such class; and (2) significant energy savings. Sets forth the factors the Administrator must consider in determining what is economically justified, including: (1) the economic impact of such standards on the manufacturers and purchasers of the equipment subject to such standard; (2) the savings in operating costs over the life of the equipment; (3) the lessening of the utility or the performance of the equipment likely to result; (4) the impact on competition; and (5) the need of the Nation to conserve energy. Requires manufacturers of industrial equipment to submit to the Administrator any information or reports considered necessary to assist in establishing test procedures, labeling rules, or energy efficiency standards. Directs the Administrator to prescribe test procedures for each standard classification before promulgating any rule requiring energy efficiency labeling or establishing energy efficiency standards. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate labeling guidelines for the use of manufacturers of a class of industrial equipment wherever it is determined that mandatory labeling rules are not likely to be necessary to encourage the availability of information concerning energy efficiency. Stipulates that either mandatory labeling rules or guidelines, where appropriate, be promulgated within three years of the enactment of the Energy Conservation Act of 1979. Directs the Administrator to prescribe energy efficiency standards for certain classes of industrial equipment at varying times after the promulgation of test procedures and labeling rules for such classes. Sets forth the procedures the Administrator must follow in promulgating such standards, including notice requirements and the opportunity for public comment. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress, within two years of the enactment of the Energy Conservation Act of 1979, a report on improvements in energy efficiency of industrial equipment. Establishes civil monetary penalties for violations of rules promulgated pursuant to this Act. Vests jurisdiction for such violations in the appropriate United States district court. Exempts industrial equipment manufactured, sold, held or intended for export from the labeling requirements and/or standards prescribed by this Act. Prohibits the import of industrial equipment not in compliance with such requirements, except as the Secretary of Treasury may authorize. Establishes an appeals process for those persons adversely affected by such requirements. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
