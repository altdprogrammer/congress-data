    "text": "Food Stamp Accountability Act of 1980 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to adjust the costs of the thrifty food plan and the amount of the standard deduction annually rather than semiannually. Disqualifies from the food stamp program any individual enrolled in an institution of higher education. Requires that each State agency determine the eligibility of each applicant household by verifying specified income in part through the use of information obtained from other government agencies' records. Permits the State agency to verify prior to certification the size of any applicant household and any factors of eligibility involving households which fall within such agency's error-prone household profiles. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit the Commissioner of Social Security to disclose to the Department of Agriculture and to a State food stamp agency information from individual income tax returns with respect to net earnings from self-employment and payments of retirement income which have been disclosed to the Social Security Administration, but only to the extent necessary to determine an individual's eligibility for food stamp benefits. Requires the appropriate State agency to disclose to the Secretary of Agriculture or to any State food stamp agency specified information respecting wages, unemployment compensation, and whether an individual has refused an offer of employment to the extent necessary to determine an individual's eligibility for benefits. Directs the Secretary of Labor to withhold payments from a State which does not substantially comply with such requirements. Requires each State agency to issue a photographic identification card to be presented by any member of a household when utilizing the household authorization card to receive coupons when such household is located in a city of a specified size. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Labor to reimburse specified agencies and organizations operating specified pilot projects involving work for 50 percent of all administrative costs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study and report to the appropriate committees of Congress the feasibility of issuing coupons bearing the identification number ascribed to the participating household."
