Revises the tax treatment of capital losses of noncorporate taxpayers by providing that such losses shall be allowed only to the extent of long-term capital gains, plus the smaller of the taxpayer's taxable income reduced by his zero bracket amount, or $3,000 ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return). Provides for a one year carryover of excess long-term capital losses."
