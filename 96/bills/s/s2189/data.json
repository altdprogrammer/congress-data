Authorizes States to enter into compacts providing for the establishment and operation of regional low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Directs that a compact shall not be effective until Congress consents to same. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in order to assist the States in the above policy, to prepare and submit to Congress and to each State a report which: (1) defines the needed low-level present and future waste capacity; (2) defines the status of all commercial low-level radioactive waste disposal sites; (3) evaluates the transportation requirements for the shipment of wastes; and (4) evaluates disposal facilities owned and operated by the Department of Energy."
