Includes in such Office: (1) a United States Intelligence Board (USIB), consisting of the heads of the entities in the intelligence community, to coordinate U.S. intelligence activities; and (2) a Board of Presidential Estimates, appointed by the Director, to prepare briefings on intelligence for the President and the National Security Council. Sets forth the duties of the Director, including to: (1) inform the President of views and developments within the community; (2) make budgetary recommendations for the community; (3) provide the President and Congress with an annual assessment of the community's effectiveness; (4) promulgate regulations governing the classification of sensitive information; (5) coordinate technical services needed by the community; and (6) perform other duties as the President may prescribe. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence, at the request of the National Security Council, to produce Presidential intelligence estimates. Requires the Director to ensure that diverse points of view within the community are presented. Establishes a nine-member National Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, appointed by the President, to evaluate continually the effectiveness of the intelligence community. Directs the Board to report its findings from time to time to the President and the congressional intelligence committees. Establishes a five-member Intelligence Oversight Board, appointed by the President, to investigate allegations of illegal, unethical, or improper activities of any entity in the intelligence community. Directs the head of each entity of the community to establish, subject to the approval of the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General, guidelines with respect to the following collection methods that may be used against a \"U.S. person\": (1) intrusive and other covert or clandestine techniques; (2) informants and undercover agents; (3) examination of third-party records, including telephone bills, medical records, and hotel registrations; and (4) public information sources. Prohibits the nonconsensual use of such methods except in accordance with the guidelines. Requires the guidelines to: (1) take into account such person's constitutional rights; (2) specify the official who must authorize the collection activity; and (3) be reasonably designed to match the acquisition of information with U.S. security needs. Prohibits the use of intrusive techniques against any U.S. person to obtain foreign intelligence while such person is in the United States unless the President determines that it is necessary to obtain intelligence essential to the national security and which cannot be obtained by less intrusive methods. Restricts the dissemination of intelligence information with respect to a U.S. person by the United States Counterintelligence Office. Authorizes the head of each entity of the intelligence community to classify information in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Director of National Intelligence. Subjects any person, who discloses classified information to a person unauthorized to receive it, to the current penalties for the offense of delivering defense information to aid a foreign government. Exempts the intelligence community from any laws requiring disclosure of information with respect to information in files specifically designated by the Director of National Intelligence to be concerned with: (1) technical systems for the collection of intelligence information; (2) special and foreign intelligence activities; (3) investigations for determining the suitability of intelligence sources; and (4) liaison or information arrangements with foreign governments. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act to repeal the Hughes-Ryan amendment of 1974 (conditioning the funding of covert CIA operations on reporting to the \"appropriate\" congressional committees).

Title II: Central Intelligence Analysis Agency - Establishes a Central Intelligence Analysis Agency headed by a Director appointed by the President for a single ten-year term.

Directs the Agency to: (1) develop the capabilities to influence events outside the United States so that the role of the Government is not revealed or acknowledged and to undertake special activities as the President may order; and (2) conduct intelligence activities in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation as necessary and appropriate to carry out its duties. Requires the Director to report its activities at least annually to the congressional intelligence committees. Authorizes the Agency to: (1) permit its employees to use covert techniques anywhere in the world which the Director determines are necessary to accomplish the Agency's mission; and (2) engage in intelligence activity outside the United States, other than intelligence gathering, which is approved by the President and with respect to which the intelligence committees are notified as soon as practicable. Establishes within the Agency the Contingency Reserve Fund for activities to accomplish the Agency's mission. Permits particular aliens and their families to be given entry into the United States for permanent residence without regard to their inadmissibility under the immigration laws, upon the determination by the Director, with the approval of the Attorney General, that their admission is in the interest of national security or essential to intelligence activities. Title V: Federal Bureau of Investigation - Directs the FBI to: (1) perform intelligence and counterintelligence activities to safeguard the United States from foreign agents working in the United States against its interests and from terrorists; and (2) collect and disseminate intelligence to counter terrorism and conduct other activities to achieve the purposes of this Act. Requires that all FBI counterintelligence and counterterrorist activities outside the United States be conducted in coordination with the Foreign Intelligence Agency. Requires such operations within the United States by other Federal agencies be coordinated with the FBI.
