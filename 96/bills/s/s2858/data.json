    "text": "Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 to authorize holders of leases of oil shale lands to lease additional lands for purposes connected with operations pursuant to an oil shale lease. Limits such additional leases to no more than 6,400 acres. Provides that land leased pursuant to this Act may not be used for oil shale mining but may be used for any other purpose authorized by the Secretary of the Interior. Prohibits the Secretary from granting an additional lease unless the Secretary: (1) has consulted with the Governors of the States in which such lands are located; (2) is satisfied that the additional land is needed for proper operations under the oil shale lease; and (3) has determined that the issuance of the additional lease is in the public interest. Establishes guidelines for other lease provisions including rent, duration, and environmental protection requirements."
