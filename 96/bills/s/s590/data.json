Authorizes the Secretary to exempt from the national standards clinical laboratories which: (1) are operated by a licensed physician, dentist, or podiatrist, or a group of such practitioners, or in a rural health clinic, and in which the only tests or procedures performed are performed under the supervision of such a practitioner (or practitioners) or clinic in connection with the treatment of their patients; (2) are owned or operated by a State, or any political subdivision of a State, and which do not perform laboratory services for which payments are received under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act; (3) perform tests or procedures primarily for biomedical or behavioral research; or (4) perform tests or procedures only to assist insurers with respect to insurance contracts. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with: (1) qualified private nonprofit organizations to administer tests and make inspections as provided for under this Act; and (2) States to administer the licensure program provided in this Act under the Medicare program. Subjects Federal clinical laboratories under the jurisdiction of the Secretary to the national standards, with certain exceptions.

Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts with public and nonprofit private entities for projects and studies on laboratory methodology and utilization. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress with respect to the accuracy and costs of laboratory tests and procedures during the previous fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies of: (1) existing voluntary certification standards and State licensure laws for laboratory personnel; (2) qualifications of entities that certify such personnel; (3) existing and proposed public and private mechanisms to determine the continued competence of such personnel; (4) existing laboratory proficiency testing methods; and (5) the relationship of requirements for such personnel and of clinical laboratory proficiency testing requirements with clinical laboratory performance. Specifies analyses to be included in such studies, and directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the results of the studies. Requires the Secretary to reimburse to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund any amount expended from such funds with respect to the licensing of non-Medicare laboratories. Repeals the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress with respect to the exemption of laboratories from the standards under this Act.
