    "text": "Savings and Investment Encouragement Act of 1979 - Title I: Incentives for Individual Saving - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income up to $100 of the interest earned on a savings account. Permits an exclusion of up to $500 for interest which is reinvested in a savings account. Excludes from gross income up to $500 of dividends received which are reinvested in the stock of domestic corporations. Requires that the sum of the adjusted basis of stock in domestic corporations held by the taxpayer plus the amount held in a savings account (investment base) on the last day of a taxable year exceed the investment base of the taxpayer as of the first day of such taxable year, plus the amount of dividends and interest excludible for such taxable year. Title II: Incentives for New Plant and Equipment - Revises the method for determining useful lives of business assets for purposes of computing allowable depreciation deductions. Replaces the asset depreciation range (ADR) method with a schedule of capital cost recovery periods for three classes of business property. Establishes capital cost recovery periods for the following classes of business property: (1) buildings and their structural components, ten years; (2) tangible property, five years; and (3) automobiles, taxis, and light-duty trucks (up to $100,000), three years. Allows a ten percent investment tax credit for buildings and tangible property, and a six percent credit for automobiles, taxis, and light-duty trucks. Requires the recapture of depreciation amounts and investment tax credit amounts applicable to assets which are sold or otherwise disposed of prior to the expiration of the cost recovery period. Permits taxpayer to deduct less than the full allowance for capital cost recovery in any taxable year. Permits a carryover to succeeding taxable years of any unused depreciation amounts. Disqualifies capital cost recovery property from the allowance for first year depreciation. Treats amounts claimed as the capital cost recovery of noncorporate lessors as an item of tax preference for purposes of the minimum tax. Adopts as an accounting practice the \"half year convention\" under which investments eligible for capital cost recovery treatment or the investment tax credit which are made at any time during the taxable year are deemed to be made in the middle of such year. Title III: Incentives for Research and Development - Qualifies research and development expenditures related to a trade or business for the investment tax credit."
