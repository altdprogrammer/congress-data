    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-04-15", 
    "text": "Postal Service Act of 1980 - Subjects the United States Postal Service to the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Authorizes the Postal Service to employ attorneys, without the consent of the Attorney General, to conduct litigation brought by or against the Postal Service under the provisions of such Act. Directs the Postal Service to submit an annual report to Congress on: (1) the number of work-related injuries and illnesses; and (2) actions taken to improve occupational health and safety. Establishes a civil penalty of not to exceed $10,000 to be assessed against any person who violates a mail stop order issued by the Postal Service. Directs the Postal Service: (1) to notify a person of charges of such a violation; (2) upon the request of such person, to order a hearing on such violation; and (3) to notify the person of any decision to impose a penalty. Provides for the judicial review of such a decision. Authorizes the Postal Service to demand: (1) to purchase any article or service offered for sale by mail; or (2) access to records pertaining to any advertising claim for such product or service. Declares that failure to comply with such a demand shall be treated as probable cause of a violation of postal law concerning false representations. Authorizes the Postal Service: (1) to assess civil penalties of up to 100 percent of the unpaid postage against mail users who fail to affix lawful postage; and (2) to suspend permits for mailing without postage stamps if the permit holders fail to pay such a penalty. Authorizes annual appropriations of $920,000,000 for the public service costs to the Postal Service of maintaining regular nationwide service. Requires that a portion of such funds be expended to conduct a research and development program regarding improved methods of postal service. Directs the Postal Service: (1) to submit a plan for such program to Congress by January 15, 1981; and (2) to report annually to Congress on the activities conducted under such program. Requires the Postal Service to include in its annual comprehensive statement to Congress certain postal planning information including plans for service cutbacks, capital improvement projects, and rate requirements projected over the next three years. Revises procedures relating to mail classification. Requires that the domestic mail classification schedule (schedule) describe the categories of mail service sufficiently to delineate the classes and subclasses to which rates and fees apply. Directs the Postal Service to publish in the Federal Register any proposed change in the schedule. Requires the Postal Rate Commission to establish expedited procedures for the review of Postal Service proposals for changes in the text of the schedule. Requires that such procedures provide for a public hearing on such a proposal upon the request of an interested party. Directs the Commission: (1) within 90 days after a proposal is published, to determine whether such proposal is likely to have an adverse impact on competition in providing postal services; (2) upon determining that no adverse impact will result, to notify the Board of Governors which may instruct the Postal Service to issue a rule adopting such proposal; and (3) upon determining that an adverse impact will result, to follow the normal review procedure for Postal Service proposals. Authorizes the Postal Service to propose experimental mail classifications and accompanying rates and fees for services not available under the schedule. Requires the Commission to complete a review of such an experimental proposal, according to specified criteria, within 60 days. Allows the Postal Service to implement the proposal for a period not to exceed two years if the Commission finds the proposed change to be properly designated as an experiment. Permits schools, libraries, and nonprofit organizations to mail books, films, sound recordings, and other types of educational materials at the \"library\" rate. Includes teaching aids, guides, and catalogs as eligible for such rate. Revises the budget procedures for the Commission. Requires the Comptroller General to audit and report to Congress on the accounts and operations of the Commission. Sets forth additional qualifications for Governors of the Postal Service and Postal Rate Commissioners. Prohibits the appointment of a former employee of the Postal Service or the Commission as a Governor or Commissioner for five years after the termination of such employment. Permits a Governor to serve up to one year after the expiration of his or her term if a successor has not qualified. Empowers Postal Service security guards and employees performing duties relating to the inspection of postal matters, while on Postal Service property: (1) to enforce Federal laws and Postal Service regulations for the protection of persons and property; (2) to make arrests; and (3) to serve warrants. Prescribes penalties for violations of any law governing Postal Service property. Authorizes the Postal Service to establish size and weight limitations for mail matter by following the same procedures for making mail classification changes."
