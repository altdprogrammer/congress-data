Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to promote the formation of export trade associations consistent with such Act and the antitrust laws. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission Chairman, and the Attorney General to meet periodically: (1) to avoid conflicting positions regarding oversight of such associations; and (2) with the private sector, to review export trade policy. Makes the Department of Commerce (presently, the Federal Trade Commission) responsible for: (1) receiving information filed by export trade associations; and (2) investigating whether any such association is in restraint of trade."
