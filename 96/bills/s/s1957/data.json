    "text": "Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Act of 1979 - Amends the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 to include in the definitions of the terms \"United States\" and \"State\" the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction. Directs the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to implement and administer a national recreational boating safety and facilities improvement program. Authorizes the Secretary to allocate funds to States for accepted State recreational boating safety and facilities improvement programs if sufficient State matching funds are available. Directs the Secretary to accept State programs that include: (1) an approved vessel numbering system; (2) a cooperative boating safety assistance program with the Coast Guard; (3) sufficient patrol to enforce applicable State laws; (4) boating safety education; (5) a State agency to implement or coordinate the program and report to the Secretary; and (6) facilities improvement. Sets forth formulas for the allocation of funds among the States. Establishes in the Treasury a National Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Fund from which the Secretary may allocate funds for accepted State programs. Requires that revenues attributable to the taxes on special motor fuels and gasoline used in motorboats be covered into such Fund. Authorizes appropriations for such State programs of $30,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1981 through 1984. Amends the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer certain amounts from the taxes received from special motor fuels and gasoline used in motorboats to the National Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Fund."
