Directs the Institute to: (1) direct a national assistance program to assure persons ready access to a fair and effective system of justice; (2) foster coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary; (3) make recommendations concerning the proper allocation of responsibility between the State and Federal court systems; (4) promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrine to an independent judiciary; and (5) encourage education for State court judges and support personnel. Authorizes the Institute to award grants and enter into cooperative agreements or contracts to: (1) conduct research, demonstrations, or special projects relating to the purposes of this Act; (2) serve as a clearinghouse of information regarding State judicial systems; (3) participate in joint projects with other agencies, including the Federal Judicial Center; (4) evaluate the impact of programs carried out under this Act upon the quality of criminal, civil, and juvenile justice; (5) encourage judicial education; (6) serve in a consulting capacity to State and local justice systems; and (7) be responsible for the certification of national programs to improve State judicial systems. Requires the Institute to incorporate in any grant or contract awarded to a State or local judicial system the requirement that such recipient provide a 25 percent match. Permits waiver of such requirement in \"exceptionally rare\" circumstances. Prohibits the Institute from interfering with the independent nature of any State judicial system. Authorizes necessary appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to carry out this Act."
