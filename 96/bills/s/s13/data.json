Allows exceptions to such limitation in national emergencies declared by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress. Sets forth the following provisions governing the consideration of any concurrent resolution on the budget that carries a deficit beginning in fiscal year 1980: (1) approval requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses; (2) such resolution will be considered out of order if a deficit existed in any of the preceding four years; and (3) such deficit must be cancelled within two fiscal years."
