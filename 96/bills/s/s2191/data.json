Exempts from such standards manufacturers whose domestically manufactured production commenced after a specified date. States that the failure of any manufacturer to comply with any average fuel economy standard shall not be deemed unlawful conduct if the manufacturer has sufficient credits or time in which to gain such credits to offset the amount or any penalty which would otherwise be assessed. Permits credits earned for exceeding the required fuel economy levels for any given model year to be used to offset any penalties such manufacturer may have incurred for the three consecutive model years prior to such year or any penalties such manufacturer may incur in the succeeding three consecutive model years."
