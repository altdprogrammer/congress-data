    "text": "Food and Population Centers Act - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), in cooperation with the Secretary of State, to contract with land-grant institutions for evaluations of food needs and agricultural development in countries requesting such evaluations. States the goals of such evaluations. Directs the Secretary to make grants to land-grant institutions to cover costs of the evaluation and development of plans to establish agriculture and food centers in any country and proportionate costs of associated food and population programs. Sets forth the functions of such centers. States the requirements of such plans, including analyses of resource needs. Prescribes the procedure for applying for such planning grants. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to land-grant institutions to establish and operate food and population centers. Requires host countries of such centers to agree to match the U.S. contribution, in either resources or services, for any necessary costs. Sets a minimum level of ten percent for contribution by the host country. Empowers the Secretary to close any center upon a determination that the agreement has been seriously breached or when conditions no longer require a center. Requires the Secretary, where an agreement has been entered into, to make grants to the land-grant institution involved. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress regarding the centers established under this Act. Terminates funding ten years after the date of enactment unless further authorized."
