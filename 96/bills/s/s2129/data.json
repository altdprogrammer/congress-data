    "text": "Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to set forth regulations relating to joint studies and review by State and Federal authorities of State control programs to protect underground sources of drinking water from contamination resulting from the underground injection of substances for the purposes of waste storage or oil and natural gas recovery. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to implement regulations if the Administrator determines State programs to protect underground water sources to be ineffective. Prohibits the Administrator from implementing such regulations unless a negative determination of the effectiveness of State programs is made by the Administrator based upon the joint Federal-State studies. Provides for judicial review of all determinations of the Administrator as to the effectiveness and adequacy of State underground water protection programs. Sets forth requirements for receipt by the States of Federal grants for public water system supervision programs."
