    "text": "Rural Areas and Small Cities Energy Savings Act of 1980 - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and conduct a weatherization program to make grants which finance the purchase and/or installation of weatherization materials in dwellings occupied by low-income persons in rural areas. Directs the Secretary to give priority to the weatherization of those units occupied by the low-income elderly or handicapped persons. Requires the Secretary to coordinate such efforts with those conducted pursuant to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976. Limits such grants to $1,500 per unit. Requires rural electric cooperatives and nonprofit community based organizations which have applied to and been approved by the Secretary for participation in such program to conduct energy audits of eligible units for participation in such program. Permits such cooperatives and organizations to pool funds received from the Farmers Home Administration to conduct the necessary weatherization work. Sets forth the division of labor on such projects for paid and volunteer workers. Limits the percentage of funds which may be used for administrative expenses."
