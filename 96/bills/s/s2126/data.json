Provides that upon written agreement to cancel such leases such party shall be issued: (1) a noncompetitive lease or leases for federal coal deposits that cannot be mined efficiently or economically unless incorporated into an existing mining unit controlled by the party; or (2) a certificate of bidding rights to acquire coal leases at competitive sales. States that such leases shall be issued at fair market value and certificates shall have the value of the party's investment plus specified compounded interest."
