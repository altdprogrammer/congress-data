    "text": "Title I: Amendments to Small Business Administration Business Lending Authority - Amends the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to consolidate measures governing the granting of loans by the Small Business Administration to: (1) small businesses; and to (2) State and local development companies. Increases the total amount of loans which may be made to a borrower other than a State or local development company. Repeals measures which established unique programs for: (1) trade adjustment loans made to assist any firm to adjust to changed economic conditions resulting from increased competition from imported articles; (2) loans for businesses made with emphasis on the preservation or establishment of small business concerns located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals or owned by low-income individuals; and (3) loans for small businesses involved in solar energy, other forms of renewable energy, and energy conservation. Prohibits the application of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to any agreement to make or guarantee any assistance under the Small Business Act. Eliminates certain requirements of the annual report made by the SBA to the President and the Congress."
