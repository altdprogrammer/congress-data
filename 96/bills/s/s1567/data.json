    "text": "Establishes the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area in the State of Oregon to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue permits or to contract for the quarrying of materials from the area in accordance with a management plan to be developed by the Secretary and any other terms and conditions necessary to protect the value of such quarry lands. Revokes the reservation of lands for lighthouse purposes made by Executive order, and restores such lands to the status of public lands, with specified reservations. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study relating to the use of such quarry lands for wind energy research, and authorizes the Secretary to issue permits for the use of such lands as a site for installation and field testing of an experimental wind turbine generating system upon a determination that such activities would not impair the value of such lands. Directs the Secretary to establish a reclamation and restoration program for lands affected by quarrying operations. Stipulates that money received by the United States in connection with such quarrying shall be deposited in a special fund account established by the Secretary of the Treasury for use for reclamation and restoration."
