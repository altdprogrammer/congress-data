Directs the Secretary to amend existing water service contracts upon request of the contracting organization or any excess landowner to permit water service to lands exceeding such limitation at twice the rate for nonexcess lands. Directs the Secretary in entering construction cost repayment contracts or contracts to recover the annual operating and maintenance costs of a project to require either or both: (1) the sale of excess lands at a price approved by the Secretary; and/or (2) the furnishing of water service to excess lands on a reasonable pro rata basis determined by the Secretary. Permits contracting organizations and excess landowners to request an adjustment of existing repayment contracts to reflect the provisions of this Act provided the costs of previously furnished water service to excess lands are repaid."
