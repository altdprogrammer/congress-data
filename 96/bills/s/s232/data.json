    "text": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends title XI of the Public Health Service Act (Genetic Diseases, Hemophilia Programs, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) to revise the current information services program with respect to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), including requirements that: (1) a reporting system to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare be implemented; (2) coordinated clearinghouse activities be carried out on all aspects of SIDS; and (3) grant applications provide for parent self-help group involvement. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to: (1) submit annually to the appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive report on the administration of the program, including the extent of allocations made to rural and urban areas; and (2) conduct a study on State laws, practices, and systems relating to death investigation and their impact on sudden infant deaths and report the results to Congress. Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations for such program in the following amounts: $7,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, and $9,000,000 for fiscal year 1981. Directs the Secretary to distribute such appropriations equitably among the regions of the Nations. Directs the Secretary to assure that there are applied adequate amounts from sums appropriated to the national institute on Child Health and Human Development to make maximum feasible progress toward the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome, and to report to the appropriate congressional committees with respect to sudden infant death syndrome research."
