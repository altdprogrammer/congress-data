    "text": "Military Construction Authorization Act, 1981 - Title I: Army - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to establish or develop military installations and facilities at specified locations. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts for each of these locations. Authorizes the Secretary to establish or develop other installations by proceeding with construction made necessary by unforeseen security considerations, new weapons development, new and unforeseen research and development requirements, improved production schedules or revisions in the tasks or functions assigned to a military installation or for environmental considerations if the Secretary of Defense determines that deferral of such construction for inclusion in the next Military Construction Authorization Act would be inconsistent with the national security. Authorizes appropriations for such emergency construction. Title II: Navy - Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to establish or develop military installations and facilities at specified locations. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts for each such location. Authorizes the Secretary to establish or develop other installations where necessary under the same conditions as those relating to the Secretary of the Army under title I of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to contract for the construction of the Air Passenger Terminal in Keflavik, Iceland. Stipulates that the United States share of such construction costs shall not exceed $20,000,000. Title III: Air Force - Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to establish or develop military installations and facilities at specified locations. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts for each such location. Authorizes the Secretary to establish or develop additional facilities where necessitated by those factors enumerated in title I of this Act.

Title V: North Atlantic Treaty Organization Infrastructure - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to incur NATO facilities construction costs of up to $300,000,000. Requires the Secretary to report to the Senate and the House Armed Services and Appropriations Committees concerning such costs. Title VI: Military Family Housing - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to construct or acquire military family housing. Authorizes appropriations for such housing at specified locations in the U.S. and overseas. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) improve existing quarters; and (2) provide for advance planning and construction design, including architectural and engineering services. Limits the amounts that may be expended for such purposes. Amends the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1968, to increase the cost limitation on certain home repairs from $10,000 to $20,000. Replaces the dual structure of monthly maximum lease payments for military family housing in the United States, Puerto Rico, or Guam with a single maximum payment, of $515. Stipulates that the Secretary may exceed such maximum (up to $600 per unit) for up to 500 units. Increases such payments from $850 to $1115 for military family housing in foreign countries. Makes occupants liable for damage to military family housing. Allows contractor claims (relating to such housing) to proceed even though settlement of such claims would exceed spending limitations. Authorizes the Secretary to complete housing construction in Oahu, Hawaii, notwithstanding specified cost limitations. Amends the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1979, to increase the funding limit for the Naval Facility, Centerville Beach, California, from $1,509,000 to $2,030,000. Title VII: Authorization of Appropriations and Administrative Provisions - Authorizes the Secretaries of the various military departments to develop installations under this Act without regard to provisions of law which prohibit the advancement of public moneys and which require the submission of detailed cost estimates to Congress. Establishes expenditure ceilings for each title of this Act. Authorizes limited increases in the amounts authorized pursuant to this Act if the Secretary of the military department or the Director of the defense agency concerned determines that such an increase is required for the sole purpose of meeting unusual and unanticipated variations in costs. Directs the Secretary of Defense to encourage the use of solar energy for projects authorized by this Act and authorizes the Secretary to increase the cost limitations or floor area limitations for a project in order to equip it with solar energy heating or cooling equipment. Establishes measures and responsibility for supervising the construction work authorized under this Act. Repeals prior Military Construction Authorization Acts. Specifies exceptions to such repealer.
