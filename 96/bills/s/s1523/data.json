Directs that within the Office of the Chief Medical Director of the VA one Assistant Chief Medical Director shall be doctor of geriatrics, and shall be responsible for the VA's geriatric services. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to designate 15 VA hospitals as demonstration centers of geriatric research, education, and clinical operations. Stipulates that such centers shall operate until September 30, 1983. Directs the Administrator to provide that: (1) each hospital operating as a geriatric center on the date of enactment of this Act be designated as the location for a demonstration center; and (2) such designated hospitals be geographically dispersed across the United States. Directs the Administrator to establish a Geriatrics and Extended Care Task Force within the VA's Special Medical Advisory Group. Stipulates that such Task Force shall assess: (1) the VA's capability to provide geriatric services on a sustained and growing basis to eligible veterans; and (2) the current and projected needs for geriatric and extended health services among eligible veterans. Requires such Task Force to submit a report to the Administrator and the Special Medical Advisory Group within 18 months after the effective date of this Act. Directs the Administrator to transmit such report, (within 90 days of receipt) along with any comments, to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees. Requires a final report to be submitted by such Task Force within four years of the effective date of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of: (1) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1980; (2) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1981; (3) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1982; and (4) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1983."
