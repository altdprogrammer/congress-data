Permits the President to suspend a proclamation limiting meat imports to permit such suspension only during a period of national emergency or when supply is inadequate to meet domestic demands at reasonable prices due to a natural disaster. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to study the regional economic impact of meat imports and report the results to the appropriate committees of Congress by December 31, 1980."
