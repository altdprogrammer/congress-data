Directs agencies to share information and to refrain from demanding any information already available through another agency. Requires Congress to include in the committee report of legislation an estimate of the costs to private business of any reporting requirements which demand new information. Directs the General Accounting Office to report to Congress on the extent to which Federal agencies require duplicate information, and on the feasibility of establishing a central data bank of information provided by businesses."
