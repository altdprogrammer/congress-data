Directs the Secretary to set production goals for the production of such fuels for each of calendar years 1985 through 1990. Requires that domestic refiners of crude petroleum products include, as part of the raw material feed into their refining processes, specified percentages of synthetic fuel. Requires such refiners to make annual reports to the Secretary on the percentage of synthetic fuel used in refinery operations during the preceding year. Imposes civil penalties for violations of such requirements, and sets forth procedures for the assessment and collection of such penalties."
