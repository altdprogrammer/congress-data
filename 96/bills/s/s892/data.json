Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for pilot projects for the production of industrial hydrocarbons and alcohols from agricultural commodities and forest products through loan guarantees. Sets the total amount of such guaranteed loans at $500,000,000. Requires the Secretary: (1) to give priority to projects that will use Government price-supported commodities; and (2) to assure that the guarantees are for projects that will result in new and innovative technologies for the production of industrial hydrocarbons and alcohols."
