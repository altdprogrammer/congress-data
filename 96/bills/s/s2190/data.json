    "text": "Increases the basic pay and allowance rate in effect as of January 1, 1980, to the amount that would have been granted Federal employees if the President had not submitted an alternate pay plan for pay grades E-4 through E-9, W-1 through W-4, and 0-3 through 0-5. Authorizes additional station housing allowances to be paid to military personnel stationed in the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) where the actual housing costs exceed by more than 15 percent the housing allowance provided. Replaces fixed travel reimbursement schedules with ones to be determined by the Secretaries of the military departments. Eliminates \"first-class transportation, including sleeping accommodations\" as a factor in determining such reimbursement rates. Includes \"common carrier transportation\" and \"high cost areas\" as factors in determining such rates."
