    "date": "1980-06-21", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-1119) Priority Energy Project Act of 1980 - =Title I: General Provisions= - Declares it to be the purpose of this act to reduce the threat of economic disruption from oil supply interruptions by providing a coordinated, prompt, and simplified process for the consideration of certain nonnuclear energy projects that are to be designated as Priority Energy Projects. Sets forth definitions of terms, including \"energy project\" which is to mean any project by any person or any Federal or non-Federal agency which is for the: (1) exploration for; or (2) development, transportation production, conservation or efficient use of, any form of energy. States that a \"Priority Energy Project\" is any project designated as such pursuant to this Act. Provides that nothing in this Act shall apply to any project for the production of nuclear energy. =Title II: Energy Mobilization Board= - Establishes the Energy Mobilization Board consisting of three members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that the Board shall have authority to: (1) hold hearings; (2) enter into and perform contracts; (3) utilize the services of voluntary personnel; (4) acquire and dispose of personal property; and (5) prescribe orders and regulations necessary to operate the Board. Prohibits the Board from constructing, maintaining, or operating any energy project. Sets forth provisions concerning the administration of the Board. Requires that certain final actions of the Board shall be subject to the Sunshine Act, including: (1) a determination whether or not to designate an energy project as a Priority Energy Project; (2) establishment or modification of a Project Decision Schedule; (3) a determination to require Federal agencies to adopt modified procedures; or (4) a determination to make a recommendation to the President. Directs the Board, from time to time, to determine other actions which shall be subject to the Sunshine Act. Provides that, except as stipulated, the Administrative Procedure Act shall apply to the Energy Mobilization Board. Terminates the authority of the Board to designate Priority Energy Projects eight years after enactment. Terminates the Board 90 days after the later of: (1) the eight year period; or (2) initial operation, or termination of the designation, of all priority Energy Projects designated by the Board. =Title III: Priority Energy Projects= - Authorizes any person or any Federal or non-Federal agency planning or proposing an energy project to apply to the Board for an order designating the project as a Priority Energy Project. Sets forth information required of applicants. Requires the Board to approve or deny the application within 45 days after expiration of the public comment period. Requires the Board, in determining whether to make the designation, to consider, among other things: (1) the extent to which the project would reduce dependence on imported oil or nonrenewable resources; (2) the magnitude of any economic, social, and environmental impacts as associated with the project; (3) the extent to which the project would use renewable resources, conserve energy, and contribute to the development of new technology; (4) any adverse effects of designating the project as a Priority Energy Project; and (5) the anticipated effects of such designation upon competition in the energy industry. Requires the Board to designate an electric powerplant applying for designation as a Priority Energy Project if determined that such powerplant will use coal or a coal derived fuel as the primary energy source either through: (1) the conversion of an existing powerplant from the use of oil or natural gas as a primary energy source or (2) the construction of a new powerplant to replace an existing powerplant which uses oil or natural gas as the primary source. Authorizes the Governor of any State in which there is a Priority Energy Project to appoint a nonvoting representative to the Board in matters respecting such project. Requires each agency having authority to make any agency decision with respect to any part of a project designated as a Priority Energy Project to transmit to the Board: (1) a compilation of all significant actions required to be taken by such agency and by the applicant before such decision can be made and a summary of procedural requirements applicable to such actions; (2) a tentative schedule for completing such actions and making such decisions; and (3) a statement of administrative requirements to take such actions. Directs the Board to publish a Project Decision Schedule for all agency decisions and actions relating to a Project within 30 days of the transmittal of agency information. Requires that such schedule: (1) be consistent with tentative schedules; (2) be reasonably designed to ensure that the agency is able to comply with all applicable laws; and (3) ensure that the agency is able to afford adequate participation as required by all applicable laws. Permits the Board to modify the Schedule at any time, upon its own motion or upon petition of an agency, the Project, or any party to an agency proceeding, if: (1) such modification would further the purposes of this Act; or (2) continued adherence to the schedule would be impractical, or not be in the public interest. Stipulates that in the case of a request of a modification by an agency of a project, no modification may be made unless the agency has exercised diligence in attempting to comply with the Schedule. Permits the Board to extend the time for: (1) providing notice of receipt of an application; (2) receiving comments; (3) determining whether to designate a project as a Priority Energy Project; (4)transmittal of agency information; and (5) publication of a Project Decision Schedule. States that nothing in this Act shall: (1) exempt any Priority Energy Project from any applicable Federal, State, or local law; or (2) except as otherwise provided, affect the authority or independence of any independent Federal regulatory agency. Directs the Board to monitor compliance with the Schedule. Directs the Board to determine the reason for any delay and notify the appropriate agencies and Project. Permits the Board to terminate the designation of any project as a Priority Energy Project if: (1) the Project is not complying with the Project Decision Schedule; (2) the Project has not attempted in good faith to comply with any applicable law governing the Project's actions with respect to agency decisions; (3) the designation is no longer necessary; or (4) the Project has requested that the designation be terminated. Provides that a determination by the Board to designate or terminate a project as a Priority Energy Project and the establishment or termination of any Project Decision Schedule shall not be treated as a major Federal action significantly affecting the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to determine whether any Federal action relating to a Priority Energy Project, after it has been so designed and prior to establishing the Project Decision Schedule, will be a \"major Federal action\" for purposes of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Requires the Council to designate a lead agency to assure compliance with NEPA whenever a major Federal action is involved. Permits any Federal agency which is or may be subject to a Project Decision Schedule to change procedures applicable to the agency's actions and decisions with respect to energy projects. Stipulates that the changed procedures shall apply to Priority Energy Projects. Permits affected agencies to consolidate proceedings related to actions and decisions subject to the Project Decision Schedule to the extent practicable. Authorizes the Board to require Federal agencies which are likely to be subject to a Project Schedule to change procedures with respect to any Priority Energy Project. Permits the Board to require affected agencies to consolidate proceedings relating to the Schedule. Permits the Board to make recommendations for changes in procedures applicable to decisions and actions of non-Federal agencies which are or may be subject to a Project Decision Schedule for any Priority Energy Project. Prohibits the Board from requiring that non-Federal agencies adopt such recommendations. Permits non-Federal agencies to consolidate proceedings relating to the Schedule. Authorizes the Board, if any Federal or non-Federal agency has failed, or is likely to fail, to comply with any deadline on the Schedule to bring an action in the appropriate district court to enforce the deadline.
