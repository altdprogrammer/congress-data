    "text": "Small Business Innovation Act of 1980 - Declares that it is in the national interest to strengthen the innovative abilities of small businesses, and to enhance their role in Federal research and development contracts. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) advise and assist Federal agencies in meeting small business research development percentages (as set forth under this Act); (2) utilize the SBA's procurement automated source system to ensure such contract and innovation research opportunities; (3) coordinate the release schedule of small business innovation research (SBIR) solicitations; (4) monitor such programs; and (5) report annually to the Senate Select and the House Small Business Committees. Directs each Federal agency to award to small businesses in fiscal years 1982 and 1983 specified dollar amounts in research and research and development contracts and subcontracts. Directs each Federal agency with an annual research and research and development budget in excess of $100,000,000 to establish an SBIR program beginning in fiscal year 1982. States that such program shall not be less than one percent of the agency's annual research and research and development budget. Sets forth administrative procedures for resolving an agency's noncompliance with small business research and development contract requirements because of interference with national security or the agency's mission. Provides that a Federal agency required to establish an SBIR program shall: (1) determine project categories for such program; (2) issue solicitations in accordance with a schedule determined in cooperation with the SBA; (3) evaluate, select, and administer SBIR proposals and contracts; (4) make progress payments to contractors; and (5) make quarterly reports to the Office of Procurement Assistance and Office of Advocacy of the SBA and the appropriate Congressional committees. Requires a Federal agency with an SBIR program or small business research and development contracts to report quarterly to the Office of Procurement Assistance and Office of Advocacy of the SBA, and to the appropriate Congressional committees, respecting: (1) the number and dollar amount of research contracts over $10,000 awarded to small businesses; and (2) SBIR contracts. Defines \"contract,\" \"small business innovation solicitation program (SBIR),\" and \"research and research and development\" for purposes of this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, in cooperation with the Office of Procurement Assistance and Office of Advocacy of the SBA, to issue guidelines for the SBIR program and for research and development contracts within 120 days of enactment of this Act."
