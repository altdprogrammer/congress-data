Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to: (1) approve or disapprove such a protocol and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report explaining the basis of such action; and (2) monitor the conduct of such a study and submit to the committees a report on such monitoring. Directs the Secretary to submit within two years of the approval of the protocol (and annually thereafter) to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the results of such study and recommendations. Requires the President to assure that such study is fully coordinated with other studies pertaining to the health effects of dioxins."
