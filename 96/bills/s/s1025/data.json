    "text": "Youth Opportunity Wage Act of 1979 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to allow employers to employ youths between 16 and 20 years of age, without prior or special certification by the Secretary of Labor, at 75 percent of the minimum wage (or the applicable wage in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) for 180 days, with the exception of youths who have been employed by the same employer for at least six months or who are currently employed by an employer at the minimum wage. Allows employers to employ any certified full-time student, regardless of age but in compliance with applicable child labor laws at 75 percent of the minimum wage (or 85 percent of the applicable rate in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands), on a part-time basis and for not more than 20 hours per workweek, except during vacations. Authorizes the Secretary to insure against violations of such provisions, but without prior certification requirements. Prohibits employers from engaging in a pattern and practice of: (1) substituting younger workers employed at less than the minimum wage for older workers employed at or above the minimum wage; or (2) terminating the employment of some youth and employing other youth in order to gain continual advantage from the youth opportunity wage. Establishes rates of compensation and fines for such violations."
