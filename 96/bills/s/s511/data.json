    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that compensation paid to an employee of a tax-exempt organization which is deferred under a compensation plan maintained by such an organization shall be includible in the gross income of the participant or beneficiary of such a plan only in the year in which the compensation is paid to the participant or beneficiary. Permits the deferral of the lesser of $7,500 or one-third of such employee's compensation in any taxable year. Permits the deferral of up to $15,000 (\"catch-up exclusion\") of compensations for any employee who did not utilize the $7,500 or one-third deferral limitation in the previous taxable years, if such employee is within three years of normal retirement age. States that the provisions of this Act shall apply to tax-exempt organizations in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1979."
