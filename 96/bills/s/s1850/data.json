    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 96-783) Authorizes the Leo N. Levi Memorial Hospital Association to assign or convey certain lands in the city of Hot Springs, Arkansas, to a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Arkansas for the purpose of erecting and maintaining a housing facility for the elderly. Provides that the execution of such conveyance shall not constitute a forfeiture of any rights granted to the Association under applicable law. Specifies that if such conveyed property is used for purposes other than a facility for the elderly, all rights, privileges, and powers in such property shall be forfeited to the United States. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to make available from the Fund, for purposes of acquiring land and waters for national recreation areas, an amount of money which may exceed by ten percent any statutory ceiling established prior to the convening of the Ninety-sixth Congress. Permits the Secretary of the Interior to make minor changes to boundaries of areas of the national park system if such boundaries were established after January 1, 1965. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire by donation or purchase a suitable collection of whaling artifacts and associated items for preservation and display at the National Maritime Museum located at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Authorizes the appropriation of $3,000,000 for such purchase from amounts previously authorized for development purposes at such recreation area."
