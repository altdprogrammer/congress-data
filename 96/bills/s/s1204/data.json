    "date": "1979-07-30", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Finance with amendment, S. Rept. 96-274) =Title I: Medicaid Programs in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands= - Amends Titles XI, part A (General Provisions), and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to increase the fiscal year ceiling on Federal funding for Medicaid programs beginning in fiscal year 1980 for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. Establishes a payment ceiling of $500,000 for the Northern Mariana Islands. Deletes the existing limit on the Federal medical assistance percentage rate applicable to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam and extends Medicaid coverage to the Northern Mariana Islands. Stipulates that after September 30, 1979, the Federal matching rate for the jurisdictions shall be determined in the same manner as it is determined for the 50 States and the District of Columbia. =Title II: Child Health Assessment Act= - Child Health Assessment Act of 1979 - Amends Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require State plans for the administration of such Title to include early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment programs for any child who is age six or under and to any individual over the age of six and under the age of 21 who is a member of a family eligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and for adopted children with special needs. Defines adopted child with special needs as an individual who: (1) is either six years old or under or between the ages of 6 and 21; (2) has been placed for adoption; (3) was living in foster care before placement for adoption; and (4) on the date of placement for adoption suffered from a condition requiring continuing medical care and services which was a contributing factor to the difficulty of placing such individual for adoption. Establishes a Child Health Assessment Program under Medicaid. Requires State Medicaid plans to include child health assessments and primary care to specified individuals under the age of 21. Requires the State agency responsible for the administration of the Medicaid plan to: (1) provide to specified individuals timely and appropriate child health assessments; (2) provide basic diagnostic and treatment services; (3) provide routine dental care; (4) refer eligible individuals to appropriate providers for corrective treatment which is not available directly from the provider who has the agreement with the State; (5) be reasonably accessible on an ongoing basis; and (6) make required reports to the State agency and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Allows an individual who has received a child health assessment to remain eligible for all care and services provided under the State plan for four months after such individual's family has become ineligible for Medicaid or Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Increases the Federal matching rate for the costs of health assessments and all services (other than dental or inpatient care) provided to children who have been assessed and reassessed at appropriate intervals, and sets forth the formula for the computation of such matching rate. Requires that the States develop a plan for the implementation of a child health assurance program which will meet the applicable level of acceptable performance. Stipulates that the Secretary establish performance standards for child health assurance programs and evaluate the performance of such programs at least biannually. Allows the Secretary to: (1) establish standards for acceptable and superior performance for child health assurance programs; and (2) base increases and decreases of a State's Medicaid funds on the success of each State in achieving these standards. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress annually on the actual levels of performance of each State's child health assurance program in relation to the applicable performance standards. Repeals the previous provision of the Social Security Act relating to appropriations for Child Health Care Assessment Programs. Directs the Secretary to evaluate and submit to Congress a report on the coordination and integration of health care services to children under Title V (Maternal and Child Health) and Title XIX (Medicaid). Permits Federal matching payments for care and services for any individual under 21 years of age who is an inmate of a public institution for juveniles if the individual was eligible for medical assistance under the State's plan before he entered the institution."
