    "text": "Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to authorize the use of appropriated funds for living quarters for the staffs of U.S. representatives to the United Nations. Directs the President to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a U.S. representative to the Vienna office of the United Nations. Authorizes the use of funds appropriated to the State Department for International Organizations and Conferences for ceremonial gifts to international organizations. Authorizes necessary appropriations for the U.S. share of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping forces (presently limited to those in the Middle East). Amends the passport provisions to provide for the Secretary of State to prescribe a fee for issued passports which shall be paid into the U.S. Treasury (presently such fees are set at ten dollars for each passport and are paid quarterly). Extends the period of validity of a passport from five years to ten years. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1946 to authorize the Secretary to pay the travel and relocation expenses of Foreign Service officers and employees assigned to State or local governments within the United States if such officer or employee agrees to remain in such assignment for at least one year."
