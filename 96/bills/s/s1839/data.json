    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate", 
    "date": "1980-06-24", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 5192 passed in lieu) Education Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to replace all references to the Commissioner of Education and to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare with references to the Secretary of Education. Defines \"Department\" as the Department of Education. Specifies that the authorization to enter into contracts or other obligations under such Act shall be effective for fiscal year 1981 and any succeeding fiscal year only to the extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. =Title I: Establishment of a New Title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965= - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a new title I: \"Continuing Postsecondary Education Program and Planning\". Establishes a Commission on National Development in Postsecondary Education to review the effectiveness of policies to promote specified Federal responsibilities in the area of postsecondary education (including use of Federal student assistance to recruit and retain members of the Armed Forces) and to submit a final report to the President and the Congress by January 1, 1983. Terminates the Commission 60 days after submission of the final report. Authorizes appropriations for the period from October 1, 1981, through March 1, 1983, to carry out Commission activities. Directs the Secretary to make State allotments of funds for State planning and continuing education programs, according to specified formulas. Requires States to use portions of such funds for comprehensive statewide planning, information services, and continuing education. Authorizes the Secretary to make discretionary grants to and contracts with public and private entities from a specified portion of such funds. Directs the President to appoint a National Advisory Council on Continuing Education to examine all federally supported continuing education and training programs, to make recommendations to eliminate duplication and effectuate coordination of such programs, and to report annually to the President, the Congress, and the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the remaining barriers to adult postsecondary education, analyzing characteristics of current or potential adult postsecondary students (individuals 22-years of age or older) and the Federal response, and the ability of educational institutions to respond, to the needs of the growing postsecondary student population. Directs the Secretary to include specified considerations in such analysis and to coordinate such study with the activities of the Commission on National Development in Postsecondary Education and with other studies on student financial assistance authorized under such Act. Repeals specified Education Information programs (under title IV, part A, of such Act) of grants to States to pay the Federal share of the cost of planning, establishing, and operating Education Information Centers. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1985 to carry out State planning and continuing education programs. Requires that the non-Federal share cover at least one-third of the cost of such programs. Directs the Secretary to make grants to and contracts with States and educational institutions for institutional planning and adaptation pilot programs. Sets forth: (1) permissible uses of financial assistance for such programs; (2) application requirements; (3) planning and technical assistance functions; and (4) reports and evaluation requirements.

Sets forth provisions, with regard to such programs, for: (1) applications; (2) uses of funds; and (3) grants for national organizations to coordinate, evaluate, and provide technical assistance. Limits financial assistance for such programs to $75,000 per year per eligible recipient (except national organizations). Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1985 for such programs. Directs the Secretary to set aside a minimum specified portion of such funds for national coordination and evaluation. Directs the Secretary to make grants to and contracts with institutions of higher education for postsecondary education and youth unemployment transition three-year demonstration programs, giving special consideration to educational institutions that primarily serve communities experiencing high youth unemployment and low per capita income. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 for such grants. Sets forth activities required of educational institutions in carrying out such programs. Requires each educational institution desiring such a grant to establish a community education work foundation following specified guidelines. Sets forth provisions, with regard to such programs, for: (1) limitations on grants; (2) review panels; (3) periodic review by the Intergovernmental Advisory Council on Education; (4) uses of funds; (5) regulations issued by the Secretary; and (6) evaluation by the National Institute of Education (using two percent of the funds appropriated for such grants). =Title II: College Library Assistance and Library Training and Research= - Extends the authorizations of appropriations for the existing programs of grants for college library resources, library training and research, and strengthening research library resources. Establishes a new program to assess the feasibility and advisability of, and, if feasible and advisable, prepare a design for, a national periodical system to preserve and provide access to a comprehensive collection of periodical literature for public and private libraries throughout the United States. Establishes a nonprofit National Periodical System Corporation. Sets forth provisions for: (1) the functions of the Corporation (including guidelines for the design of such system); (2) a Board of Directors; (3) a Director and staff of the Corporation; (4) its nonprofit nature; (5) its authority; (6) approval by Congress of such design before implementation; and (7) no effect on U.S. copyright law. Authorizes appropriations for such new program for fiscal years 1980 through 1982 and for additional sums to implement an approved design for any fiscal year through 1985. =Title III: Establishment of a New Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965= - Establishes a new title III: \"Institutional Aid\". Directs the Secretary of Education to carry out a program of short-term Federal assistance to strengthen the planning, management, and fiscal capabilities of institutions with special needs. Sets forth required and optional criteria for determining eligibility for such assistance. Authorizes the Secretary to waive certain requirements for eligible institutions: (1) in order to increase higher education opportunities for American Indians, Spanish-speaking people, low-income individuals, or individuals in rural areas unserved by other postsecondary educational institutions; or (2) if an institution has traditionally served substantial numbers of black students. Sets forth provisions, with regard to such program, for: (1) the purpose and duration of a grant; (2) cooperative arrangements; (3) applications for assistance; (4) Federal share; (5) limitations; and (6) challenge grants. (Provides for a waiver of specified requirements for such challenge grants in the case of any institution with special needs that makes a substantial contribution to medical education opportunities for minorities and the economically disadvantaged). Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to provide grants to institutions of higher education with substantial percentages of students from low-income families. Requires that at least 30 percent of sums available for such grants for each fiscal year be available only for eligible junior or community colleges, with the remainder available to eligible institutions planning to award a bachelor's degree during such year. Sets forth provisions for: (1) criteria for eligibility; (2) amounts of grants; (3) uses of funds; and (4) applications. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out title III institutional aid programs for fiscal years 1981 through 1985. Requires that, of such sums appropriated in each fiscal year, there be available 50 percent for aid to institutions with special needs and 50 percent for assistance to institutions enrolling substantial percentages of disadvantaged students. Directs the Secretary to assure that such institutions will not receive an amount less than the amount they received in fiscal year 1979. Directs the Secretary to reserve a specified portion of funds for challenge grants to institutions with special needs. =Title IV: Student Assistance= - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of such Act to redefine student eligibility for grants, loans, and work assistance under such title to include: (1) attendance at an eligible institution; (2) carrying at least one-half the normal full-time workload; (3) maintaining satisfactory progress in the course of study, according to specified guidelines; (4) not owing a refund on previous grants or being in default on a student loan; and (5) filing a statement that such funds will be used solely for educational purposes. Requires a demonstration of financial need, as determined by a need analysis, for specified forms of financial assistance under such title, including basic educational opportunity grants and supplemental educational opportunity grants. Redefines institutional eligibility for purposes of title IV programs (except grants to States for State student incentives) to include: (1) a program participation agreement with the Secretary of Education; (2) continued spending of funds from other sources in its scholarship and student aid program (in the case of participant institutions in the supplemental educational opportunity grant program and work-study programs); (3) proper and efficient administration of funds; (4) compliance with specified provisions and regulations relating to fiscal eligibility; (5) reporting to the Secretary and to holders of loans to students under certain programs; and (6) providing institutional and financial assistance information for students. Extends the basic educational opportunity grants program through fiscal year 1985. Declares that such basic grants shall be known as \"Pell Grants\". Sets the maximum amount of each such grant for academic years 1981-1982 through 1985-1986. Establishes a schedule of reductions, in case of insufficient funds, providing for uniformly increasing percentage reduction as the entitlement decreases. Sets forth recommended, non-mandatory funding levels to be provided for the supplemental education opportunity grants program, the college work study program, and the national direct student loan program before increases in funding should be provided for the basic educational opportunity grant program. Extends the supplemental educational opportunity grants program through fiscal year 1985. Requires that sums appropriated for such program be available for payments to institutions until the end of the second fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which they were appropriated. Raises the limit on the amount of each such grant to $2,000 per academic year. Allows the $200 minimum payment requirement to be reduced proportionately for students enrolled for less than a full academic year. Eliminates a requirement relating to the prescription of criteria and schedules for the guidance of institutions in determining student need for supplemental educational opportunity grants. (Prescribes such criteria for need analysis for various forms of assistance, including supplemental educational opportunity grants, under title IV and directs the Secretary of Education to publish such schedules, later in the bill). Limits the period during which a student may receive supplemental grants to the period required for the completion of the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study being pursued by that student at the institution which the student attends. Requires that students meet specified eligibility and application requirements for such grants. Requires institutions to select individuals, from those eligible for such supplemental grants, for the award of such grants and to determine the amounts to be paid them, according to specified criteria. Prohibits an eligible institution from using more than ten percent of its allocation for less-than-half-time undergraduate students eligible for and in need of such grants. Sets forth a formula for allocations to eligible institutions by the Secretary from grant funds apportioned to States. Permits each institution to use such allocations for initial and continuing supplemental grants in a manner which it determines will best achieve the purposes of the supplemental grant program. Extends the program of grants to States for State student incentives through fiscal year 1985. Sets forth a formula for the allotment of such grant funds to States. Raises the limit on the amount of such incentive grants to $2,000 per academic year. Waives the requirement that all nonprofit institutions of higher education in a State be eligible to participate in the State incentive grant program, in the case of any State in which such participation violates a statute enacted prior to October 1, 1978. Requires that States incentive grant programs: (1) permit eligible institutions, with State agency approval, to use their payments in a manner they determine will best achieve program purposes; and (2) permit eligible institutions, with the express approval of a State agency to use any portion of payments for grants to less-than-half-time students. Extends special programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds through fiscal year 1985. Directs the Secretary, in making grants and contracts for such special programs, to consider the prior experience of service delivery under the particular program for which funds are sought by each applicant. Adds the training of persons serving or preparing for service in such special programs as one purpose for which such grants and contracts may be designed. Sets forth eligibility requirements for such special programs, including Talent Search, Upward Bound, Special Services for Disadvantaged Students, and Educational Opportunity Centers. Requires that specified percentages of those participating in such programs be low-income individuals and/or first-generation college students. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide training for staff and leadership personnel in such programs. Eliminates the title IV program of Education Information. Establishes a new program entitled \"Special Programs for Students Whose Families are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farmwork\". Directs the Secretary to maintain and expand existing secondary and postsecondary high school equivalency program and college assistance migrant program projects designed to provide services for students of families engaged in migrant and seasonal farmwork. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal years 1981 through 1985. Repeals the program of Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education involving cost-of-education payments to each institution of higher education. Extends the program of veterans' cost-of-instruction payments to institutions of higher education through fiscal year 1985 for some institutions and through any academic year ending before the end of fiscal year 1986 for other institutions. Requires institutions applying for such payments to set forth plans to insure an adequate effort to carry out programs coordinated with those of a specified veterans' readjustment counseling program and with the veterans' employment and training initiatives authorized under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act and other specified legislation. Eliminates the less-than-2,500-students-in-attendance size requirement for institutions which may, upon determination of a necessity by the Secretary, carry out such veterans' programs through a consortium agreement with other institutions. Lowers to $75,000 (formerly $135,000) the maximum amount of such veterans' program payments to any one school and its branches in any fiscal year. Raises the percentage (from 75 to 90) of such amount received which must be spent to maintain a full-time office of veterans' affairs at the institution. Requires that the veterans' cost-of-instruction payments program be administered by an identifiable administrative unit in the Department of Education. Extends the Federal loan insurance program through fiscal year 1986 for new student loans and through fiscal year 1990 for loans to enable students with prior insured loans to continue or complete their education program. Sets a $3,000 limit on the total amount of loans made to an independent undergraduate student in any academic year which may be covered by Federal loan insurance. Sets a limitation on aggregate unpaid principal amounts for all such loans of $15,000 for independent undergraduate students. (Retains the $7,500 limit for non-independent undergraduates). Raises such limit for graduate or professional students to $25,000 (from $15,000). Makes similar changes in limitations on State and non-profit institution loan insurance programs which receive Federal payments to reduce student interest costs or which are reimbursed under Federal loan insurance supplemental guaranty agreements. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the limits applicable to graduate and professional students pursuing exceptionally expensive programs. Includes among those permitted to defer repayment of principal on Federally-insured student loans, officers in the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, full-time volunteers with specified tax-exempt organizations, interns, and those totally disabled or unable to secure employment because of the care required by a temporarily disabled spouse. Permits similar deferments under specified student loan programs insured by States or nonprofit institutions. Authorizes each State agency and nonprofit private institution or organization with which the Secretary has a specified agreement, or an eligible lender in such State, to make loans directly to students otherwise unable to obtain federally guaranteed and insured loans. Permits such entities to receive payments, from sums paid by the Student Loan Marketing Association, for each fiscal year to meet the demand for such loans. Limits the amount of such payments to 25 percent of the average of the loans guaranteed by a given entity for three years preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made (or, if such entity does not have three years previous experience, 25 percent of the loans guaranteed under a program of a State of comparable size). Requires that such loans have the same terms, conditions, and benefits as all other guaranteed and insured student loans. Raises from seven percent to nine percent the maximum rate of interest per year on the unpaid principal balance of a loan which the Secretary may prescribe and define for federally insured student loans. Reduces to four months (formerly, nine-to-12 months) the period after a student ceases to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload and during which: (1) the student may specifically request loan repayment over less than a five year period; and (2) the student may not be required to begin repayment. Makes similar changes in maximum interest rates and repayment periods for loans under the program of Federal payments to reduce student interest cost. Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with credit bureau organizations to provide for the exchange of information concerning student borrowers. Requires that such agreements provide that: (1) the Secretary disclose only accurate and complete information and not disclose that a loan is in default until a reasonable effort has been made to collect the debt; (2) such organizations will be promptly notified, and will promptly record changes submitted by the Secretary or objections by the borrower with respect to such information; (3) no unfair, unreasonable, harassing, or misleading collection practices will result; and (4) the Secretary will notify the borrower (except in the case of disclosures made to obtain the borrower's location) that such information will only be disclosed after a reasonable period (at least 30 days from the date such notice has been sent) has passed in which such borrower has failed to enter into repayment. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) such disclosure of information as a routine use; and (2) a system for the prompt notification of any borrower of any such disclosure. Declares that such information disclosed by the Secretary to credit bureau organizations shall not constitute a system of records under specified provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and that credit bureau organizations entering into such agreements with the Secretary shall not be considered Government contractors within the meaning of such Act. Requires that written agreements evidencing federally-insured student loans contain notice of such system of disclosure and provide that the lender, on request of the borrower, will inform such credit bureaus of the repayment status of the note. Authorizes the Secretary to provide eligible lenders, and State or nonprofit corporations having specified guaranty agreements, with any relevant information from whatever source with respect to borrowers. Provides, for purposes of State or nonprofit private institutional student loan insurance program agreements with the Secretary for Federal payments to reduce interest costs, that insurance premiums in such programs: (1) be limited to one percent per year on the unpaid principal amount of the loan; and (2) may be used to insure loans and to cover administrative, operating and overhead costs of the insurer. Includes the administrative costs of monitoring the enrollment and repayment status of students among those items: (1) which such State or nonprofit entities may deduct before determining the Secretary's equitable share of payments made by the borrower; and (2) for which the Secretary is authorized to make payments to such entities. Redefines the administrative costs of promotion of commercial lender participation, for purposes of provisions relating to such agreements, to include the costs of providing interest and special allowance computation and billing services to lenders and the amount of non-Federal funds expended by an insurer as incentive payments to lenders to induce them to improve or expand their program participation. Permits State agencies or nonprofit or private entities, with such agreements with the Secretary, to enter into agreements with eligible lenders (other than an eligible institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State) to authorize multiple disbursements of the proceeds of a loan under which the lender will pay the proceeds of such loans into an escrow account to be administered by the State or nonprofit private entity according to specified provisions. Requires that eligible lenders enter into agreements with the Secretary under which they will provide thorough and accurate loan counseling, with specified inclusions, on guaranteed or insured loans to the student borrower. Permits parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow, under the same terms as other guaranteed student loans, up to $3,000 per student per academic year and up to $15,000 as an aggregated insured principal for loans on behalf of any one student. Prohibits such borrowing to pay for the expenses of more than three students in any academic year. Provides for annual insurable limits, deferments of repayment of principal, and interest rates for such loans. Directs the Secretary to insure such loans in a State only if the State will not do so within a specified period. Revises the formulas for computing the amount of specified special allowances and the amount of daily interest on such allowances. Establishes a Committee on Determining Student Loan Special Allowances (which replaces the Committee on the Process of Determining Student Loan Special Allowances) to report to Congress on improved methods, in accord with revised objectives, for the determination of the quarterly rate of special allowances. Prohibits the payment of any such special allowance unless the authority issuing such obligations submits for the approval of the Secretary a plan of doing business. Requires that such plan assure that: (1) no eligible lender in the area served by the authority will be excluded from participation, under the same terms and conditions for all, in such program; (2) no director or staff member of the authority may own stock in, or receive compensation from, any agency that would contract to service and collect the loans of the authority; (3) student loans will not be purchased from participating lenders at a rate less than nor more than one percent of the unpaid principal amount borrowed plus accrued interest to the date of acquisition; (4) the authority will, within the limit of funds available and subject to applicable State and Federal law, make loans to, or purchase loans incurred by, all eligible students attending an eligible institution, or residing, within the area served; (5) the authority has a plan to pursue the development of new lender participation in a continuing program of benefits to students together with assurances of existing lender commitments to the program; and (6) there will be an annual audit of the authority by a certified public accounting firm, including review of compliance with the plan. Revises provisions establishing the Student Loan Marketing Association so that Association is no longer \"Government-sponsored\". Permits the Association's Board of Directors to fix the par value of its common stock from time to time. Terminates the requirement that the Secretary prescribe regulations for the maximum number of shares of such stock which may be issued or be outstanding at any one time. Permits dividends to be declared on nonvoting common stock (as well as on common stock). Authorizes the Association to issue: (1) nonvoting common stock which shall be freely transferable; and (2) nonvoting preferred stock. Sets forth requirements for the types of security which must be made on warehousing advances made by the Association and for the use of proceeds from such advances. Requires that student loans set aside pursuant to the offering of participations or pooled interests be adequate at all times to ensure timely principal and interest payments of such securities. Declares that nothing in the provisions requiring the approval of the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury for the issuance and having of outstanding obligations by the Association shall be construed so as to authorize such Secretaries to limit, control, or constrain programs of the Association or support of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program by the Association. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from conditioning approval of such issuance on such obligations being made or sold to the Federal Financing Bank. Extends by two years (from prior to July 1, 1982, to prior to July 1, 1984) the authority of the Secretary of Education to guarantee payment on such obligations. Requires prompt Government action on Association requests for approvals to issue such obligations. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase such obligations, within specified limits. Authorizes the Association to sell or issue obligations on the security of guaranteed student loans. Authorizes the Association to make new insurable loans to specified borrowers to discharge the liability on old student loans. Directs the Association to make payments to State and nonprofit entities and eligible lenders submitting applications setting forth that such payments are necessary to enable such groups to carry out the making of student loans to otherwise ineligible students provided for under this Act. Authorizes the Association to make insurable student loans whenever the Secretary, after consulting with representatives of a State, determines that a substantial portion of all eligible borrowers in a State or within an area of substantial population in a State are unable to obtain student loans. Stipulates that the Association in making such insurable loans shall not be deemed a creditor for purposes of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Provides for student loan consolidation by State and nonprofit private entities having agreements with the Secretary (in which case they will not be deemed creditors for Consumer Credit Protection Act purposes) and by eligible lenders or their designated agents, upon the request of a borrower whose aggregate outstanding indebtedness exceeds $5,000 from two or more programs or lenders under title IV of such Act, or exceeds $7,500 from a single lender under the guaranteed and insured loans programs. Directs the Secretary to make determinations regarding the due diligence by an insurance beneficiary in the collection of a student loan within 90 days after notification of default and to make payment in full on the amount of the beneficiary's loss pending completion of the due diligence investigation. Provides for a grace period of four months after the completion of specified periods, or combinations, of study, training, service, or unemployment before repayment of principal on a federally insured or guaranteed student loan must begin. Provides for the recapture of certain interest subsidies on student loans by requiring borrowers to repay such interest subsidies to the Federal Government in installments during the normal loan repayment period.
