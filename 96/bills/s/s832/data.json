    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended (inserted text of H. R. 4970)) Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to authorize appropriations for the Federal Election Commission for fiscal year 1980. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for audits of House or Senate candidates and their campaign committees, unless such audits are based on a finding by the Commission of reason to believe that such candidates or their committees have violated provisions of such Act. Limits the amount of expenditures to be used, directly or indirectly, for the operation or support of the clearinghouse functions provided under such Act. Prohibits any multicandidate political committee (other than a multicandidate committee of a political party) from making contributions to a candidate for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress and his or her authorized committees exceeding: (1) $6,000 with respect to a general or special election and a primary election relating to such election; (2) $6,000 with respect to a primary and runoff election relating to a general or special election; (3) $9,000 with respect to a general or special election and both a primary and runoff election relating to such election; and (4) $5,000 for any single election. Prohibits a candidate for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress or any authorized political committee from accepting contributions from political committees, other than committees of a political party, aggregating more than: (1) $70,000 with respect to a general or special election and a primary election relating to such election; (2) $70,000 with respect to a primary and runoff election relating to a general or special election; and (3) $85,000 with respect to a general or special election and both a primary and runoff election relating to such election. Specifies that any contribution made after the date of a general or special election shall be considered a contribution to such election only if the candidate at the time of receipt has insufficient funds to pay election expenses. Requires a political committee to report as a contribution to a candidate any contribution made by an individual which appears to be made by or on behalf of the committee. Includes within the definition of \"contribution\" for purposes of such Act any extension of credit to a candidate or political committee: (1) by a person (other than a broadcasting station, newspaper, or magazine) providing goods or services relating to political advertising when such extension exceeds the normal time allowed by such person or 60 days from the date such goods or services are provided; or (2) in connection with the mailing of materials which solicit funds to influence an election. Prohibits a congressional candidate from using more than $35,000 in campaign contributions as reimbursement for the personal funds the candidate expended in connection with his or her election."
