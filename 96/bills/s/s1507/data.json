    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) purchase from the Escondido Mutual Water Company and the Vista Irrigation District certain facilities, lands, rights of way, interests in land, and water rights in and around the San Luis Rey River and Lake Henshaw, San Diego County, California, to be held in trust by the United States for the sole use and benefit of the La Jolla, Rincon, San Pasqual, Pauma, and Pala Bands of Mission Indians; and (2) to contract with an entity established by such Bands to provide for the operation and maintenance of such facilities and other interests. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer title to specified Government land underlying or adjacent to Lake Wohlford to the city of Escondido, California for as long as such land is devoted to recreational purposes. Directs the Secretary, in consultation and cooperation with such Bands, to: (1) adopt plans for irrigation systems for the Reservations of such Bands and construct such systems within five years; (2) devise and adopt an operating plan for the impoundment, release, diversion, and utilization of the waters and ground waters of the San Luis Rey River (with provisions for the sale and delivery to other entities of waters in excess of the needs of such Bands and for the use of such proceeds for facilities and maintenance irrigation systems construction); and (3) to adopt, in consultation with the California Division of Safety of Dams, plans for the rehabilitation of Henshaw Dam and water gathering facilities above such dam and to undertake construction to implement such plans. Directs the Attorney General of the United States to enter into and approve settlements for all damage claims in a specified Court of Claims case. Requires that such Bands: (1) upon payment of such settlements, waive all claims for damages and annual charges arising from the impoundment and diversion of the waters of the San Luis Rey River and the use of Indian lands for that purpose; and (2) upon purchases of aforementioned facilities, lands, rights of way, interests in land, and water rights, agree to dismissal of specified cases in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into contracts, subject to the approval of the affected band, with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California or the San Diego County Water Authority or their member agencies to provide for the delivery of such district water to such Reservations and the sale or exchange of such River waters for Colorado River and northern California waters; and (2) construct facilities to deliver such imported water to the Reservations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) appoint a Commission to submit recommendations for a comprehensive plan for use of Lake Henshaw and specified lands above such lake for open space, watershed, agriculture, recreation, and tourism; (2) to adopt, submit to Congress, and implement such plan; and (3) to preserve existing conditions in such lands until such plan is adopted and implemented. Prohibits uses of the lands above such lake that will substantially impair the quality or quantity of water for such Reservations unless the approval of the affected band is first obtained. Directs the Secretary to give preference to such bands and their members in leasing or conveying lands for commercial ventures included in such land use plan. Declares that this Act: (1) resolves all issues in a specified proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and (2) serves as specified legislation contemplated under the Federal Power Act. Directs the Commission to dismiss such proceedings."
