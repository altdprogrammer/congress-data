States that such teams shall provide for existing residential and small commercial buildings diagnostic and retrofit services which include: (1) the determination of heat flow paths in and out of the building; (2) the use of insulating techniques to seal such paths where practicable; (3) adjustments to heating or cooling units to optimize energy efficiency; and (4) recommendations for fuel cost savings. Directs the Secretary of Energy to prescribe grant application guidelines for States. Specifies restrictions on approval of grant applications. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress annual reports on: (1) the number of residential and commercial buildings receiving the diagnostic and retrofit services each year under this Act; and (2) the energy saved in each State each year as a result of such program."
