    "text": "New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980 - Designates the following National Forest System lands in the State of New Mexico as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Aldo Leopold Wilderness in the Gila National Forest; (2) the Blue Range Wilderness in the Apache-Sitgreaves and Gila National Forest; (3) the Capitan Mountain Wilderness in the Lincoln National Forest; (4) the Dome Wilderness in the Santa Fe National Forest; (5) the Latir Peak Wilderness in the Carson National Forest; and (6) the Withington Wilderness in the Cibola National Forest. Designates certain additions to: (1) the Gila Wilderness in the Gila National Forest; (2) the Guadalupe Escarpment Wilderness and the White Mountain Wilderness in the Lincoln National Forest; (3) the Pecos Wilderness in the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests; and (4) the Wheeler Peak Wilderness in the Carson National Forest. Designates specified lands in the Apache-Sitgreaves and the Gila National Forest as further study area. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to study such lands for the single purpose of classifying their suitability or nonsuitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Requires such study to be concluded no later than January 1, 1983. Declares that Congress does not intend to designate any of the lands within the National Forest System in New Mexico which have been studied as a part of the Secretary of Agriculture's roadless area review and evaluation program (RARE II) and which are not designated for further planning or as wilderness by this Act for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Declares that such lands shall continue to be available for uses other than wilderness under the existing Forest Service plans applicable to the national forest within which such lands are located. Declares that further recommendation of lands within the National Forest System in New Mexico for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System may be made only ten years after the enactment of this Act and only every tenth year thereafter."
