    "text": "Economic Growth Management Assistance Act - Establishes within the Executive Office of the President: (1) an Economic Growth Policy and Management Assistance Council (Council) which shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and (2) an Office of Economic Growth Policy and Management Assistance to provide staff support for the Council and carry out other duties as assigned by the Council. Sets forth the duties of the Council which include: (1) evaluating the economic impact of Federal activities such as spending, contracting, and facility relocation on local, State, and regional economies; (2) identifying those economies which are substantially affected by such activities; (3) developing, updating, and submitting to Congress an annual national economic growth policy designed to stabilize economic growth; (4) developing programs to facilitate stable growth; (5) assisting substantially affected economies; and (6) reviewing proposed agency activities which will have a substantial impact on any such economies. Requires each Federal agency: (1) to prepare an annual economic impact statement on the effects of its activities on such economies; (2) to make such statement available to Congress and the public; and (3) to change their activities as necessary to avoid intensifying any negative economic trends of subtantially affected communities. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make employment training programs available to persons in such substantially affected areas. Directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Defense to make technical and economic adjustment assistance available to such areas."
