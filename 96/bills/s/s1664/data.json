Limits the amount of such credit to $250 for a taxable year. Reduces the amount of such credit by five percent of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer exceeds $20,000, and by the amount of any State or Federal grant money received by the taxpayer for the purchase of home heating oil. Qualifies tenants for a certain amount of such credit based upon amount of rent paid."
