Makes special rules for taxpayers who are: (1) engaged in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors; or (2) forced to leave a foreign country because of war or civil unrest precluding the normal conduct of business. Repeals the existing deduction for certain expenses of living abroad."
