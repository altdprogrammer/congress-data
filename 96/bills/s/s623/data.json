Entitles candidates for the United States Senate meeting certain criteria and agreeing to comply with specified spending limits and reporting requirements to campaign payments on a matching basis. Requires such candidates to certify that: (1) their authorized committees will not make campaign expenditures in excess of certain limitations; (2) no contributions will be accepted by such candidates or their authorized committees in violation of this Act; (3) such candidates are seeking election to the United States Senate and have received contributions for that campaign in excess of a certain sum; and (4) at least two candidates have qualified for election to the same seat. Sets forth formulas for the determination of the amount of money to which a candidate is entitled. Stipulates that sums given by one contributor totalling over $100 shall be disregarded for purposes of matching payments. Sets spending limits for candidates receiving payments under this Act. Waives such limits for candidates whose opponents are not receiving matching payments and have spent sums in excess of the limit imposed for candidates receiving payments. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a separate Senate General Election Campaign Account in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and to deposit certain sums in such account in accordance with specified guidelines. Requires repayment of excess payments and unexpended payments. Penalizes the use of funds for other than campaign purposes. Authorizes the Federal Election Commission to institute repayment actions in U.S. district courts. Specifies the administrative authority of the Commission in carrying out this Act."
