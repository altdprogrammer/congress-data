    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Western Area Power Marketing Revolving Fund Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to construct or otherwise acquire transmission facilities in order to: (1) integrate and transmit electric power from existing or additional generating units; (2) provide customer service; (3) provide interregional transmission facilities; and (4) maintain electrical stability and reliability. Limits the Secretary's authority to make such acquisitions. Authorizes the Secretary to become a member of electrical cooperatives and other institutions determined necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes the establishment of the Western Area Power Administration Fund. Requires revenues available for repayment of investments, except as otherwise provided, to continue to be applied first to repayment of the highest interest-bearing investments and to accomplish repayment over the established repayment period. Includes in such Fund: (1) receipts from power marketing activities; (2) moneys borrowed from the U.S. Treasury; (3) congressional appropriations; and (4) unexpended balances of funds appropriated or otherwise made available. Authorizes the Secretary to make expenditures from such Fund as necessary for Western's programs. Limits the use of appropriated and trust funds. Requires the Secretary to keep the official record of Western's operations, receipts, and expenditures. Directs the Secretary to maintain separate accounts for the individual projects of Western for which the Bureau of Reclamation was formerly the power marketing agency provided the Secretary makes specified payments to the Water and Power Resources Service. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) invest moneys in nonmarketable obligations of the United States; and (2) borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury amounts on behalf of Western. Prohibits the Secretary from spending funds made available under this Act, other than specifically appropriated funds, to acquire any operating transmission facility by condemnation. Directs Western to cooperate in transmission system planning with other utilities, to participate in joint construction of transmission facilities, and to provide the opportunity for participation by others in the joint construction and ownership of transmission lines."
