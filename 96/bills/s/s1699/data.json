    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs with amendment (without written report)) Energy Impact Assistance Act of 1980 - Amends the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to authorize State Governors or Indian tribal governing bodies to designate energy impacted areas in accordance with specified conditions concerning increases in employment, population, use of public services and facilities, and lack of financial resources to meet needs for such increased use of services and facilities resulting from the existence of a major energy development in such areas. Directs the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor, the Interior, and Agriculture, to approve any designation of an energy impacted area. Requires State Governors and Indian tribal governing bodies to designate local planning units to prepare mitigation plans for each such energy impact area. Requires a mitigation plan to: (1) identify the projected impact of each major energy development on the economy of such area and the specific needs within such area for public facilities and services resulting from the development; (2) contain assurances that the proceeds from any repayment of loans made by a State or Indian tribe under this Act will be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury; (3) provide for the revision of such plans; and (4) be coordinated with planning assisted or required under the Act or any other appropriate Federal statute. Requires such plans to be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires that States and Indian tribes having energy impacted areas submit to the Secretary of Agriculture a comprehensive investment strategy describing the intended use of energy impact assistance as a condition for receiving such assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make implementation loans and authorizes loan guarantees for the same purposes. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, upon finding that a loan recipient is unable to meet its obligations, to, subject to stated conditions: (1) modify the terms and conditions of a loan; (2) make a supplemental loan, the proceeds of which shall be applied to the payment of principal or interest due on the loan; or (3) forgive all or any portion of the loan upon a finding that otherwise insolvency will ensue or substantial economic hardship will result. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans, loan guarantees, and payments of interest on loans to States and other eligible applicants to address the need for public facilities or services in a designated energy impact area on an expedited basis in the event energy development poses a serious threat to the public health and safety and such needs cannot be met in a sufficiently timely manner by other Federal programs. Sets forth terms and conditions of assistance. Prohibits assistance under this Act from being used to provide the non-Federal portion of costs of any other Federal assistance program. Prohibits the appropriation of funds in support of any program for which Federal financial assistance is available to eligible applicants under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 or the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. Establishes in the United States Treasury an Energy Impact Insurance Fund to be used as a reserve for insured and guaranteed loans. Authorizes the Appalachian Regional Commission established under the Appalachian Regional Commission Act of 1965 or any regional commission established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to apply for and receive planning grants under the Act to assist areas impacted by increased coal or uranium production. Directs the President to establish an interagency council to coordinate all Federal programs providing assistance to meet needs resulting from major energy developments. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to designate an organizational unit to, among other things, administer the program established by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary, in mutual consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to issue regulations necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to withhold financial assistance from a recipient for failure to comply with this Act or regulations issued thereunder. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to report annually to Congress concerning this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 through 1985 to carry out the programs established under this Act. Sets forth criteria for the allocation of such funds as are appropriated. Prohibits specified actions or failures to act from being used as a legal basis for delaying or prohibiting the issuance of any licenses or other authority necessary for the development, construction, or operation of a major energy development. Requires the General Accounting Office to prepare and submit to the Congress a report on the implementation and effectiveness of the program of assistance established under this Act. Sets forth conforming amendments."
