Directs that certain investigations conducted by the Board shall have priority over all other investigations conducted by Federal regulatory agencies. Directs the Board to assure that appropriate information obtained or developed in the course of its investigations is exchanged in a timely manner with other Federal agencies. Declares that such agencies shall not be restricted in obtaining information directly from persons involved in a transportation accident. Specifies that any properly credentialed employee of the Board, in investigating a transportation accident, may take custody of any materials determined to be required for the purpose of the investigation. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of such Act for fiscal years 1981, 1982 and 1983, such sums to remain available until expended."
