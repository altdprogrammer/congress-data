    "text": "Regulatory Negotiation Act of 1980 - Title I: General Provisions - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to encourage the formation of regulatory negotiation commission as an alternative to the adversarial process of establishing regulatory policy. Defines the term \"regulatory negotiation commission\" as a group consisting of representatives of the major positions on the issues under consideration which is formed voluntarily by private individuals and organizations to attempt, through negotiation, to reach consensus recommendations on regulatory policy. Title II: Grants for Regulatory Negotiation Commissions - Directs the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States to establish a pilot program to make grants to five regulatory negotiation commission projects during each of fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Restricts such grants to projects pertaining to regulatory policy in the areas of health, safety, and the environment for which: (1) a major law has been enacted, but no rules or regulations have been issued; (2) final rules and regulations have been issued, but are likely to undergo major revision; or (3) basic statutory changes are expected. Requires the Chairman to select the areas for which grant applications will be accepted and to provide notice to the public of such grants. Specifies the information to be included in such an application including: (1) the need for the commission; (2) a proposed membership list for the commission; and (3) a written commitment by each member to negotiate in good faith and to produce a report on negotiations within the necessary time period. Directs the Chairman to approve an application only if the proposed commission: (1) will be able to report expanded areas of consensus among the affected parties; (2) will include balanced and sufficient representation of the major positions of interest in the area of regulatory policy to be considered; and (3) can recommend policy alternatives that will provide significant improvements over existing policy. Permits such grants to be used to employ an administrative director of a commission, to pay travel and per diem expenses of commission members, and to pay other administrative costs. Requires each commission receiving a grant to issue a final report outling areas of consensus, areas of disagreement, and recommendations. Directs an agency, upon request, to send an observer to a commission to provide information and make suggestions to the commission and to report to the agency concerning commission activities. Prohibits such an observer from negotiating policy on behalf of the agency or officially representing the agency. Requires an agency to comment on the report of a commission within a specified period and to submit such comments to the appropriate congressional committees. Directs all Federal agencies engaged in the areas of health, safety, and environmental regulation to review the reports of any regulatory negotiation commission regardless of whether such commission is funded under this Act. Title III: Miscellaneous - Requires the Chairman to report to Congress by January 1, 1983, on the pilot program established under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
