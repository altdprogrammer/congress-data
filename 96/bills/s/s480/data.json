Repeals specified limitations on the use of such funds. Prohibits the use of such funds to implement the water project review function of the Council. Stipulates that such appropriation shall remain available until expended. =Title II:= - Establishes a program of financial and program assistance to the States and to federally recognized Indian tribes for the development, implementation, and modification of State water management programs and water conservation technical assistance programs. Authorizes the appropriation of: (1) $25,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1980-1982 to assist the States with water management programs; and (2) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 for water conservation technical assistance programs. Limits the Federal share of carrying out such programs to 50 percent of the cost of such programs. Directs the Council to approve any program for water conservation technical assistance if such program is an integral part of an approved water management program."
