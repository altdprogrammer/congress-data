Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to estimate quarterly whether the domestic price of lamb exceeds the parity price and, on the basis of such estimate, to adjust the aggregate quantity of lamb meat which may enter the United States. Requires the Secretary to estimate annually the quota established, the domestic price of lamb, and any adjustment of the quota. Directs the Secretary to allocate such quotas among supplying countries on the basis of their share of the U.S. market."
