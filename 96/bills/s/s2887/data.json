    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Labor Statistics Confidentiality Act - Defines \"protected data\" to mean any data: (1) collected by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employees for use in a statistical program; (2) which could reasonably be uniquely associated with a person's identity; and (3) which was so designated by the Commissioner before the data was obtained. Defines \"cooperative statistical data\" to mean data collected by a State or local agency in accordance with a cooperative statistical program conducted jointly with the Bureau. Restricts the use of protected and cooperative statistical data to employees of the Bureau for the conduct of statistical programs of the Bureau only. Applies the provisions of this Act to data transferred from other Federal agencies to BLS. Allows the use of protected and cooperative statistical data for any purpose specified by the Commissioner in a manner that permits particular data to be associated with particular persons if certain notice requirements are met. Permits waiver of the restrictions of this Act with express written consent of the respondent. Immunizes such data from legal process, except for the purposes of enforcing this Act or when the data is otherwise available under the terms of this Act. Establishes a civil penalty of up to $5,000 and/or debarment from grants and contracts involving Department of Labor statistical programs for up to five years for violations of this Act."
