Limits the amount of such award to $20,000 for any one civil action. Includes within the definition of \"attorneys' fees\" amounts paid to an individual who is not an attorney, but who is authorized to practice before the Tax Court. Defines \"prevailing party\" as a party who recovers all, or all but an insignificant portion of the amount in controversy in a civil tax proceding, or whose position is sustained as to all, or all but an insignificant portion, of the issues involved, and who establishes that the position of the United States in the civil action was unreasonable. Disallows costs and attorneys' fees for certain civil actions involving declaratory judgments. Title II: Amendments to Title 28 - Incorporates into title 28 (Judiciary and Judicial Procedure) of the United States Code the amendments set forth in title I of this Act."
