    "text": "Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit the importation into the United States of certain foreign excess property manufactured in the United States unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the importation of such property will not have an adverse impact on U.S. markets. (Currently such importation is prohibited unless the Secretary, or the Secretary of Agriculture for agricultural products, determines that the importation would relieve a domestic shortage or otherwise benefit the U.S. economy.) Exempts from such determination requirement: (1) foreign excess property imported by a Federal agency; and (2) foreign excess property which a Federal agency certifies will be reexported. Sets forth administrative sanctions for violations of this Act."
