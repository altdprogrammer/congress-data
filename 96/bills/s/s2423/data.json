    "date": "1980-03-14", 
    "text": "International Development and Security Cooperation Act of 1980 - Title I: Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Related Acts - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1981 for: (1) agriculture, rural development, and nutrition; (2) population planning and health programs; (3) education and human resources development; (4) development of indigenous energy resources; (5) Sahel development program; (6) American schools and hospitals abroad; (7) international organizations and programs; (8) international narcotics control; (9) international disaster assistance; (10) economic support fund; (11) peacekeeping operations; (12) military assistance (with specified limitations on amounts for Portugal, Spain, and the Philippines); (13) international military education and training; (14) reimbursable development programs; (15) operating expenses for administering the international development programs; and (16) the Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. Stipulates that prohibitions on assistance to countries shall not be construed to prohibit the continuation of assistance to private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives. Directs the President to take into consideration whether such continued support is in the U.S. national interest. Decreases the amount due and payable during fiscal year 1981 to the United States from relatively least developed countries on development loans. Repeals the Economic Support Fund regional programs. Authorizes the President to furnish military assistance to friendly countries or international organizations by transferring authorized funds for specified recipients to be used to meet obligations of such recipients for payment for arms sales under the Arms Export Control Act. Increases the aggregate value of the drawdown of defense articles from Defense Department stocks, defense services, and military education and training authorized in emergencies. Extends the authority to furnish military assistance until September 30, 1982 or for five years after such assistance is authorized. Decreases the value of additions of defense articles to stockpiles in foreign countries during fiscal year 1981. Revises the list of foreign countries to which the President is authorized to assign members of the U.S. Armed Forces to manage security assistance programs by deleting Iran and Kuwait and adding Egypt. Permits the number of defense attaches performing overseas management functions to exceed by up to six the number of attaches authorized on December 31, 1979. Repeals provisions which: (1) set conditions on funds for Inter-American regional military education and training programs; and (2) require the President to justify international military training to Congress. Allows foreign assistance funds to be used to procure agricultural products outside the United States when the domestic price is less than parity if the commodity can not reasonably be procured in the United States in fulfillment of the objectives of a particular assistance program. Permits the President to make sales, extend credit, or issue guaranties under the Arms Export Control Act, as well as furnish assistance, without regard to statutory limitations if to do so is vital to U.S. security. Permits expenses for orderly termination of programs to include funds to enable students abroad to complete their training. Gives the Auditor General subpoena power. Title II: Amendments to the Arms Export Control Act - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to delete: (1) prohibitions against the use of U.S. military personnel performing defense services sold under such Act to train, advise, or otherwise assist combat activities; and (2) the provision allowing the President to waive certain charges for sales that would advance foreign procurement in the United States under the coproduction arrangements. Authorizes the President to sell or contract to sell design or construction services to eligible countries or international organizations if the United States is paid in full in advance for the costs of furnishing such services. Makes such sales subject to the statutory provisions applicable to defense articles and services. Authorizes appropriations for foreign military sales for fiscal year 1981. Stipulates that credits and loan guarantees may be made only to the extent provided in advance in appropriations acts. Establishes separate ceilings on the total amount of credit and of loan guarantees authorized to be extended for fiscal year 1981. Makes a specified amount available only for the costs of relocating Israeli forces from the Sinai. Exempts Israel from specified credit and loan guarantees restrictions for fiscal year 1981. Releases Israel from a specified amount of its contractual liability to repay the United States. Grants a ten year grace period before Egypt, the Sudan, and Turkey are required to begin repayment of the principal of loans guaranteed to finance credit sales of defense articles and services. Requires the President to submit written certification to Congress concerning the transfer of defense articles and services only if such transfer involves major defense articles or services valued above specified amounts to countries other than Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Exempts letters of offer to sell and applications for licenses to export, defense articles and services to such nations from certification requirements. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes necessary appropriations for fiscal year 1982."
