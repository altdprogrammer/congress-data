Rept. 96-977) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey to Carnegie-Mellon University the land owned by the United States upon which the Pittsburgh facility of the Bureau of Mines is located. Specifies that such University shall pay to the United States an amount not less than the fair market value of such property or the cost of the replacement facility, up to $5,400,000. Makes such conveyance contingent upon the readiness of alternative facilities for the Bureau of Mines and the leasing of specified buildings at the Pittsburgh facility for the occupancy and use of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Permits the Secretary to enlarge, equip, and improve the research facility of the Bureau of Mines near Bruceton, Pennsylvania, and to transfer operations of the Bureau of Mines from the facility at Pittsburgh to the facility near Bruceton. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose."
