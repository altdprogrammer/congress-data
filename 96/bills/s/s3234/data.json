Kennedy Center Act to increase to $21,900,000 the face value of revenue bonds issued to the Secretary of the Treasury by the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to finance necessary parking facilities for the center. Directs the Board to sue the proceeds of such revenue bonds to pay the debt of the Center to Airport Parking Company of America, Washington, Incorporated, the operator of the parking facilities of the Center. Directs the Board, for each calendar year beginning after October 1, 1980, to apply the Center's net revenues from the parking facilities, of the Center, but in any case not less than $500,000 per annum, toward retiring such bonds issued to the Secretary of the Treasury. States that no interest shall accrue on such bonds for any period after the date of enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to forgive the Board from payment of any and all interest (including deferred interest) otherwise due or accrued on such bonds as of the date of enactment of this Act. Makes any increase in the borrowing authority provided by this Act, effective only to the extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts."
