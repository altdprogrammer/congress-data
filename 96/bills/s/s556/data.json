Stipulates that each such project must contain benefits directly related to agriculture that account for at least 20 percent of the total benefits of the project. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Administrator of the Soil Conservation Service to report by April 1, 1980, to the appropriate committees of the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the feasibility, desirability, and the public interest involved in requiring that full public access be provided to specified water impoundments that have a recreational-related potential."
