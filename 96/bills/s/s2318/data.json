Exlcudes any lands, waters, and interest therein within the boundary of such park which were within any national forest from the national forest. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire any or all of specified lands in the State of Washington to make possible more effective protection of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness and more comprehensive and effective management of the management unit within the Alpine Lakes Area. Specifies that such lands may be acquired by donation or exchange for national forest lands or other lands administered by the Forest Service in the same State having a value approximately equal to the value of the lands so acquired, as determined by the Secretary. Permits the Secretary to accept cash or pay cash to the grantor in such an exchange in order to equalize minor differences in the values of the properties exchange. Makes any lands so acquired, upon acceptance of title, a part of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington."
