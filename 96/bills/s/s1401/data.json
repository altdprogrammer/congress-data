Authorizes the Commission to order an interim rate increase pending a final order determining a just and reasonable increase. Prohibits retroactive application of any final approved rate, but requires refunds to customers if the final order is less than the interim order. Requires a hearing on the record for any increased rate if: (1) the Commission has reason to believe such increase may not be just and reasonable; or (2) the Commission receives a valid complaint in relation to the requested increase from either direct or indirect customers."
