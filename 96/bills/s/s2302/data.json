Increases the specified area available for such purpose. Designates such Act as the International Center Act. Repeals provisions regarding a headquarters building for the Organization of American States within such area. Authorizes the GSA to design, construct and equip a headquarters building, legation building, or related facilities, on property within such area, if so requested by any foreign government or international organization. Requires any such buildings constructed in such area to be subject to the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission. Includes demolition or removal of existing structures and site preparation within the services to be provided by the Secretary, GSA, and the D.C. government within or contiguous to such area. Includes such services for other utilities and related improvements within such authority. Permits the Secretary to retain a reserve for maintenance of public improvements out of the proceeds from the sale, exchange, or lease of such property to foreign governments or international organizations."
