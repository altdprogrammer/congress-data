    "date": "1980-09-29", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to establish a DEA Senior Executive Service (DEA/SES). Requires the DEA/SES to be administered according to provisions which largely parallel provisions governing the Federal Senior Executive Service. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) appoint, promote, demote, reassign, and remove an employee in connection with a DEA/SES position; and (2) remove such a senior executive from the civil service. Directs the Attorney General, subject to the final authority of the President, to establish positions as DEA/SES positions. Amends the Crime Control Act of 1976 to exempt such positions from the competitive service. Directs the Administrator to establish a performance appraisal system for DEA senior executives which provides that: (1) written performance requirements shall be communicated to the senior executives prior to the rating period; (2) each executive shall be furnished with a copy of his or her appraisal and rating; and (3) an executive may not appeal such appraisal or rating. Specifies the criteria for such appraisals. Directs the Administrator to prescribe an annual summary rating levels of performance as part of such system. Requires the establishment of career development programs for the DEA/SES which are consistent with such programs under the Federal Senior Executive Service. Permits the Administrator to grant sabbatical leave to qualified senior executives. Authorizes the President, upon recommendation of the Attorney General, to award ranks to members of the DEA/SES. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) establish the rates of pay for DEA/SES positions; (2) grant performance awards in a manner consistent with provisions governing performance awards for Federal SES members; and (3) pay travel and per diem expenses incurred by new appointees and candidates to the DES/SES in connection with preemployment interviews requested by the Administrator and moves of new appointees to their first post of duty. Qualifies DEA/SES members for civil service annuities on the same basis as members of the Federal SES."
