Sets forth requirements relating to the price and amount of such grain. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of loans to alcohol fuel processors to allow them to purchase and store grain so as to provide them with a dependable supply of grain at a reasonable price. Establishes an alcohol processor grain reserve program, under which the Secretary shall assist such processors in the costs of storing grain for use in alcohol production. Directs the Secretary to use the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the purposes of the alcohol processor grain reserve program. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to any processors eligible for a loan under this Act to assist in the construction or remodeling of a grain storage facility for grain intended for alcohol production. Terminates the Secretary's authority to make such loans five years after enactment of this Act."
