Title VII: Subsistence - Declares the first priority of this Act to be consumptive uses of fishing and other renewable resources for nonwasteful subsistence uses by local rural residents. Stipulates that restrictions on the taking of populations of fish and wildlife on such lands for subsistence uses in order to protect the continued viability of such populations, or to continue such uses, shall be based on: (1) customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the mainstay of livelihood; (2) local residency; and (3) the availability of alternative resources. Directs the Secretary, if the State fails to do so, to establish: (1) at least seven Alaska subsistence resource regions which, taken together, include all public lands; (2) such local advisory committees within each region, as necessary, based upon a finding that the existing State fish and game advisory committees do not adequately assist in the preparation of the reports required of the regional councils; and (3) a regional advisory council in each subsistence region, to be composed of residents of the affected region. Sets forth the duties of such regional councils in regard to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within the regions, including the preparation of annual reports to the Secretary. Requires that such reports contain identifications, evaluations and recommended strategies for the management of fish and wildlife populations within the regions, as well as recommendations concerning policies, standards, guidelines, and regulations to implement such strategies. Directs the Secretary to follow the advice of such councils unless he determines in writing that such advice is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs. Directs the Secretary to take certain administrative action if it is determined that the program or implementation is not in compliance with this Act. Gives the Secretary authority to close public areas to all consumptive uses except subsistence uses by local residents. Sets forth procedures for hearings and appeal by the State.
