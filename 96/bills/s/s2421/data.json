    "text": "Federal Protective Service Act of 1980 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to establish a permanent security force within the General Services Administration to be known as the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Prescribes the duties and authority of the officers of the FPS which primarily involve the protection of persons and property on real property under the control of the Administration. Directs the Administrator: (1) to establish grades for FPS positions which correspond to the grades of comparable positions in the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division (Division); and (2) to furnish FPS officers with uniforms and equipment similar to the uniforms and equipment of Division members. Excludes FPS officers, Division members, and special policemen of the Veterans' Administration from provisions of Federal law governing the classification and premium pay of civil service positions. Includes such officers, members, and special policemen under provisions which: (1) concern the protection of officers of the United States; and (2) prohibit requiring certain policemen to use sick leave for an absence due to an inquiry sustained in the performance of duty. Includes such officers or special policemen within the definition of the term \"law enforcement officer\" for purposes of provisions concerning civil service retirement. Requires the United States to make a lump sum payment of $50,000 to the survivors of a Federal fire fighter or law enforcement officer who dies as a result of injuries sustained in the performance of duty. Increases the penalties for violations of regulations governing the protection of persons and property on lands and buildings under the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Administration. Requires the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs: (1) to establish grades for special policemen of the Veterans' Administration which correspond to the grades of comparable Division positions; and (2) to furnish such policemen with uniforms and equipment similar to the uniforms and equipment of Division members."
