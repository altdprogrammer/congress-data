    "text": "Earth Data and Information Service Act of 1979 - Establishes the Earth Data and Information Service within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to collect, interpret, compile, and distribute data obtained by remote sensing satellites and other sources on the quality and quantity of the Earth's resources and environment. Directs the Service to: (1) provide rapid processing of, and ready access to, such data at a reasonable cost to both foreign and domestic users; (2) promote competition among suppliers of equipment and services to the Service; and (3) make available to all users remote sensing data and basis information products. Authorizes the Administrator of the NASA to plan, initiate, construct, acquire, own, manage, and operate an Earth Data and Information System to provide a reliable source of useful data and basic information products to users. Directs the Administrator to include in such system sensing satellites, ground equipment, data reception devices and other equipment designed to contribute to the understanding of the Earth's resources and environment. Authorizes the Administrator to establish communication networks to transmit such data and products to users on a timely basis and to consult with the National Telecommunications Information Agency of the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications Commission in establishing such networks. Stipulates that the communication services needed for such networks, insofar as practicable, shall be procured from the private sector. Authorizes the Administrator, under the President's supervision, to participate in a program of international activities related to the functions of the Service. Directs the Administrator to establish a schedule of user charges for products and services provided under this Act. Sets forth penalties for unlawful reproduction for sale or distribution of any data or basic information products produced by the Service. Specifies procedures by which the President may transfer to the Service related functions of any other Federal department or agency. Requires the Administrator to present to the President, who shall transmit to Congress in January of each year, a report containing a description of the activities and accomplishments of the Service during the preceding year. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
