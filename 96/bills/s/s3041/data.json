Declares that such wilderness designation shall not: (1) restrict vehicular traffic on lands seaward of the toe of the dune beyond restrictions in effect in the remainder of the seashore area; (2) interfere with present maintenance practices for public utility cables within the wilderness area; (3) preclude the repair of breaches that occur either in the wilderness area or in the remainder of the Fire Island National Seashore; or (4) preclude maintenance of the boardwalk and other existing facilities in the vicinity of the Old Inlet. Specifies that any decision by the Federal Government to return Fire Island National Seashore to State and/or local governments shall terminate the wilderness status created by this Act."
