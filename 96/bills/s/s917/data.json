    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to authorize appropriations of $33,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1981, and $47,000,000 for fiscal year 1982, to carry out the purposes of such Act. Defines \"fisheries\" to include the cultivation, taking, or harvesting of fish, and marine animals or vegetation within the U.S. fishery conservation zone, for the purpose of regulating foreign fishing. Defines \"certification\" as a determination made by the Secretary of Commerce that foreign vessels are conducting fishing operations or engaging in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling for the purpose of reducing a nation's allocation of the total allowable level of foreign fishing within the U.S. fishery conservation zone. Requires the Secretary of State to reduce the allocation of a nation so certified by not less than 50 percent. Requires the Secretary of State to reallocate the unharvested portion of a certified nation's allocation among other foreign nations, if the Secretary of Commerce notifies him that it is not likely the certification of such nation will be terminated before the end of the allocation period or one year (which ever first occurs). Amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to direct the Secretary of Commerce or the Interior to monitor and investigate the activities of foreign nations that may affect any international fisheries conservation program and to promptly reach a decision with respect to any such investigation. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to document the vessel Widow Maker as a vessel of the United States for the purpose of engaging in the coastwise trade and the fisheries of the United States."
