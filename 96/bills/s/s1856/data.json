Authorizes the Secretaries to provide technical assistance to State water resource investigations. Requires the State to repay 25 percent of the cost of such investigation or assistance. Sets forth the requirements for feasibility reports, describing water resource problems and proposed solutions, prepared after such investigations. Permits the Secretaries to construct intrastate water resource development projects after submitting such feasibility reports upon: (1) State request; (2) a State agreement to repay the entire Federal costs; and (3) congressional authorization. Requires non-Federal entities to reimburse the United States for interstate water resource development projects according to specified formulas. Stipulates that: (1) authorizations for water resource development projects shall be based on the feasibility reports; (2) a single Act shall authorize the appropriations for both the engineering and design and construction phases; and (3) Congress will review the authorization of appropriations after such phases are completed only if the engineering and design studies reveal significant differences from the project described in the feasibility report."
