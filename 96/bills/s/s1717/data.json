    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Federal criminal code to provide, with respect to an interception of communications where surreptitious entry is required, that: (1) the application for an order state why other means of effecting the interception reasonably appear unlikely to succeed, or are too dangerous or impracticable; (2) the court find probable cause to believe that surreptitious entry reasonably appears to be required; and (3) an order authorizing interception specify whether surreptitious entry is approved and, if so: (A) the identify of the agency authorized to make such entry, and (B) in any case in which more than one entry is required, the reasons which necessitate the reentry. Requires an authorizing judge to report orders approving surreptitious entries to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Allows the interception of communications without a court order in emergency situations involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person (current law limits it to conspiracies involving national security or organized crime)."
