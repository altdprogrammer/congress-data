    "text": "Weather Resources Management Act of 1979 - Establishes a National Weather Resources Management Program to develop and improve weather resources management technologies. Establishes within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration a Weather Resources Management Board to advise the Administrator of such agency on organizing, planning, designing, developing, and carrying out such Program. Provides that such Program shall include: (1) basic research focused on atmospheric process; (2) the conduct of experimental activities; (3) the provision of technical and financial assistance to the States and their political subdivisions, private users and operators; and (4) the development and maintenance of a set of Best Management Practices for all weather modification activities. Directs that such program shall be carried out through a comprehensive five-year plan that is to be updated annually and submitted to the President and the Congress. Requires the Board to develop, formulate, publish, and maintain a set of South Weather Resources Management Practices regarding project design, environmental assessments, operations, data collection, and evaluations. Requires that research or operational activity by the Administrator comply with such practices. Requires any person who attempts weather modification to prepare and maintain daily reports covering such activities, and to make such reports available to the Administration. Prescribes penalties for violations of such reporting requirements. Gives the district court jurisdiction to enjoin any weather modification activity by any person violating regulations promulgated by the Administrator under this Act. Authorizes the Administration to make grants and enter into contracts for the conduct of research, development, and demonstration projects concerning weather modification. Transfers all functions, personnel, property, funds, and other assets of Federal agencies with respect to weather resources management to the Administration. Requires the Board to consult and cooperate with the States which are affected by such operations and activities. Provides that exemptions from the tort claims procedure shall not apply to claims based on the Administration's weather modification activities. Permits class actions under the Federal tort claims procedure. Prohibits a private cause of action for the Administration's failure to comply with the Sound Weather Resources Management Practices. Terminates the Board 20 years after the date of enactment. Repeals existing law concerning weather modification reporting requirements."
