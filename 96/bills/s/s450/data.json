    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1979-04-09", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #40 (61-30)) Supreme Court Jurisdiction Act of 1979 - Limits the circumstances under which parties have a right to appeal cases to the United States Supreme Court. Leaves unaffected provisions in current law establishing Supreme Court review by writ of certiorari or by certification of questions of law by the appropriate courts. Eliminates from current law: (1) the provision authorizing a party to appeal to the Supreme Court a decision invalidating an Act of Congress; (2) the provision authorizing a party to appeal to the Supreme Court by relying on a State statute which has been held by a court of appeals to be invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States; (3) the provisions authorizing the review by the Supreme Court of final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be made, where (A) the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question and the decision is against its validity, or (B) the validity of a State statute is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity; (4) the provision under the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 allowing a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of any decision on a matter certified to a court of appeals under such Act; and (5) the provision establishing the right of either the Indians of California or the United States to appeal to the Supreme Court claims against the Government for appropriated lands. Amends the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act to provide that review of any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of the district courts in actions arising under such Act may be had only upon direct review by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari. Removes the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review any case arising out of any State statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or arising out of any Act enforcing such State laws which related to voluntary prayers in public schools and public buildings. Provides that the district courts shall not have jurisdiction over any such case that the Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction to review. Sets forth the effective date of this Act as the date of enactment and excludes cases pending on such date from such limitations."
