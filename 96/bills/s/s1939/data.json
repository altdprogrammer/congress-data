    "text": "Amends the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act to require that initial pleadings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico be filed in either the Spanish or English language. Requires further pleadings and proceedings to be in English, unless: (1) the defendant in a criminal case requests that they be in Spanish; (2) all parties in a civil case agree that they be in Spanish; or (3) the court orders such pleadings and proceedings to be in Spanish. Specifies language provisions for court opinions and appeals. Prohibits the disqualification of persons on a grand or petit jury in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico solely because of a person's inability to speak, read, write, and understand English if such person is able to speak, read, write, and understand the language in which the proceeding for which the juror is called is to be conducted. Allows the Government attorney to determine whether a grand jury is to be conducted in English or Spanish. Directs the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to report periodically to Congress on the implementation of this Act. Makes the provisions of this Act effective one year and 180 days after enactment."
