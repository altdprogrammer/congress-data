Authorizes appropriations out of the sums already authorized for fiscal year 1981 for programs in education in appropriate technology, ethics and values in science and technology, and minorities, women and the handicapped in science. Requires that not less than ten percent of the funds for equipment and instrumentation in fiscal year 1981 be made available for grants to two-and four-year colleges for equipment and instrumentation costing less than a specified amount.
