    "text": "Small Business Issuers' Simplification Act of 1980 - Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to allow small issuers to make offerings of their securities to accredited investors without filing a registration statement, provided there is no advertising or public solicitation in connection with the transaction. Permits an accredited investor who acquires securities in such a transaction to resell such securities to other accredited investors without filing a registration statement under the exemption for transactions not involving an underwriter. Defines the term \"accredited investor\" to include specified institutional investors and any person purchasing at least $100,000 of securities in such an offering by a small issuer. Requires a small issuer to meet two of the three following criteria in order to qualify for the exemption provided by this Act: (1) assets at the end of its fiscal year of less than $15,000,000; (2) gross revenues in each of its last two fiscal years of less than $30,000,000; and (3) no more than 500 shareholders of any class of its securities. Empowers the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise the definitions and criteria established by this Act."
