    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 5176 passed in lieu) General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 - Authorizes the Comptroller General to appoint, pay, assign, and direct such personnel as the Comptroller General determines are necessary to perform the functions and duties of the General Accounting Office (GAO). Directs the Comptroller General to establish a personnel management system for the GAO after providing notice and an opportunity for public comment. Requires that such personnel system conform with specified provisions of title 5 of the United States Code (Government Organization and Employees) concerning: (1) the merit system principles; (2) prohibited personnel practices; (3) prohibited political activities; (4) the pay comparability systems; (5) performance appraisal; (6) employee organizations; (7) labor-management relations; (8) suspensions and actions against employees based on unacceptable service; and (9) the minority recruitment program. States that GAO employees shall be appointed, assigned, and promoted without regard to provisions governing personnel actions in the competitive service. Requires that such system provide preference to an eligible individual in a manner consistent with preference accorded to preference eligible individuals, including veterans, in the executive branch. Directs the Comptroller General to publish a pay schedule for GAO employees under which the highest rate of pay does not exceed the maximum rate for a GS-15 under the General Schedule. Authorizes special rates not to exceed the maximum rate for a GS-18 for up to 100 employees. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as abolishing or diminishing any right or remedy granted to an employee or applicant for employment in the GAO by any law prohibiting discrimination in Federal employment. Transfers authorities granted by any such law in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board to either the General Accounting Office Appeals Board or the Comptroller General with respect to GAO employees and applicants. Establishes the General Accounting Office Personnel Appeals Board. Sets forth provisions governing the appointment, qualifications, terms of office, and compensation of the five members of the Board. Provides for the appointment of a general counsel of the Board who shall investigate: (1) allegations concerning prohibited personnel practices and prohibited political activities; and (2) as requested, other matters under the Board's jurisdiction. Authorizes the Board (or a member or panel of members as may be designated by the Board) to consider and order the Comptroller General to take corrective or disciplinary action in cases concerning: (1) employee appeals regarding removal from work or reduction in grade or pay; (2) prohibited personnel or labor practices; (3) prohibited political activities; and (4) collective bargaining units and representatives. Sets forth procedures for review and appeal of decisions of the Board. Directs the Board to prescribe regulations: (1) providing for employee appeals; and (2) establishing its operating procedure. Authorizes the Comptroller General to establish: (1) a GAO Senior Executive Service which conforms to specified provisions of law governing the Senior Executive Service; and (2) a merit pay system for GAO employees to carry out purposes consistent with the merit pay system for Federal employees. Declares that any GAO employee who completes one year of continuous service under the personnel system established by this Act acquires a competitive status for appointment in the competitive service. Directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to assist the Comptroller General, on request, in establishing the GAO personnel system. Sets forth conforming and technical amendments. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
