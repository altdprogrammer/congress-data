Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $1,000 ($2,000 for married couples filing jointly). Requires a minimum aggregate adjusted basis of such securities at the end of the credit year or no credit shall be allowed. Disallows such credit if the taxpayer possesses 80 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote. Requires recapture of such credits upon reduction of the aggregate adjusted basis of such securities below a specified level."
