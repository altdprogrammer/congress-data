    "text": "Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to replace specified references to \"exemptions\" with references to \"interim variances\" and to replace a reference to \"exempt public water systems\" with a reference to \"public water systems granted interim variances.\" Permits State-prescribed public water system schedules to require compliance with less stringent contaminant levels or treatment techniques during a period of interim variance. Mandates that such schedules require final compliance with each contaminant level and treatment technique requirement for which such interim variance was granted by a specified date. Sets such date at: (1) the later of January 1, 1988, or seven years after such requirement takes effect; or (2) in cases where the public water system has entered into an enforceable agreement to become part of a regional public water system, the later of January 1, 1992, or nine years after such requirement takes effect. Permits a State with primary enforcement responsibility to determine that the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means need not be constructed and in place before a variance may be granted."
