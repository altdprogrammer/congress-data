Stipulates that such payments shall take into account the economic circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child. Defines a child with special needs as a child who: (1) cannot or should not be returned to his or her biological family; (2) is difficult to place because of ethnic background, age, or physical or mental handicaps; and (3) has not been able to be placed with appropriate adoptive parents without adoption assistance payments."
