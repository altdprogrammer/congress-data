    "text": "Department of Agriculture Nutrition Labeling and Information Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, after consultation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to develop and implement a nutrition labeling and information system for meat, meat food products, poultry, and poultry products capable of use as human food. Specifies general contents of such nutrition labeling. Authorizes exemptions from the requirements of this Act to the extent that compliance is impracticable, would result in unfair competition, or is not necessary to provide such health information to consumers. Vests the United States district courts with jurisdiction to specifically enforce, and to prevent and restrain violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to approve demonstrations to ascertain the most effective methods of organizing the information on labels of such meat and poultry products. Requires written evaluations of such demonstrations. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and publish a standardized reference on the nutrient composition of all foods. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 for the development of such reference. Directs the Secretary to notify the Federal Trade Commission of the nutrition information required on labeling and to recommend what information should be required on advertising. Requires the Secretary to develop and promulgate a system of retail quality grade standards for meat, poultry, and dairy products, fresh fruits, and vegetables, expressed in a uniform nonmenclature. Requires all such products sold after implementation of such standards to be conspicuously labeled with such standards, or with the statement: \"Not quality graded by the United States Department of Agriculture.\" Requires implementation of the grade system two years after enactment."
