    "text": "Methane Transportation Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to designate an organizational entity within the Department of Energy to manage the methane vehicle research, development, and demonstration program established under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements or arrangements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, or any other Federal department or agency, providing that such departments or agencies conduct specified parts or aspects of such program as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate which are within the particular competence of such department or agency. States that the Secretary shall have responsibility to ascertain that such program include activities to: (1) promote research on methane-fueled vehicles; (2) determine optimum overall specifications for such vehicles; (3) determine means and facilities for storing, transporting, and dispensing methane for use as vehicular fuel; (4) conduct demonstration projects with respect to the feasibility of such vehicles; (5) gather performance data on such vehicles and related methane transmission and storage facilities; (6) enter into arrangements to assure adequate continuous supplies of methane for use in the demonstrations assisted under this Act; (7) ascertain the need for modifying available methane-fueled vehicles in order to improve their efficiency and performance and facilitate their use by fleet owners; and (8) ascertain and report to Congress on any changes in fuel supply patterns, tax policies, and standards governing the manufacture of vehicles needed to facilitate the manufacture and use of such vehicles. Directs the Secretary to assure maximum coordination between Federal agencies and departments and the Department of Energy in carrying out such program. Directs the Secretary to initiate and provide for research and development in areas relating to such vehicles. Directs the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations and to issue an initial report for proposals for technical and financial assistance to support public and private entities in developing and implementing demonstration projects to gather data on the operation of such vehicles and facilities for the transmission and storage of methane as a vehicular fuel. Sets forth the types of technical and financial assistance to be provided under this Act, including grants and loans to cover specified percentages of the costs associated with the installation of methane transmission, storage, and dispensing facilities. Sets forth requirements as to the number and duration of such demonstrations. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Postmaster General, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other Federal agencies to determine the practicability of using methane vehicles in the performance of agency functions and to arrange for appropriate use of such vehicles at the earliest practicable date. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report on all activities undertaken under this Act to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1986 to carry out this Act."
