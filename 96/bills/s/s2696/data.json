    "text": "National Ridesharing Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish within the Department of Transportation a National Office of Ridesharing to develop a national program to assist State, regional, and local governments and others in developing and implementing ridesharing programs. Directs the Office to coordinate programs authorized under this Act with other Federal ridesharing activities. Sets forth ridesharing services and programs for which funding shall be made available. Prohibits the use of such funding for the construction of high occupancy vehicle facilities and the purchase or operation of public transit vehicles. Directs that the national ridesharing program shall be administered in a flexible manner to ensure participation of State departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations, counties, municipalities, providers of ridesharing services, publicly owned operators of mass transportation services, other local transportation planning and implementation agencies, and the private sector. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in making discretionary apportionments to eligible recipients, to give special consideration to those applicants who have shown particular commitment to ridesharing by virtue of their use of non-Federal funds or eligible Federal highway funds in their ridesharing programs. Directs the Secretary to conduct an investigation of the performance of the Office and report to the President, Congress, and the public on such investigation by September 30, 1983. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of this Act for fiscal years 1981 through 1984."
