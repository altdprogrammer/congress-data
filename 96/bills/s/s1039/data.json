    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate H. R. 3892 passed in lieu) Veterans' Administration Health Resources and Programs Extension Act of 1979 - =Title I: Extension and Improvement of Certain Veterans' Administration Health Programs= - Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for grants to States for the construction, expansion, remodeling, or alteration of State homes furnishing domiciliary, nursing home, or hospital care to veterans. Stipulates that no State may receive more than one-third of the amount appropriated during any fiscal year or $3,000,000, whichever is greater. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to enter into agreements with public or nonprofit private institutions in order to participate in cooperative health-care personnel education programs in areas remote from major academic health centers. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for the Exchange of Medical Information program. Increases the per diem payments to States for providing domiciliary, nursing home, and hospital care to veterans in State home facilities. =Title II: Realignment of Veterans Health Care and Related Benefits= - Provides that no payment for travel expenses incurred going to and from a Veterans Administration (VA) facility may be made except: (1) for travel by special vehicular mode of transportation that is required for medical reasons or in a medical emergency, and (2) when the person claiming reimbursement is receiving or eligible to receive a non-service-connected disability pension. Limits the amount of payment to such persons in any fiscal year to $100. Specifies that such payment shall be limited to the excess over four dollars of the cost of such travel. Authorizes the Administrator to reimburse certain eligible veterans for the payment of reasonable charges for chiropractic services. Limits the amount of such reimbursement to $200 in any 12 month period. Limits total expenditures for chiropractic services to $4,000,000 annually and provides that no such reimbursement may be made for chiropractic services furnished after September 30, 1983. Directs the Administrator to prepare and submit annual reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the use made of such chiropractic services reimbursement authorities. Authorizes the Administrator to provide outpatient dental care for veterans with service-connected noncompensable dental conditions or disabilities if such veteran: (1) has served on active duty for at least 180 days; (2) has made application for dental treatment within six months after discharge; and (3) the Secretary concerned has not certified that the veteran was provided a complete dental examination and all appropriate dental services and treatment during the 90 days immediately prior to such veteran's discharge. Stipulates that such assistance may not be furnished through a contract with a private facility at a cost of more than $500 during any 12-month period unless the Administrator determines that the care at such cost is reasonably necessary. Provides that nonprescription drugs, medicines, or medical supplies may not be furnished to veterans receiving non-service-connected outpatient care unless such veteran is eligible to receive non-service-connected disability pension or the Administrator authorizes the furnishing of such drugs, medicines, or medical supplies in order to avoid substantial hardship that would otherwise result. Exempts veterans with service connected disabilities receiving non-service-connected outpatient care from such restrictions. Authorizes the Administrator to provide home health care services to housebound veterans or veterans receiving additional aid and attendance benefits (or who would be so entitled except for retired pay). Authorizes the Administrator to provide medical care for surviving dependents of a person dying in active military service and not due to misconduct. Provides that a child between 18 and 23 who is eligible for such benefits who suffers a disabling illness or injury while in full-time attendance at an approved educational institution which prevents him from resuming such attendance, shall remain eligible for such benefits for six months after the disability is removed, until two years after such illness' onset, or until the student's twenty-third birthday. Provides eligibility for such benefits to the remarried surviving spouse of a person who died during active service when the surviving spouse's remarriage has terminated. Stipulates that provisions in this Act regarding reimbursement for certain non-service-connected travel, out-patient dental care for certain service-connected dental conditions, and the furnishing of non-prescription drugs, medicines, and supplies in connection with non-service-connected outpatient care shall take effect and remain in effect when the Veterans' Administration is provided by the Office of Management and Budget with certain personnel ceilings for which appropriations have been made. Includes World War I veterans as the fifth priority, for receipt of outpatient medical services. =Title III: Veterans Administration Medical Personnel and Miscellaneous Amendments= - Includes psychologists within the list of those who may be appointed by the Administrator to positions in the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery. Sets forth qualification standards for such appointments. Requires podiatrists and optometrists to be United States citizens in order to be appointed to such Department. Shortens the probationary period for medical appointments to such Department from three to two years. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into sharing agreements with organ and blood banks, and other similar institutions. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct an epidemiological study of the long-term health effects on humans from exposure to dioxins, especially those in herbicides used during the Vietnam conflict. Directs that a report on such study be submitted to the appropriate committees of the Congress."
