Directs the Secretary to determine the validity of such application based on whether such individual: (1) served in the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines (including organized guerilla units) while such forces were in the service of the United States Armed Forces; (2) was awarded the Purple Heart or other decoration; and (3) was inducted into the United States Armed Forces in the Far East before World War II, served during such war, and whose name was erroneously removed from United States Armed Forces records."
