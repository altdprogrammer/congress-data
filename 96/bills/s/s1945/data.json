    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on on Governmental Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 96-866) Agency Accountability Act of 1980 - Requires each Federal agency: (1) to prepare a semiannual agenda listing all areas in which the agency intends to propose significant rules during the next twelve months; and (2) to transmit such agenda to the committee in each House of Congress having primary jurisdiction over the statute pursuant to which each such rule may be issued. Requires that the agenda indicate the areas of proposed rulemaking which are subject to congressional review under this Act. Defines the terms: (1) \"major rule\" as a rule which is likely to have an effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more in any one year to cause a major change affecting a specific business, local government, or region; and (2) \"significant rule\" as any rule which the agency determines to be significant according to specified criteria. Declares that the congressional review provisions of this Act will apply to a significant rule only if the majority of members of the appropriate committee of each House vote for such applicability. Directs each agency to forward a copy of each proposed and final major or significant rule to the appropriate committee of each House on the same day such rule is sent to the Federal Register for publication. Prohibits any such rule from becoming effective: (1) within 20 days after it is transmitted to such committee; (2) within 60 days after any such committee reports a joint resolution disapproving the rule, unless either House rejects the resolution or Congress adjourns sine die before such period has expired; or (3) if such a joint resolution is enacted into law. Authorizes the head of an agency to waive the requirements of this Act with respect to a rule upon determining that the rule is being issued in response to exceptional circumstances requiring immediate agency action in the public interest or that the contents of the rule must be kept confidential prior to the effective date of the rule, if the agency head submits written notice of such determination to the appropriate committees. Exempts the compliance of an agency with the requirements of this Act from judicial review. States that this Act shall become effective at the beginning of the Ninety-seventh Congress, and shall lapse January 1, 1987."
