Title II: Implementation of Policy - Directs the President to: (1) aid in the planning, development, and review of the information service; (2) coordinate Government agency activities in the field of earth resources information; and (3) take necessary steps to insure that every Federal entity utilizes the information service. Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to advise the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on technical aspects of the information service and to assist and cooperate with the Earth Resources Information Corporation established by this Act in developing the information service. Specifies the duties of the FCC with respect to the information service, including the insurance of fair competition and standards of quality in the earth resources information service. Title III: Creation of an Earth Resources Information Corporation - Establishes an Earth Resources Information Corporation for profit which is not an agency or establishment of the United States. Authorizes the Corporation to plan, initiate, construct, own, manage, and operate a commercial earth resources information service. Enumerates other functions of the Corporation, including ownership and operation of earth resources satellites, receiving stations and information distribution centers. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Directs the Corporation to notify the Department of State when entering into business negotiations with any international or foreign entity. Prohibits any person, other than through official channels, from selling or disclosing to any other person any earth resources information which is compiled by the Corporation. Prescribes sanctions, including equitable relief, for actions by the Corporation which are inconsistent with the policies set forth in this Act. Directs the President to transmit to Congress each January a description of activities and accomplishments for the preceding year. Requires the Corporation to make annual reports to the President and Congress concerning its operations, activities, and accomplishments. Directs the FCC to transmit annually to Congress: (1) a report of its actions on anticompetitive practices as they apply to such service; (2) an evaluation of such actions with a view to recommending additional legislation; and (3) an evaluation of the capital structure of the Corporation."
