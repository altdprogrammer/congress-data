Grants a preference right to purchase such lands at their 1967 value to American citizens who claim under color of title or as riparian owners whether or not the Secretary offers the property involved for public sale. States that if such preference right is not exercised, the Secretary may either sell such property at its present value or withdraw it from sale."
