Provides that, for each complete year of service, amounts eligible to be repaid or cancelled are: (1) $500 or ten percent of the loan, for enlisted members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces; or (2) $1,000 or 20 percent of the loan, whichever is greater, for enlisted members of the Armed Forces on active duty. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts for such purposes for fiscal year 1981 through 1985. Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe a fund allocation schedule during any year for which such appropriation is not sufficient to pay the sum of the amounts eligible for repayment or cancellation, giving priority for service that qualifies for special pay in an area of hostilities."
