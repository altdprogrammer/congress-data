    "text": "Urban Service Corps Act - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to establish as a new program, the Urban Service Corps. Authorizes the Director of the ACTION Agency to develop and conduct, directly or through grants and contracts to public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, full- and part-time volunteer programs in urban areas with substantial unemployment and financial distress. Stipulates that such programs may include, but are not limited to: (1) volunteer service, with training and education, for unemployed youth; (2) block security, housing renovation, park beautification, and sanitation services; (3) child care, services to the elderly; disabled and infirm, and alternatives to institutionalization; and (4) technical assistance to businesses in deteriorating neighborhoods. Authorizes the Director to: (1) determine the terms and conditions of assignment for volunteers in such programs; (2) provide such volunteers with allowances, stipends, and other support, not to exceed those authorized for VISTA volunteers; and (3) provide technical and financial assistance to public and private nonprofit groups using such volunteers. Requires the Director to insure coordination of such programs with other public and private programs. Limits financial aid to public or private groups to 90 percent of the approved cost of the project. Authorizes the Director to approve assistance in excess of such limitation in specified instances."
