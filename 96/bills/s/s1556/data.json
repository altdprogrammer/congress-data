Requires the Secretary to determine the number of woodlot owners in each State. Authorizes the Secretary to make forest fuel utilization training programs available to State foresters, or equivalent State officials, in States in which forest growth is underutilized and in which there is a potential for the utilization of wood as a fuel in place of oil. Directs: (1) the Secretary of Energy to develop a plan to increase the assistance and information provided to the Forest Service by the Department of Energy; and (2) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to develop a plan to increase the managerial assistance and information provided to small woodlot owners and wood fuel distributors and marketers by the Small Business Administration."
