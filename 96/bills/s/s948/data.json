Rept. 96-204) Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to repeal provisions which require that small hydroelectric power projects utilize existing dams in order to be eligible for Federal assistance. Revises the definition of \"small hydroelectric power project\" to mean any such project which has not more than 25,000 kilowatts of installed capacity (present law limits to 15,000 kilowatts). Authorizes additional appropriations for fiscal years 1981 and 1982 for Federal loans to assist in the costs of such projects."
