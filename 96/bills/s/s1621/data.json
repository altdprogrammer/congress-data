Limits the amount of such credit to $100 ($200 in the case of a joint return). Provides that the taxpayer must hold such equipment financing bonds for at least 84 months after purchase, or else pay a tax penalty in the year of sale of 150 percent of the amount allowed as a credit as a result of the purchase of such bonds. Defines \"equipment financing bond\" as a bond which is used to finance the purchase of property for which an investment tax credit is allowable."
