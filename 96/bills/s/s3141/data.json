    "text": "Public Contract Accountability Act of 1980 - Repeals provisions of Federal law which provide exemptions from the advertising requirement for Government purchases of and contracts for property and services with regard to: (1) services which are required to be performed by the contractor in person and which are of a technical or professional nature or under Government supervision and paid for on a time basis; (2) personal or professional services; (3) any service rendered by an educational institution; (4) which it is impractical to secure competition; and (5) research work. Prohibits any executive agency or military department from making progress payments which exceed 65 percent of the price of a contract worth more than $100,000 until the agency conducts an audit and determines that: (1) the expenditure of funds for the work performed is reasonable; (2) the work performed meets contract specifications; and (3) the work performed is satisfactory. Prohibits an executive agency or military department from entering into any contract for services unless the agency has conducted a survey and has determined that such services are not readily available within the agency."
