    "text": "Omnibus Geothermal Energy Development Act of 1979 - Title I: Findings and Purposes - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to accelerate the development of geothermal energy in the United States. Title II: Amendments to the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970-Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to expand the acreage limitation on holders of geothermal leases to 51,200 acres, except as specified. Provides for an expedited bidding and leasing system for lands within any known geothermal resources area. Establishes the Interagency Geothermal Leasing Committee to review the activities of the several agencies and departments pursuant to this Act and to take such action as necessary to fully implement this Act. Directs such Committee to report to the Interagency Geothermal Coordinating Council in response to any requests for information or recommendations. Directs such Committee to commission a training and education program on geothermal leasing and operations for Federal surface management field managers in the appropriate departments and agencies. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe amendments to existing rules and regulations and to issue any necessary new rules and regulations to carry out this Act, and exempts such actions from being construed as a \"major Federal action\" for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to develop cooperative agreements with the Governor of each State in which are located lands subject to this Act for coordination of Federal, State, and local decision making related to environmental analyses, permit approvals, and land use planning. Sets forth geothermal lease application and permit procedures. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, to establish annual goals for five future fiscal years for geothermal leasing. Requires the development of an expedited procedure for consideration and approval of permits for exploration and testing for geothermal resources. Stipulates that the establishment of such procedure shall be deemed to satisfy any requirements of NEPA applicable to any such exploration and testing activities. Permits any applicant for a geothermal lease to use a conditioned development lease with a phased environmental assessment and leasing procedure which shall limit the scope of consideration by the Secretary of the Interior as to compliance with the requirements of NEPA. Stipulates that any lessee seeking to conduct any operations of a developmental nature must prepare a detailed plan of development and utilization in accordance with requirements specified by the Secretary. Sets deadlines for review and final action on such plans. Permits exploration and testing activities on lands subject to this Act included in wilderness study areas pursuant to the Wilderness Act of 1974 and the Federal Land Management and Policy Act, so long as such activities are not conducted in a manner which would permanently impair wilderness values. Authorizes the Secretary to grant no-cost permits to specified surface owners or occupants of lands subject to this Act or to the Stock Raising Homestead Act for use of geothermal resources within such lands. Authorizes any Federal agency with an installation or facility located on or contiguous to lands subject to this Act to apply for a geothermal lease for use of geothermal resources by such installation or facility, provided that a determination has been made that such lease will not discourage or preclude commercial development of geothermal resources on such lands. Directs the Secretary to establish and implement orderly and expeditious procedures for the processing of all lease and permit applications pursuant to this Act. Title III: Amendments to the Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 - Geothermal Research, Development, and Demonstration Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 to establish the Interagency Geothermal Coordinating Council to be assisted by an Advisory Committee on Geothermal Energy. Extends the period of guaranties and interest assistance under the loan guaranty program of such Act to ten years beyond September 3, 1979. Authorizes guaranties of up to 90 percent of the aggregate cost of a geothermal resource project conducted by a publicly owned utility. Authorizes the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Administrator of the Rural Electric Administration, the Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of Energy, to utilize funds in the Geothermal Resources Development Fund established by such Act for loan or loan guaranty assistance for geothermal energy development and directly related activity by means of loan and loan guarantee programs otherwise authorized by law in such agencies and departments. Limits the total amount of such fund available for such purposes to $50,000,000 per fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish a loan program for the accelerated development of geothermal resources for non-electric applications by geothermal utility districts, geothermal industrial development districts and projects, and other persons. States that such loans shall be funded by the Geothermal Resources Development Fund. Authorizes the appropriation of $50,000,000 to such fund for fiscal year 1980. Directs the Secretary to establish and implement expeditious procedures for the processing of loan guarantee applications under such Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct a complete review of all considerations associated with the accelerated development of geopressured methane in the United States and on the Outer Continental Shelf, addressing legal, institutional, and regulatory barriers to such development and the current status of technology development to support such accelerated development. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a similar review of accelerated development of the energy potential of hot dry rock systems in the United States. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Inter-agency Geothermal Coordinating Committee and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to conduct a complete review of the need for environmental control technology, generic or specialized for a particular form of geothermal energy, to support the accelerated development of all forms of geothermal energy. Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a program in cooperation with the insurance and reinsurance industry to provide reservoir insurance to any qualified eligible applicant having a total direct investment of not less than $1,000,000 in the development and use of a geothermal resource associated with a reservoir. Authorizes the appropriation of necessary funds for the purposes of such program. Directs the Secretary to initiate a program for the utilization of geothermal energy in Federal buildings, facilities, and installations in the United States, to be developed in full coordination with existing programs for solar utilization and energy conservation. Title IV: Priority Geothermal Energy Project Act - Priority Geothermal Energy Project Act of 1979 - Declares that the purpose of this title is to provide for a coordinated, simplified, and expeditious process for Federal approval of geothermal energy facilities that are determined to be in the national interest. Directs the Secretary of Energy to designate priority geothermal energy projects based on specified criteria, and to publish a Project Decision Schedule containing deadlines for all Federal actions relating to such project. Directs the President to make any decisions or perform any actions in the event that an agency of department fails to meet its deadline. Limits environmental and judicial reviews to those of absolute necessity. Authorizes the Secretary to establish deadlines for Federal agency action which are shorter than the minimum period required under existing legislation in cases of exceptional national need. Provides for coordination of the actions of Federal, State, and local governments. Directs the Secretary to recommend to any State Governor and to the Congress actions to alleviate or prevent any delays in a priority energy project created or threatened by any State or local government. Sets time limits for filing claims arising out of actions pursuant to this title and bars any claims filed thereafter. Stipulates that such claims shall be brought in the United States court of appeals for the circuit where the project would be located, and grants exclusive original jurisdiction to such court in such matters. Directs such court to give precedence to such matters over all other matters on the court's docket to the greatest extent practicable. Authorizes the Supreme Court, exclusively, to review interlocutory judgments or orders of the court of appeals pursuant to this title, and directs the Supreme Court to give precedence to such matters to the greatest extent practicable. Prohibits the granting of injunctive relief against the issuance of any right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization pursuant to this title except in conjunction with a final judgment on a claim filed pursuant to this title. Establishes an Office for Priority Energy Projects within the Department of Energy to assist the Secretary with his duties under this title. Title V: Geothermal Amendments of 1979 to the National Energy Act of 1978 - Geothermal Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Energy Tax Act of 1978 to: (1) qualify geothermal equipment for the investment tax credit; (2) provide that the time period during which geothermal equipment may qualify for such credit shall extend to December 31, 1989; (3) eliminate as an item of tax preference, for purposes of the minimum tax, the amount by which the intangible drilling costs incurred with respect to geothermal properties exceed the net income of the taxpayer from such properties for the taxable year; and (4) permit the deduction of intangible drilling and development costs related to geothermal reinjection wells in the taxable year in which such costs are incurred. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to include facilities which produce energy from geothermal resources within the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission."
