    "text": "Diabetes Research and Training Amendments and National Diabetes Advisory Board Extension Act of 1979 - Amends title IV of the Public Health Service Act (National Research Institutes) to redesignate the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases and the Advisory Council to such Institute as the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, Diabetes, and Digestive Diseases and the National Arthritis, Metabolism, Diabetes, and Digestive Diseases Advisory Council. Establishes within the Advisory Council separate subcommittees on diabetes, arthritis, digestive diseases, and kidney diseases. Directs these subcommittees to: (1) review applications made to the Director of the Institute for research projects relating to such diseases and make recommendations to the Advisory Council; and (2) review and evaluate programs directed at such diseases. Establishes within the Institute the position of Associate Director for Diabetes. Sets forth the duties of the Associate Director, including: (1) having primary responsibility for all diabetes-mellitus-related activities supported or conducted by the National Institutes of Health; (2) providing information to public and private agencies with respect to such activities; and (3) reporting and making recommendations to the Director of the National Institutes of Health with respect to other enumerated functions. Extends the authorization of appropriations for diabetes research and training centers in the following amounts: $14,000,000 for fiscal year 1981, $17,000,000 for fiscal year 1982, and $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1983 through 1985. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide from such amounts up to ten training stipends through each center in any fiscal year. Eliminates as an ex officio member of the National Diabetes Advisory Board the Secretary of Defense or his designee; and adds as such a member the Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development or his designee. Revises the terms of appointed members of the Board. Directs the Board to amend the Diabetes Plan (formulated by the National Commission on Diabetes under the National Diabetes Mellitus Research and Education Act) as is necessary to insure its continuing relevance. Extends the current level of authorizations for the purposes of the Board ($300,000 per fiscal year) through fiscal year 1985. Extends the expiration date of the Board from September 30, 1980, to September 30. 1985."
