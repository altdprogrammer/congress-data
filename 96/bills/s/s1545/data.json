    "text": "Accountability in Regulatory Rulemaking Act of 1979 - Authorizes the President to issue an Executive order directing any Federal agency, with specified exceptions, to consider, reconsider, or make a decision concerning the adoption of a rule if the President determines that such rule: (1) is important to the national interest; or (2) adversely affects a statutory goal which is at least equal to the goal of such rule. Allows the President to order the agency to reopen the record on such rule. Authorizes the President, after an agency has responded to an Executive order to act on a rule, to issue an Executive order modifying or reversing the rule. Stipulates that the President must comply with regulations governing rulemaking procedures of an agency when acting on a rule of such agency. States that the Executive orders issued under this Act are not subject to review in any court. Requires the President to: (1) publish a notice of such a proposed Executive order in the Federal Register for public comment; and (2) establish a docket file for each rule affected by such an Executive order. Directs the President to transmit a copy of such an Executive order to each House of Congress. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for consideration of a resolution to veto such an Executive order. Declares that a rule adopted by an agency pursuant to such an Executive order shall be subject to judicial review. Terminates the authority granted to the President by this Act four years after the date of enactment of this Act."
