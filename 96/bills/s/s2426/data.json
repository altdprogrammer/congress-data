Directs the Secretary to make available to producers for 60 days loans and purchases at specified levels for wheat and corn for both participants and nonparticipants in the Federal crop program. Entitles producers already carrying a price support loan on the 1979 crop to an additional price support loan. Limits the availability of emergency loans and purchases to producers who did not participate in the 1979 wheat or feed grain program to up to 50 percent of the wheat or corn produced in the 1979 crop year on the acreage normally planted to designated crops."
