    "text": "Federal-Aid Highway and Highway Revenue Act of 1980 - Title I: Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1980 - Amends the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 to decrease the authorization of appropriations for the Interstate Highway System for fiscal year 1983. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 and the Highway Safety Act of 1978 to increase and extend the authorization of appropriations for: (1) specified highways, parkways, roads, and trails; (2) bridge reconstruction and replacement; and (3) resurfacing of specified lanes and routes on the Interstate System. Sets forth the costs to be included by the Secretary of Transportation in making the revised estimate of the cost of completing the Interstate System. Prohibits the Secretary from approving any project which is to be paid for from funds apportioned for fiscal year 1983, or thereafter, if such project is not eligible for inclusion in such estimated cost. Directs that no State shall receive less than one half of one percent of the total apportionment for highway restoration and resurfacing. Adjusts the formula for the apportionment of Interstate System resurfacing funds. Provides for the reconstruction, as well as the resurfacing, restoring, and rehabilitating, of the Interstate System beginning in fiscal year 1983. Specifies the amount of funds available for emergency relief due to natural disasters or catastrophic failures. Limits to a specified amount obligations for projects resulting from a single disaster or catastrophic failure. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress, by July 1, 1981, an estimated cost of replacing or rehabilitating unsafe bridges (both on and off the Federal-aid systems) in each State. Directs that at least 30 percent of the apportionment to each State shall be expended for the construction of routes on the Interstate System which are not open to traffic. Extends through fiscal year 1983 the authorization of appropriations to encourage the use of car pools and van pools. Directs that specified amounts that any State receives for fiscal year 1983 shall not be less than the apportionments made to such State for fiscal year 1982. Limits to a specified sum the total of all obligations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations for the Federal-aid urban system. Specifies items to be included in bridge project costs. Title II: Highway Revenue Act of 1980 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code relating to the imposition of tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and specified motor fuels to direct that such tax be the greater of: (1) four percent of the applicable average wholesale price of gasoline; or (2) four cents per gallon.
