Requires Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting and reviewing Federal procurement specifications to revise such specifications according to dates specified by the Administrator to require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials (formerly reclaimed materials). Includes in the guidelines prepared by the Administrator, guidelines concerning performance and recommended minimum levels of recovered material content. Directs the Administrator to specify a date by which agencies will be required to comply with procurement requirements and specifications. Requires the Administrator to consider in the selection of items for guidelines: (1) the effect of Federal procurement of the item on the solid waste stream; and (2) the feasibility of using recovered materials in the item."
