Requires NASA to establish and implement a program to solicit and evaluate ideas from inventors and to stimulate the further development of specified ideas. Transfers to NASA within two years of enactment all automotive research and technology development activities currently being conducted by other Federal departments and agencies and so much of the positions, personnel, property, and funds of such departments and agencies as the Administrator of NASA shall recommend. Authorizes and directs the Administrator to prepare a comprehensive management program for the conduct of research and technology development activities under this Act, including a progress report on the transfer to NASA of the automotive research and development activities of other departments and agencies.
