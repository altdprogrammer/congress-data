    "as": "Passed Senate amended",

    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #172 (89-1)) Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to repeal the reporting requirement of the Hughes-Ryan Amendment of 1974, which conditions expenditures for Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) covert operations on the timely reporting by the President to the appropriate congressional committees. Retains the current requirement with respect to Presidential findings. Deems each covert operation a \"significant anticipated intelligence activity\" for the purposes of the new congressional oversight provisions established by this Act. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to add a new title V, \"Accountability for Intelligence Activities.\" Requires the Director of Central Intelligence and the heads of all Federal entities involved in intelligence activities to keep the congressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities, including any significant anticipated intelligence activity. Stipulates that this notice does not mean prior approval of such committees is required for initiation of intelligence activity. Permits such notice to be limited to designated Members if the President determines it is essential to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital U.S. interests. Requires the Director and heads of Federal entities to: (1) furnish information requested by the Select Committees on Intelligence; and (2) report in a timely fashion to such committees any illegal intelligence activity or significant intelligence failures. Directs the President to fully inform the Select Committees in a timely fashion of intelligence operation in foreign countries, other than those intended solely for obtaining intelligence, for which prior notice was not given . Requires the President and the Select Committees to establish procedures for carrying out these requirements. Directs the House of Representatives and the Senate, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, to establish procedures to protect classified and intelligence information from unauthorized disclosure."
