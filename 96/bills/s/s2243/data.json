    "text": "Amends the John F. Kennedy Center Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, to include repair services among the services necessary for the operation of the Center. Limits the Secretary's responsibility for utilities and maintenance to a specified percentage of the total costs. Exempts from the Secretary's responsibility for maintenance the theaters, other areas of the Center directly related to the production of performing arts attractions, and those areas occupied by third parties. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish services which are the responsibility of the Center's Board of Trustees, if the Board reimburses the Secretary for the costs of such services. Includes the Secretaries of the Interior and Treasury on such Board. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to forgive such Board from payment of interest on revenue bonds to finance the Center's parking facilities, if such Board repays the principal of such bonds pursuant to a prepayment schedule acceptable to the Secretary. Authorizes the Center to issue additional revenue bonds to retire the Center's debt to the concessionaire of its parking garage."
