Requires the taxpayer to elect whether to determine Btu content by volume or by weight. Limits application of such credit to pellets: (1) produced in a facility placed in service between January 1, 1980, and September 31, 1983, or for the construction of which the taxpayer was obligated under a binding contract on September 30, 1983; and (2) sold before January 1, 1990."
