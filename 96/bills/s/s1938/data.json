Sets forth the functions of such Council, including: (1) to advise the President on radiation matters affecting health and safety; (2) to review the authority of any Federal agency to regulate radiation-related activities; (3) to make recommendations to the President and Congress concerning changes in the authority granted to such agencies; (4) to identify the research needed by Federal agencies to meet their regulatory responsibilities, and to transmit to the Federal Conference on Research into the Biological Effects of Radiation (established by this Act), a list of such research needs; (5) to develop and recommend public education programs concerning radiation health and safety; (6) to review State and local radiation control programs; and (7) to keep the Congress and appropriate congressional committees advised as to the Council's activities. Directs the Chairman of the Council to establish, for at least one year, a Working Group on the Reduction and Control of Occupational Exposure to Radiation, to be composed of the heads of specified Federal agencies and one Council member. Requires such Working Group in consultation with concerned labor and management representatives and other qualified industries, to: (1) review the need for reduction or increased control of occupational exposure to radiation and suggest means for meeting any such needs, including specified reductions and improvements; and (2) study the feasibility of establishing a system for recording occupational doses of radiation received by individual workers and other occupational radiation information. Directs the Chairman to establish, for at least one year, a Working Group on Protection From Exposure to Medical Radiation, to be composed of the heads of specified Federal agencies and two Council members. Requires such Working Group to: (1) review the incidence of unnecessary patient to X-rays and suggest ways of reducing such unnecessary exposure; (2) suggest means to increase practitioner and patient awareness of the utility, limitations, and risks of diagnostic X-rays and of alternative diagnostic procedures; and (3) study the use of administrative controls and reimbursement incentives to reduce unnecessary exposure to medical X-rays. Provides for such Working Group to be assisted by an advisory group appointed by the Chairman and composed of seventeen people from specified professions and backgrounds. Directs such Working Group, within one year after its establishment, to report its activities and recommendations to the Council. Transfers to the Council all functions of the Environmental Protection Agency relating to radiation matters covered by the reorganization plan establishing the Environmental Protection Agency. Sets forth administrative provisions concerning the operation of the Council, including the authority to hold public hearings and to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of specified documents. Directs the Council to submit to the Congress annual reports and recommendations dealing with Federal radiation protection legislation.

Makes this title effective on October 1, 1981. =Title II: Federal Conference on Research into the Biological Effects of Radiation= - Establishes the Federal Conference on Research into the Biological Effects of Radiation to be composed of heads of specified Federal agencies and departments and two presidentially appointed public members. Sets forth the functions of such Conference, including: (1) to advise the President on Federal research activities concerning the biological effects of radiation; (2) to formulate an annual comprehensive Federal agenda for research into such effects; (3) to recommend to the President and Congress (a) uniform standards for Federal agency peer review of such research; (b) information dissemination procedures for informing the public, Federal agencies, and State and local governments of the results of such research; (c) guidelines for public oversight of such research; and (d) any needed transfer of research capability between Federal agencies; (4) to assist the Federal Council on Radiation Protection in developing public education program concerning radiation health and safety; and (5) to keep the Congress and appropriate congressional committees advised as to such Federal research activities. Permits the Conference to review Federal agency radiation research requests according to specified criteria to decide the scientific merit of such projects and whether they should be conducted by the agency or by an outside entity provided with financial assistance. Requires each Federal agency conducting or providing assistance for such research to conduct similar reviews. Sets forth administrative provisions concerning the operations of the Conference, including the authority to hold public hearings and to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of specified documents.
