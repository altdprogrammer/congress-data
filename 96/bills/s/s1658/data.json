    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1980-05-22", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Asbestos School Hazard Detection and Control Act of 1980 - States the purposes of this Act to be to: (1) establish a Federal task force to ascertain the extent of the danger from asbestos materials in schools to children or employees; (2) require States to establish programs for asbestos inspection in schools; (3) provide scientific and technical assistance to States and local school boards; (4) provide loans for the mitigation of serious asbestos hazards in schools; and (5) assure that no disciplinary action be taken against employees for calling attention to such hazards. Establishes the Asbestos Hazards School Safety Task Force. States that such Task Force's duties shall include: (1) compiling and disseminating medical, scientific, and technical materials to State and local entities; (2) reviewing and approving State applications for grants and loans; and (3) assisting in formulating standards and safety procedures. Requires State educational agencies which seek administrative funds to submit to the Secretary of Education a plan which: (1) describes the manner such State shall disseminate information on the health hazards of asbestos fibers; (2) describes the content of such information; and (3) describes the procedures to be used by the State in maintaining records on asbestos. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local educational agencies for the Federal share of the costs of carrying out an asbestos detection program meeting the standards of this Act. Prohibits the making of such grants unless an application has been submitted to and approved by the Secretary after consultation with the task force. Authorizes the Secretary to allocate up to 20 percent of such asbestos detection funds for use in education and technical assistance programs. Requires recipients of such asbestos detection funds to file a report with the Secretary describing detection and testing activities undertaken, the results, and the plan for correcting any discovered asbestos hazards. Establishes an Asbestos Hazards Control Loan Program in the Department of Education. Stipulates that loans from such program shall be: (1) available only to correct imminent asbestos hazards in schools to school children or school employees; (2) limited to projects covering more than 2,500 square feet; (3) for a period not exceeding 20 years; and (4) interest free. Requires applications for such loans to describe: (1) the nature of the asbestos problem; (2) the results of preliminary testing; and (3) the methods to be used to correct such problem. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate House and Senate committees regarding such loan program. Directs the Secretary to promulgate and distribute to the States safety standards and procedures for testing the level of asbestos in schools, for determining the likelihood of the leakage of asbestos into the school environment, and for determining which contractors are qualified to carry out testing and evaluation procedures. Stipulates that no employer receiving funds under this Act shall discharge or discriminate against any worker who focuses public attention on an asbestos problem in his or her school district. Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall restrict any other legal rights in connection with the purchase or installation of asbestos materials in schools, or with any claim of disability or death from exposure to asbestos in a school setting. Grants the United States a right of recovery for claims under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for programs established under this Act. Amends the Education of the Handicapped Act to increase the maximum amount, in certain circumstances, which may be used by a State for specified administrative costs connected with Federal assistance for the education of all handicapped children."
