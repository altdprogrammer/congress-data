Provides that, where a hospital has not entered into such an agreement and long- term care services are necessary, payment may be made for such services as if such an agreement were in effect, if the hospital: (1) has an occupancy rate below 80 percent; and (2) could obtain a certificate of need. Provides, under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act, coverage for skilled nursing facility services and intermediate care facility services furnished by a hospital which has in effect an agreement under title XVIII."
