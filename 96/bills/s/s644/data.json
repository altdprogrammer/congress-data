Empowers such Corporation to protect producers of agricultural products against loss of production cost due to unavoidable natural causes. Establishes in the Treasury of the United States the Agricultural Disaster Relief Fund, which the Corporation may charge to: (1) cover the part of claims in excess of premium income whenever such claims involve catastrophic production losses in an area; and (2) reimburse the Corporation for administrative and operating expenses, interest, and the direct costs of loss adjustments incurred in paying claims for catastrophic production losses."
