Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe: (1) special provisions applicable to persons 60 years of age or over and handicapped or disabled persons; and (2) minimum allotments after any reductions. Requires the Secretary to provide the appropriate congressional committees with a statement setting forth the basis of his belief and a description of the manner in which allotments will be reduced whenever he has reason to believe such reductions will be necessary."
