    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 96-685) =Title I: Domestic Violence= - Domestic Violence Prevention and Services Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (formerly, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare), to make grants to States, local, public agencies, and nonprofit organizations for projects designed to prevent domestic violence and to provide immediate shelter and other assistance for victims and dependents of victims of domestic violence. Stipulates that such funds may not be used for direct payment to any victim of domestic violence or to a dependent of such victim, and that no income eligibility standard may be imposed for anyone seeking services under this Act. Sets forth conditions for receiving the formula grants, including that the State: (1) distribute funds to local public agencies and private nonprofit organizations for domestic violence programs and services; (2) distribute at least two-thirds of such funds to private nonprofit organizations and give special emphasis to supporting community-based projects; (3) set forth procedures to assure an equitable distribution of grants within the State; (4) designate a State agency to administer the domestic violence program and coordinate all such programs within the State; (5) set forth procedures to assure active citizen participation within the State; (6) provide assurances that any project funded will coordinate its activities with other State programs and be administered by appropriately trained personnel; and (7) comply with reporting requirements. Provides that each State will be allotted at least $40,000 for such grants. Sets forth conditions for local public agencies and private nonprofit organizations to receive direct grants. Requires that at least 75 percent of the formula and direct grants be distributed to entities providing immediate shelter and related assistance to victims of domestic violence. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for: (1) administrative costs; (2) developing and implementing the application; and (3) assuring citizen participation. Provides that each State will be allotted at least $8,000 for such grants. Limits the total amount of grants to any local program to $150,000 for not more than a four year period. Limits the grant for any fiscal year to $50,000. Requires the Secretary, in reallotting funds, to give special consideration to applications from local public agencies and private nonprofit organizations in States not having a qualifying plan. Requires each State receiving assistance to report annually to the Secretary on the implementation of programs. Directs the Secretary to designate within the Office of the Secretary an administrative unit to serve as the National Center on Domestic Violence, to be responsible for: (1) the coordination (through the interagency council established by this Act) of all Federal programs relating to domestic violence; (2) the operation of a national clearinghouse to collect and disseminate information and statistics relating to domestic violence; (3) the development of a national media campaign to increase public awareness of the problems of domestic violence and the availability of services for its victims; and (4) keeping Congress informed with respect to the implementation of this Act. Requires that the records of any person subject to any program, project, or activity assisted under this Act be subject to confidentiality provisions modeled on those set forth in the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972. Directs the Secretary to make annual reports to Congress and to evaluate and report on the effectiveness of the programs no later than two years after funds are first obligated. Requires the Secretary to reserve from sums otherwise available from one to two percent of the sums appropriated under this title for the purpose of carrying out the evaluation activities. Establishes an Interagency Domestic Violence Council to assist the Director of the National Center in coordinating all Federal programs regarding the prevention of domestic violence. Directs the Secretary to report within 90 days of the end of fiscal year 1981 and of each subsequent fiscal year to certain congressional committees specific information relating to applications for assistance for domestic violence research. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1981, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1982, and $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1983 to carry out this Act. =Title II: Presidential Commission on National Service= - National Service Commission Act - Establishes a Presidential Commission on National Service to examine the need for and feasibility of a national service program to meet a broad range of human and societal needs. Requires the Commission to submit to Congress and the President interim reports and a final report within 15 months of enactment on its examination and legislative recommendations. Directs the President or an agency head designated by the President: (1) upon submission of such report, to ascertain the views of agencies affected by the Commission's recommendations; (2) to report to Congress on the feasibility and cost of implementing such recommendations; and (3) to submit a final report to Congress detailing the actions taken by executive agencies with respect to such recommendations. Terminates the Commission 180 days after the submission of its final report. Authorizes $750,000 for each of fiscal years 1981 and 1982 to carry out the provisions of this title."
