Requires such land to have been devoted to farming, woodland, or open space for the 60 months preceding the decedent's death. Provides for recapture of tax that would have been assessed and paid at fair market value if all or any part of such property is: (1) converted to an unqualified use; (2) rezoned for an unqualified use at the land owner's request; or (3) sold. Requires filing of a tax return within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which such a sale takes pace."
