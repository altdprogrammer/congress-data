    "text": "Small Business Motor Fuel Market Preservation Act of 1980 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make loans to small businesses acquiring gas stations from a refiner. Makes it unlawful for a refiner, other than an independent or small refiner, to operate a gas station in the United States. Requires a refiner, in disposing of any interest in such a station, to offer a right of first refusal to the dealer at such station. Sets forth the requirements for such an offer. Makes it unlawful for a refiner to sell motor fuel at any time at any point of transfer at different prices (except for price differentials which reflect manufacturing, sale, or delivery differences). Stipulates that a refiner shall: (1) be in violation of this Act if such refiner withholds available motor fuel from a purchaser and then resells such fuel at a lower price to refiner-operated stations; and (2) not be prevented from charging a uniform surcharge in connection with a sale of motor fuel as consideration for the purchaser's use of a refiner's trademark or other such identifying symbol. Makes it unlawful for any person to interfere in any way with the purchasing, selling, or storing of motor fuel by a dealer. Makes if unlawful for any dealer at a station displaying a trademark or identifying symbol of a particular refiner to sell motor fuel not refined by such refiner without providing notice to purchasers. Requires each refiner within 90 days of enactment to provide to the Federal Trade Commission information regarding the number of: (1) gallons of motor fuel sold, consigned, or distributed in each State during the preceding year; and (2) barrels of crude oil produced and refined during the preceding year. Requires persons owning 50 or more motor fuel stations in the United States to report specified information to the Commission. Sets forth fines for violation of this Act. Permits civil actions to be brought against violators of the requirements of the Act."
