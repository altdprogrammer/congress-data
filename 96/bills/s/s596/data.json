    "text": "Congressional Anti-Gerrymandering Act of 1979 - Specifies that each State entitled to more than one Representative in the 98th or any subsequent Congress shall establish a five-member redistricting commission. Directs such commission to establish a number of districts equal to the number of Representatives to which that State is entitled. Declares that no district shall differ by more than two percent from the quotient obtained by dividing the population of a State by the number of Representatives to which such State is entitled. Prohibits the drawing of district boundaries for the purpose of diluting the voting strength of any language minority group or of any racial minority group. Requires such commission to conduct public hearings with respect to the boundaries of districts and prepare and submit to the Federal Election Commission a plan for redistricting to be published in the Federal Register. Sets forth judicial procedures to insure compliance with this Act. Authorizes the Federal Election Commission to administer and distribute funds to each State for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act."
