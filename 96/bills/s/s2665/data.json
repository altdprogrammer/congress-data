    "text": "National Coal Production, Distribution, and Utilization Act of 1980 - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act of 1980 to designate coal as one of the minerals for which qualified applicants may acquire pipeline rights of way through Federal lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to determine whether construction of a coal pipeline would be in the national interest by considering the extent to which the pipeline: (1) would help meet national needs for coal; (2) would help displace imported petroleum and coal; (3) would increase competition and marketing opportunities for all coal producers; (4) would cost more if denied the power of eminent domain; (5) would affect the environment; and (6) would lower the cost of coal to consumers. Allows any person whose application for building a coal pipeline has been approved to acquire a right of way from a coal distributor by exercising the right of eminent domain in the proper State court or United States district court for the district in which the coal distributor's lands are located. Grants United States district courts jurisdiction only in cases where the owner of the land to be condemned claims more than $10,000 in damages."
