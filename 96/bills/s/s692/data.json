    "date": "1979-03-15", 
    "text": "Nurse Training Amendments of 1979 - Amends title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (Nurse Training) to redefine the purposes of the special projects for which the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is authorized to make grants to nursing schools and entities. Extends the authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1980 for such special projects and nurse practitioner programs. Eliminates the current requirement that nurse practitioners reside in health manpower shortage areas to participate in traineeship programs. Repeals the provision relating to loan agreements with nursing schools that prohibits a student who has attended such school before October 1, 1978, from receiving a loan from a fund established under the National Defense Education Act of 1958. Amends title VII of such Act ( Health Research and Teaching Facilities and Training of Professional Health Personnel) to eliminate the current requirement that certain percentage of the funds appropriated for National Health Service Corps scholarships be obligated for specified types of scholarships. Makes full-time students in graduate nursing degree programs eligible for health education assistance loans. Applies the current limitations on individual federally insured loans to such students."
