    "date": "1979-08-02", 
    "text": "Health Professions Training Amendments of 1979 - Amends title VII of the Public Health Service Act (Health Research and Teaching Facilities and Training of Professional Health Personnel) to authorize specified appropriations through fiscal year 1983 to the student loan insurance and interest payment fund to carry out the Federal program of insured loans and interest payments to graduate students in health professions schools. Eliminates as an eligibility requirement for participation in the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program that a student not be receiving funds from certain loans under programs assisted under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to pay to the holders of HEAL loans the total amount on the interest which accrues prior to the beginning of the repayment period (for a period of up to seven years). Eliminates the current financial need requirement with respect to Health Professions Student Loans, thus allowing the schools to determine the terms and conditions of such loans. Extends the repayment period for such loans from ten to 15 years. Authorizes the Secretary to make loan payments on behalf of individuals who serve in fields of health care determined to be lacking adequate professional manpower, in addition to designated health manpower shortage areas as currently provided. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such program through fiscal year 1983. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the exceptional need scholarship program through fiscal year 1983."
