Stipulates that the Court's determination in a prior case, setting the value of the land at 50 cents per acre, is binding on the parties in litigation brought under this Act. Directs the Court, if entitlement to such Tribe is determined, to compute any award on the basis of established judicial precedent and to compute interest at the rate of five percent per annum. Entitles the United States to an offset against any judgment entered under this Act of the sums awarded under the prior case. Makes provisions under the Indian Claims Commission Act relative to attorney's fees applicable to this Act."
