    "text": "Amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 to deny the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, for a three year period following the enactment of such Act, any licensing authority over byproduct material produced in any activity covered by an agreement under which a State has assumed authority over any such activity, unless such agreement is terminated. Grants the Commission authority over such activity if, upon expiration of the three-year interim, a State has not entered into an agreement concerning byproduct material producing activity within its boundaries. Reserves the right of the Commission and of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency notwithstanding any agreement giving a State authority over byproduct material producing activity, to take necessary action to protect public health and safety and the environment from radiological and nonradiological hazards associated with the processing, possession, transfer, or disposal of byproduct material."
