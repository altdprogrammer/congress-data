    "text": "Small Business Administrative Review Court Act - Establishes the Small Business Administrative Review Court, as an independent agency within the executive branch of the Government. Grants to the Court jurisdiction over small businesses challenging certain administrative orders, citations, and fines having a dollar value of $2,500 or less. Requires, for the Court to have jurisdiction, that a small business file a petition with the Court within 60 days of receiving notice of a fine, citation or order. Allows the Court to rescind or modify any such fine, citation, or order. Stipulates that a determination by the Court or a determination of lack of jurisdiction, may not be reviewed by any agency or court. Prohibits a small business concern that elects to have its case heard by the Court from pursuing agency review of the fine, citation or order until the Court renders a decision, or determines lack of jurisdiction. Permits a small business upon the Court's decision, or determination that it is without jurisdiction, to pursue agency review of the fine, citation, or order as if the petition had not been filed with the Court. Outlines the organization of the Court, its divisions, and its sessions. Describes the administration of the Court and the rules of procedure and service of process of the Court. Requires the chief judge of the Court to submit to the President and the Congress not later than four years after enactment a report including an assessment of the success of the Court in fulfilling its functions. Requires all fees received by the Court to be deposited into the Treasury. Makes this Act effective on January 1 of the year following the date of enactment. Makes the expiration date five years from the date of enactment."
