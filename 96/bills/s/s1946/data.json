Directs that such rate must be reasonable if the carrier has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies. Sets forth procedures to be used in determining whether such rate is reasonable. Prohibits such rates from being established below a reasonable minimum. Grants the Commission the authority to order such rates to be raised to the required minimum level. Directs that variable costs shall be determined under formulae or procedures prescribed or certified by the Commission. Sets forth standards and procedures to be used in determining whether a carrier has market dominance.

Authorizes a carrier to increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction so long as such rate is not greater than the adjusted base rate for the transportation involved, plus any rate increases implemented under this Act. Prohibits such rate increases from being found to exceed a reasonable maximum for the transportation involved. Authorizes a carrier, within specified time periods, to increase annually any rate by an additional six percent of the adjusted base rate.
