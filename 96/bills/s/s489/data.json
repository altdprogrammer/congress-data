Includes occupational therapy as a home health service. Permits a physician's assistant or nurse practitioner, who is supervised by a physician, to establish a plan of care for a home health patient living in a rural area. Eliminates prior hospitalization as a condition for receiving home health services. Requires home health aides to complete a training program developed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requires each home health agency to submit a bimonthly bill which lists all services provided each individual receiving services from such agency. Directs the Secretary to: (1) designate regional agencies to monitor home health agency costs; (2) establish guidelines to be used in determining the reasonable cost of home health services; (3) monitor the costs of home health services; (4) report to Congress on the frequency of use of home health services by individuals eligible for Medicare benefits; and (5) establish demonstration projects to test the effectiveness of agency or multiagency utilization review committees in ensuring the medical necessity, cost efficiency, and appropriate use of home health services."
