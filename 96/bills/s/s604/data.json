Requires the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, upon the request of a Federal agency, to determine the reasonable cost of preparing and filing such material. Authorizes civil actions to recover the difference between the amount determined by the Administrator and the actual cost of preparing and filing such material, including interest, attorneys' fees, court costs, and punitive damages."
