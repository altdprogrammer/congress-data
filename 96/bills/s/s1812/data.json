Excludes the following items and services from coverage under the Plan: (1) items and services needed solely to diagnose, treat, or aid in rehabilitation from disease, accident, or malformation in relation to teeth or structures directly supporting teeth, other than oral surgery in case of accident or malformation; (2) eyeglasses, eye examinations for the purpose of prescribing, fitting, or changing eyeglasses, and procedures performed to determine the refractive state of the eyes; (3) hearing aids or examinations for hearing aids, except for certain eligible individuals under 18; (4) personal comfort items that are not supplied to all patients of an entity or are not found to promote higher quality care; (5) cosmetic surgery, except as required for the prompt repair of accidental injury or for improvement of a malformed body member; (6) items and services furnished to an individual by an immediate relative or a member of the individual's household; (7) items and services for the treatment of flat foot conditions, the treatment of subluxations of the foot, or routine foot care; (8) surgery performed by an uncertified physician; (9) diagnostic tests for environmental or occupational diseases; (10) elective surgery; (11) items and services that a physician has not certified; (12) custodial care; and (13) items and services furnished by the Veterans' Administration to a disabled veteran for a military service-connected disability. Requires every employer to provide coverage under a qualified plan or under Healthcare for each employee family member, unless an individual is covered under a qualified plan or under Healthcare with another employer and chooses not to accept coverage. Requires every employer not providing coverage under Healthcare to employee family members in a geographic area to designate one qualified plan as the employer's primary plan in that geographic area. Requires every employer to offer a health benefit, whether or not part of a qualified plan, to each employee family member in a geographic area if the employer offers that health benefit to any other employee family member in that geographic area. Requires every employer to provide for the payment of required premiums on behalf of employee family members to the entity administering a qualified plan, or, to the Secretary if coverage is under Healthcare. Prohibits an employer requiring any employee covered under the employer's primary plan or under Healthcare from contributing more than 25 percent of the premium payments for his or her family members attributable to the minimum benefits required by a plan under this Act. Provides that the employer's total share of premium or other payments for health benefits provided to an employee's family in a geographic area shall be equal to the employer's share of premium payments under the primary plan or Healthcare for a family of the same size and composition in that geographic area. Requires a plan, in order to be certified by the Secretary as qualified, to, among other things: (1) be administered by an entity certified by the Secretary; (2) cover at a minimum the items and services covered by the National Health Plan; (3) provide for rates of payment under the plan for items and services such that the rates in the aggregate insure access to items and services; (4) provide a certain level of quality of items and services; (5) provide specified rates of payment; and (6) prohibit total coinsurance and deductibles for items and services covered by the National Health Plan for the family members of any employee from exceeding $2,500 subject to certain adjustments and stipulations. Provides that services prescribed by a health maintenance organization (HMO) shall be considered a qualified plan. Directs the Secretary to certify an entity as a plan administrator only if it meets specified criteria pertaining to: (1) the privacy of medical records; (2) the availability of certain information concerning the plan; (3) access to records; (4) grievance procedures; (5) the purchase of additional insurance; (6) premiums; (7) solvency; and (8) control of the entity.

Sets forth civil penalties for employers who fail to provide coverage and make premium payments as required by this Act. Entitles the following individuals to Healthcare: (1) individuals age 65 or older who are entitled to benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act or are qualified to receive railroad retirement benefits; (2) disabled individuals entitled to benefits under title II or the Railroad Retirement Act; (3) every individual who is fully or currently insured under title II or the Railroad Retirement Act or is the spouse or dependent child of such individual and certain individuals who have end stage renal disease (ESRD); (4) kidney donors; (5) family members of U.S. citizens and aliens admitted for permanent residence; (6) individuals covered by a Healthcare employer agreement; (7) individuals and family members of individuals who are at or below 55 percent of the poverty level, as reduced according to this Act; (8) individuals eligible under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act whose income, reduced as provided for in this Act, does not exceed specified levels; and (9) individuals eligible for assistance under titles I (Old-Age and Medical Assistance), X (Aid to the Blind), XIV (Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled), IV (part A, Aid to Families with Dependent Children), or XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Act and who are residents of States which, if eligible, participate in Medicaid.

Provides a rate for each class equal to 95 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost for that class.

Authorizes the Secretary to waive compliance with the requirements of titles X, XVIII, and XIX of the Act to the extent necessary to conduct specified experiments or demonstration projects. Provides for the transfer of funds in the Medicare trust funds to the Healthcare Trust Fund. Title II: Health System Reform - Amends title XV (National Health Planning and Development) of the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to annually set a national limit for certificates and reports of need to be issued for major increases in hospital capital stock. Sets the limit at $3,000,000,000 to be increased to reflect a rise in construction prices and adjusted further to reflect population changes. Defines a \"major increase in hospital capital stock\" as the establishment of a new hospital or an acquisition or improvement by an existing hospital that exceeds $150,000 in value, would increase the number of short term non-federal hospital beds, or would substantially change institutional health services offered. Stipulates that a certificate of need authorizing new short term non-federal hospital beds in a health service area where the number of such beds per 1,000 persons in the area exceeds the bed limit for that area may only be issued if two existing beds would be eliminated for each new bed established. Requires a certificate of need authorizing a major increase in hospital capital stock to specify the maximum dollar amount authorized. Prohibits the total value of such certificates issued in a State from exceeding the State's total allocation from the national limit, with certain adjustments. Permits exceptions to meet an emergency situation or if needed to assist in serving individuals from other States. Amends part A of title XI (General Provisions) of the Social Security Act to increase by a factor of ten the reduction in Federal payments under titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Act for an increase in health care facility capital stock or a change in health care facility bed function made without an appropriate certificate of need. Directs the Secretary to allocate to each State a maximum dollar amount for: (1) all major increases in hospital stock in the State; (2) increases that will not result in an increase in the number of short term non-federal hospital beds; and (3) for other increases."
