Requires approval by the appropriate congressional committees before constructing, acquiring, leasing, altering, or acquiring by exchange public buildings if the costs exceed $500,000. Requires the Administrator to transmit to Congress a prospectus of the proposed facility. Requires approval by the appropriate congressional committees before the Administrator may: (1) increase expenditures by more than ten percent or (2) decrease the number of gross square feet to be constructed by more than ten percent. Directs the Administrator to submit annual reports to the appropriate congressional committees concerning: (1) long-range plans for the acquisition, modernization, and use of space; and (2) an inventory of real property owned by, and leased to, the United States. Provides for the financing of the acquisition or construction of public buildings through the issuance of public debt obligations. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the use of funds deposited in a Treasury account for real property management for payment of such debt obligations. Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1949 to authorize the Administrator to name public buildings not already designated by statute. Prohibits designating any public building after any individual."
