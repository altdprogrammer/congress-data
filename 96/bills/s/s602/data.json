Increases the amount of expenses which may be considered in determining the amount of the credit. Provides that the earned income limitation shall not apply to taxpayers who provide care for handicapped children. Grants tax-exempt status to a trust established for the care of a physically or mentally handicapped child of the taxpayer. Allows an income tax deduction for contributions to a child care trust. Limits the amount of such deduction to the lesser of 15 percent of the taxpayer's compensation includable in gross income for the taxable year, or $1,500. Provides that distributions from such a trust shall not be taken into consideration in determining the eligibility of such child for Federal or State assistance."
