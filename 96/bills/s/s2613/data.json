Directs the Committee to take specified measures culminating with: (1) the establishment of uniform policies and procedures for interagency sharing of health resources by Federal direct health care providers; and (2) the promulgation, within 120 days after enactment of this Act, of guidelines for the interagency sharing of medical resources by health care facilities within the jurisdiction of the Secretaries and the Administrator. Requires that such guidelines provide that: (1) shared services shall not be limited to specialized medical resources; (2) the availability of a medical facility of one agency to a beneficiary of another agency shall be on a referral basis; (3) an agency shall be reimbursed for a medical service provided to a beneficiary of another agency; and (4) sharing agreements shall be operative upon agreement by medical facility directors unless disapproved by an agency involved. Requires each agency providing medical services under this Act to report annually to Congress concerning such services. Directs the General Accounting Office to monitor and report annually to Congress on the progress of the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Veterans' Administration in implementing this Act."
