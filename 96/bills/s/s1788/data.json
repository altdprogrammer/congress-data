Directs the President to appoint to the Board one additional officer from a Federal agency and a small business proprietor, as defined in the Small Business Act, who is a manufacturer or retailer. Exempts such small business appointee from provisions of law which require the presidentially appointed members of the Board to resign in favor of Directors selected by the shareholder cooperatives as the equity of the Federal Government in the Bank is redeemed. Revises the schedule for the resignation of the presidentially appointed Directors as the capital of the bank is paid-in."
