Establishes a civil penalty for the failure to comply with such notification requirement, to be assessed and enforced according to specified procedures. Directs the Secretary to make available upon request any information submitted under this Act, except for trade secret and commercial information which is currently exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Requires the Secretary to notify a person submitting information of a determination that such information is non-exempt. Authorizes the Secretary to release any information if such release is necessary to protect against an imminent hazard to the public or environment. Directs the Secretary to submit annually to specified congressional committees reports relating to the implementation of this Act."
