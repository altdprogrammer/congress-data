Defines such expenditures as any amount paid or incurred to establish or maintain a wind erosion control and wildlife habitat area (or shelterbelt) on any United States land held by the taxpayer and used in a trade or business of producing crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock. Limits such credit to the amount of the tax imposed, reduced by the sum of other specified allowable credits."
