    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with amendments) Authorizes appropriations for the acquisition of the Tinicum National Environmental Center, for construction of environmental educational center facilities, and for other development projects on the Center, to remain available until September 30, 1985. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation and cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service, to investigate potential environmental hazards resulting from the Folcroft landfill within the boundary of such Center, and to make recommendations thereon. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, during any period in which vehicular access to Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge is limited by regulation, to issue to eligible applicants (including all full-time residents of specified areas on North Carolina) a renewable annual permit to commute across such Refuge. Authorizes the Refuge Manager to allow additional access relating to health or livelihood to qualified permittees. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage, until the completion of a required study, Sailors' Snug Harbor as a National Wildlife Refuge, if: (1) such property is donated by the City of New York to the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary, the City, and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, Incorporated, enter into mutually satisfactory cooperative agreements. Directs such parties to endeavor to enter into such agreements under specified terms and conditions. Directs the Secretary to complete, within two years, a study to determine how such resources and facilities could best be protected and managed under other available statutory authorities. Directs the Secretary, upon completion of such study, to either place such property permanently in the National Wildlife Refuge System or transfer its management to a more appropriate agency of the Department of Interior. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for fiscal years 1981 through 1983."
