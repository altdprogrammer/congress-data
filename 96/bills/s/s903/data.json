    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, provisions inserted in H.R. 3875 as passed House) Amends the National Housing Act to extend until September 30, 1981, the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the national insurance development program. Authorizes the Secretary to continue certain reinsurance and direct insurance until September 30, 1984. Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to extend until September 30, 1981, the flood insurance program. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1980 an amount not to exceed $74,000,000 for flood insurance studies required to establish actuarial premium rates for the regular flood insurance program. Amends the Urban Property Protection and Reinsurance Act of 1968 to transfer the position of the Federal Insurance Administrator from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in consultation with the Appalachian Regional Commission, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and other appropriate agencies, to carry out a study which: (1) identifies political jurisdictions which have a significant population and degree of economic development within special flood hazard areas but limited alternate sites for construction and development; and (2) assesses the impact of the national flood insurance program on property values, the tax base, and economic activities in such jurisdictions. Directs that such study be submitted to the Congress with recommendations for alternative means for meeting the problems it identifies including technical assistance, subsidized interest rate loans, and the development of alternate building sites."
