    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to make price support available, beginning with the 1979 crops of wheat and feed grains, to producers who participate in a specified producer storage program, at increased levels of at least $3.50 per bushel for wheat and $2.50 per bushel for corn. Provides that such increased levels shall not be used for making specified determinations. Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to raise the limit on a secured storage facility construction or remodeling loan from $50,000 to $100,000. Deletes the requirement that the size of such facilities for which such loans are obtained be based on estimated production quantities."
