Directs Federal agencies to consider the retention of agricultural land for agricultural purposes when they make decisions which impact directly or indirectly on private, and State and local government public land, as well as on Federal land. Requires all such Federal agencies to review their administrative procedures, especially those regarding land acquisition and management, in order to bring them into conformity with the policies and purposes of this title. Title II: Farmland Review Study - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study: (1) agricultural land in the United States; (2) the effects of industrial development, climate, and other factors on the productivity of such land; (3) the acquisition of such land by persons not engaged in agricultural activities; and (4) methods of protecting and improving such land, and of reducing the amount being converted to nonagricultural uses. Requires a final report of findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the President and to Congress within 42 months after the effective date of this Act. Title III: Research Program - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, during a three-year period, to provide financial and technical assistance to States and local governments for the development, demonstration, and testing of methods of reducing the quantity of agricultural land (including such land in and around urban areas) being converted from agricultural uses to nonagricultural uses. Limits such financial assistance to not more than 25 percent of the cost of preparing, establishing, demonstrating, conducting, and testing three such reduction projects. Title IV: Technical Assistance Program - Directs the Secretary, through the Soil Conservation Service, to provide State and local governments with: (1) technical assistance concerning methods of protecting agricultural land and reducing its conversion to nonagricultural uses; and (2) financial assistance (not to exceed 25 percent of costs) to enable such governments to develop plans to implement such methods. Title V: General Provisions - Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1980 through 1983."
