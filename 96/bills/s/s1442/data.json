Directs that the vessel Sara be granted such privileges only so long as it is owned by a citizen of the United States and is operated for a nonprofit purpose. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to procure and install national defense features on specified United States merchant ships. Directs the Secretary to submit the plans and specifications for such national defense features to the Navy Department for approval. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to certify approval of such plans to the Secretary of commerce. Grants to vessels engaged in the coastwise transportation of domestic coal from one United States port to another, priority to load at such ports before vessels engaged in exporting coal. Authorizes the Secretary to eliminate such priority loading and to report such action to Congress within 30 days. Allows the vessel Scuba King to be documented to engage in the fisheries and coastwise trade so long as it is owned by a citizen of the United States."
