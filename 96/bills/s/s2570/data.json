    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-04-16", 
    "text": "Emergency Motor Fuel Demand Rationing Act of 1980 - Amends the Emergency Energy Conservation Act of 1979 to authorize the President to require payment to the Secretary of the Treasury by each person engaged in the production or importation of motor fuel of an emergency motor fuel rationing fee, which shall remain in effect as specified in this Act, to be levied on each gallon of fuel produced or imported into the United States. Stipulates that such fee may only be put into effect if: (1) there is a severe interruption of the energy supply, or it is necessary for the United States to comply with obligations under the international energy program; (2) the President has transmitted to Congress information to that effect; and (3) neither House of Congress disapproves. Authorizes the President to make the fee effective without regard to the above if: (1) the President has transmitted to Congress a request to waive the requirements in accordance with the provisions of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act which provides an expedited procedure for energy conservation contingency plans; and (2) Congress approves the request within 30 days. Sets forth guidelines for determining the fee, including: (1) the need to restrain consumption; (2) the need to maintain orderly commerce in refined petroleum products in the U.S.; (3) the need to moderate the effect of the consumption of motor fuel in the U.S. on world petroleum markets and on the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products in such markets; and (4) the need to capture and return to end use that portion of the price of fuel, which without the fee, would result in revenue in excess of the unavoidable cost of producing or importing the fuel. Defines \"severe energy supply interruption\" as a national energy supply shortage which: (1) results in or will result in a daily shortfall in the U.S. of gasoline, diesel fuel, and No. 2 heating oil for a period in excess of 30 days of an amount equal to 20 percent or more of projected daily demand; (2) is not manageable under other energy emergency authorities; (3) is expected to last for a period of time such that the adequacy of domestic gasoline, diesel fuel, and No. 2 heating oil stocks will be seriously threatened; and (4) is having or could have a major adverse impact on the national health, safety, or economy. Establishes the Emergency Motor Fuel Rationing Trust Fund in the United States Treasury to consist of the fee imposed by this Act less those amounts disbursed as rebates. Entitles to a rebate each individual entitled to assignment of rights, and evidence of such rights, entitling such individual to obtain motor fuel in precedence to others under the rationing contingency plan in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Provides that such individuals shall receive rebates in the form of reduced income tax withholding, increased supplemental security income payments; increased veteran's benefits or other methods."
