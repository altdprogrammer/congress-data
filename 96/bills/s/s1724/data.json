Rept. 96-378) Home Energy Assistance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to make grants to States to assist eligible low-income households to meet increasing home energy costs. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 through 1982 to carry out this Act. Extends such authorization one year automatically, unless Congress takes contrary action. Specifies the formula to be used in determining allotments to each State of the authorized appropriations. Reserves specified amounts for: (1) energy crisis related activities under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964; (2) U.S. territories and possessions; and (3) home energy assistance programs. Permits the reallocation of State allocations. Provides for direct grants to Indian tribes by the Secretary, if the Secretary determines that the tribes would thereby be better served. Permits home energy grants to be used for home energy assistance in accordance with approved State plans. Sets forth procedures for and requirements of such State plans. Authorizes States to make grants to eligible households for meeting excessive cooling costs where such cooling is medically necessary under standards established by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria and standards for State plan requirements, together with timetables for carrying out such plans. Requires States to comply with the uniform data collection standards established by the Secretary concerning home energy consumption, cost and type of fuels used, use by which income groups, and other information determined to be necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold payments under this Act for failure to comply with approved application provisions. Sets forth criminal penalties for violations of this Act or the knowing provision of false information. Sets forth provisions for the administration of this Act. Stipulates that payments received by members of participating households are not to be considered income for determining eligibility for other Federal assistance programs. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with specified Federal officials, to establish procedures for referrals for participation in Federal weatherization programs. Requires the Director of the Community Services Administration to reserve allotments for each State, according to a specified formula, from sums appropriated by this Act or available pursuant to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 for fiscal year 1980.
