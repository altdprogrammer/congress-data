    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Department of Energy National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act of 1981 - =Title I: National Security Programs= - Authorizes the appropriation of funds for fiscal year 1981 to the Department of Energy for operating expenses and plant and capital equipment costs incurred in carrying out national security programs, including scientific research and development, strategic and critical materials necessary for common defense, and military applications of nuclear energy, as specified. =Title II: General Provisions= - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of authorized funds for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of, Congress unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to all the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement as specified. Imposes specified limits on the costs of general plant projects and construction projects. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Federal agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for proposed construction projects with amounts authorized for plant engineering and design, and to perform such services using available funds for any Department of Energy defense activity construction project in the event of any national emergency. Prohibits the use of any funds available under this or any other Act from being used: (1) for the licensing of any defense activity or facility of the Department of Energy by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; or (2) to pay any penalty, fine, forfeiture, or settlement resulting from a failure to comply with the Clean Air Act with respect to any defense activity of the Department of Energy if either compliance is impossible or the President has specifically requested appropriations for compliance and Congress has failed to appropriate the funds. Requires the Secretary to: (1) produce and stockpile the nuclear materials and the warhead components necessary to enable the rapid conversion of certain warheads to an enhanced radiation capability; and (2) develop a plan for a cooperative program to provide assistance in the stabilization and management of certain uranium mill tailings."
