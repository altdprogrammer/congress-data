    "as": "Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment, 2nd occurrence",

    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations through fiscal year 1982 to carry out the provisions of such Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to end the dumping of industrial waste into ocean waters. Provides that after December 31, 1981, the Administrator may issue permits for the ocean dumping of industrial waste upon determination that such proposed dumping: (1) is necessary for research purposes; (2) will have minimal adverse impact upon human health, welfare, or amenities and the marine environment; or (3) will provide potential benefits outweighing any such adverse impact. States that such permits shall be effective for no more than six months. Authorizes the Administrator to impose conditions and restrictions on permits to minimize possible adverse impacts of such dumping. Authorizes the Administrator to issue emergency permits for the dumping of industrial wastes into ocean waters, or other specified waters, after December 31, 1981. Requires, for such issuance, that the Administrator determine that there exists an emergency which poses an unacceptable risk to human health and admits of no feasible solution except the dumping of such waste. Defines \"sewage sludge\", for specified purposes of such Act, as any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated by a municipal wastewater treatment plant the ocean dumping of which may unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities. Defines \"industrial waste\" as any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated by a manufacturer or processing plant which, if dumped in the ocean, may degrade or endanger human health or welfare or the marine environment. Makes provisions of such Act concerning foreign-state ocean-dumping permits applicable to transportation of material by an agency or instrumentality of the United States, with a proviso that the Administrator must concur in the filing of an application for such permit. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct a study to assist the City of New York in evaluating the technological options available for the removal of heavy metals and other toxic organic materials from the sewage of the City of New York. Requires that such study be completed by July 1, 1981."
