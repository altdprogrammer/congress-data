Makes such revisions effective upon: (1) the tender of a conveyance to the United States, including lease or easement, by the State of Minnesota of the lands to be added to the park; (2) the establishment of a wildlife management area by the State in a specified area to be deleted from the park; and (3) agreement by the State to manage State lands riparian to Black Bay to preserve the natural character of the area. Authorizes the Secretary to convey all right, title, and interest of specified lands deleted from the park to the State of Minnesota at such time as the boundary revisions become effective. Authorizes a specified sum to be appropriated for the acquisition of lands under this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report specific recommendations to the appropriate congressional committees, within six months of enactment of this Act, relative to existing road access to the park."
