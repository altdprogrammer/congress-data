Specifies the amount of such credit to be an amount equal to the sum of: (1) ten percent of the first $10,000 of such taxpayer's adjusted basis; plus (2) five percent of any other amount of such adjusted basis. Limits such credit to $3,000 annually ($6,000 in the case of a married individual filing a joint return)."
