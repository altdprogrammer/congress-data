Sets such ten-year period to run from the date of completion of such compliance, construction, or modification, or during the period of depreciation or amortization of such facility for Internal Revenue Code purposes, whichever period ends first. Exempts from the application of this Act any source to which a substantial imminent threat to public health can be attributed, as determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency."
