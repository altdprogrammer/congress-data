Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act to repeal, effective February 28, 1981, the provisions of such Act which establish salary levels for certain committee staff positions and which authorize the Committee on Rules and Administration to hire an additional staff member. Eliminates the annual stationery allowance for all standing committees of the Senate. Continues such allowance for the officers of the Senate and the Conference of the Majority and of the Minority of the Senate."
