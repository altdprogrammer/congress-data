Repeals the authority of the President to adjust such rates of pay annually. Directs the President to submit recommended adjustments to Congress. States that such rates of pay shall be adjusted only if a joint resolution of Congress specifying the amount and effective dates of such adjustments is enacted. Prohibits any pay increase for Members of Congress which is proposed during a Congress from taking effect before the first day of the next Congress. Prohibits any increase in the rates of pay for the Vice President, Members of Congress, Executive Schedule employees, and specified officials of congressional agencies unless Congress has approved a second concurrent resolution on the budget in which the total budget outlays do not exceed Federal revenues for the fiscal year in which such increase is to take effect."
