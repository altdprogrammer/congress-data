Revises the forfeiture provision to subject monetary instruments to seizure only if the person required to file a report knowingly fails to do so. Authorizes any customs officer who has reasonable cause to suspect that monetary instruments are being transported for which a report is required to search any vehicle, vessel, aircraft, envelope or other container, or person entering or departing from the United States, without a search warrant. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay a reward to any individual providing original information which leads to a recovery of at least $50,000 by way of a criminal fine, civil penalty, or forfeiture for a violation of such Act. Makes ineligible for such payment any Federal, State, or local government employee who furnishes information in the performance of official duties."
