R. 3580) Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 - Amends the Rural Development Act of 1972 to establish the Working Group for Rural Development, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, and composed of Assistant Secretary-level representatives of specified departments and agencies, which shall develop and recommend comprehensive strategies to: (1) maximize the effectiveness, increase the responsiveness, and improve the delivery of Federal programs to rural areas; (2) increase coordination of such programs with the development needs, objectives, and resources of local communities, substate areas, states, and multistate regions; and (3) achieve the most effective combinations of Federal, State, and local resources to meet the needs of rural areas for orderly growth and development. Specifies: (1) the objectives of such strategies, including that they cover a four-year period and contain budgetary recommendations; and (2) time limits for the submission of such strategies to Congress. Directs the Working Group to determine whether Federal programs affecting rural areas are equitable in comparison to urban programs. Sets forth attendant duties of such Group, including: (1) holding appropriate hearings; (2) reviewing regulations affecting rural areas; (3) establishing, with assistance from the Secretary, offices of rural development within particular Federal departments and agencies; and (4) reporting annually to Congress on the implementation of the strategies. Directs the President to appoint a Rural Development Advisory Committee, representing State and local governments, farmers, rural residents, and other organizations, to assist the Working Group. Extends the authorization of appropriations for rural development and small farm research and extension programs through fiscal year 1981. Stipulates that the plan and budget required under the rural development and small farm research and extension programs, in States containing more than one institution accepting the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and/or 1890 (including Tuskegee Institute), shall be jointly developed by the chief administrative officers of all such institutions. Extends coverage of the Act to Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. Directs the Secretary to guarantee loans up to $180,000,000 to public and private, profit and nonprofit organizations and individuals for pilot projects for the production of alcohol fuels from agricultural commodities and forest products. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to promote research and development efforts related to appropriate technology for small and moderate-sized family farms and any other problem affecting rural areas. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to increase from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 the maximum annual aggregate amount of rural development grants. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1970 to eliminate certain reporting requirements by the President and the Secretaries of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development."
