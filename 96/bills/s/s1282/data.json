    "text": "Hazardous Waste Emergency Cleanup Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program for the cleanup of any hazardous waste disposal site that poses an imminent threat to human health or safety if the owner of such site is unable or unwilling to properly carry out such a cleanup, or cannot be found. Requires such a program to include all measures necessary to remove any imminent threat to human health or safety, including removal of hazardous wastes to proper treatment, storage, or disposal facilities meeting the standards determined under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Directs the Administrator to make funds available to any State which has an equivalent or more thorough program, in lieu of carrying out the Federal program in such State. Requires the Administrator to pursue any remedy available for the recovery of amounts expended under this Act from any person who may be liable for payment of the costs so incurred. Requires any State receiving funds for its cleanup program to repay the Administrator a pro rata share of any amounts it similarly recovers. Reserves $65,000,000 of Agency appropriations for fiscal year 1980 for such cleanup program."
