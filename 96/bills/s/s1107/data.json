    "text": "Youth Opportunity Wage Act of 1979 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to allow employers to employ youths between 16 and 20 years of age, without prior or special certification by the Secretary of Labor, at 85 percent of the minimum wage (or the applicable wage in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) for 180 days, with the exception of youths employed by an employer at the minimum wage before the enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to insure against violations of such provisions. Prohibits employers from engaging in a pattern and practice of: (1) substituting younger workers employed at less than the minimum wage for older workers employed at or above the minimum wage; or (2) terminating the employment of some youths and employing other youths in order to gain continual advantage from the youth opportunity wage. Establishes rates of compensation and fines for such violations. Eliminates special subminimum wage provisions for full-time students."
