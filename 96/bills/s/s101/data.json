    "text": "Religious Freedom in the Workplace Act of 1979 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act to provide that any employee who is a member of a religion or sect historically holding conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting a labor organization shall not be required to do so. Allows such employee to be required in an employment contract to pay sums in lieu of and equal to dues and initiation fees to a nonreligious, nonlabor, charitable organization which is consistent with the employees belief. Permits the charitable payment to be deducted through an established dues checkoff procedure. Requires such employee who uses the grievance-arbitration procedure to reimburse the employee organization for the reasonable costs of such procedure."
