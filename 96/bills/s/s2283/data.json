Allows separate exclusions to married individuals who are both working overseas, although one's excess exclusion cannot be used against income earned by the other. Allows an exclusion from gross income for housing allowances or housing expenses which exceed 20 percent of earned income (determined without regard to such allowance). Repeals current provisions of the Code allowing tax deductions to such persons for certain living expenses abroad."
