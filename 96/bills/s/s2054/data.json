Directs regional solar energy centers, in conjunction with the National Solar Energy Research Institute, to act as clearinghouses for information regarding solar access. Requires each department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States engaged in constructing or maintaining any structure to do so in a manner which is consistent, to the extent practicable, with State and local laws governing access to sunlight."
