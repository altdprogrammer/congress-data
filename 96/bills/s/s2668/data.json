Requires the Secretary of Energy to pay an annual fee to such importers. Authorizes the Secretary to permit such importers to remove amounts of crude oil on the commencement of distribution under the plan contained in the implemented Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan. Requires the Secretary to pay importers (less the amount of the fee already paid) for crude oil distributed from the contributed amounts."
