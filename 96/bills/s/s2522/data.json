Reduces the limitation on the amount of such exclusion from $100,000 ($50,000 in the case of a married individual filing separately) to the excess of such dollar figure over the amount of gain excluded for any preceding taxable year. Applies such reduced limitation only with respect to excluded gain attributable to sales or exchanges after July 27, 1978."
