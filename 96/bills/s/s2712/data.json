Requires a grievance to be filed within eight months after the occurrence giving rise to the grievance or the discovery of grounds for the grievance. Sets forth procedures to be followed by the board in considering the validity of a grievance. Sets forth the rights of grievants. Makes the board's recommendations final and binding on all the parties, unless the Secretary determines that U.S. foreign policy or security will be adversely affected. Requires the grievant to elect between pursuing relief under this Act or under any other relief provisions. Authorizes judicial review of any regulations or actions of the Secretary or the board pursuant to this Act."
