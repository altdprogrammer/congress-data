Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop and publish guidelines to provide that State conservation plans result in the conservation of fish and wildlife and their habitat. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to approve any such plans or actions which are substantial in character and design unless implementation would threaten the natural stability or continued viability of any animals concerned. Makes States eligible for matching funds under the existing fish and wildlife restoration programs if their plans are approved by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to reimburse eligible States for costs incurred in connection with conservation plans and actions. States that nothing in this Act shall affect: (1) State regulation of fish and wildlife; (2) the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to control predatory or wild animals; and (3) State requirements that acquisitions be from willing sellers. Directs the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to study the most equitable and effective mechanism for funding projects under this Act and submit the results and recommendations to the appropriate congressional committees."
