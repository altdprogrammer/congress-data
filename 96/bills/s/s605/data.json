    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-03-08", 
    "text": "Food and Nutrition Program Optional Consolidation and Reorganization Act of 1979 - Provides the States with the option of consolidating and reorganizing the following food assistance programs: (1) the food stamp program of the Food Stamp Act of 1964; (2) the child feeding programs of the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; (3) the food and nutrition education program of the Smith-Lever Act; and (4) the commodity supplemental food program. Allows any State to participate in the consolidation program, and guarantees that a participating State shall receive the funds it would otherwise have received under the above-mentioned programs. Stipulates the procedure by which a State may withdraw from the program. Permits a State to receive a planning grant of up to two percent of the amount that State presently receives under the four existing programs, in order to prepare a consolidated plan conforming to this Act. Sets forth requirements for receiving such a grant. Requires each State desiring to receive funds for the consolidation program to: (1) designate a State agency to ascertain the food and nutrition needs of the State's needy population, to formulate and monitor the State consolidation plan and to receive and apportion State and Federal funds earmarked for the program; (2) publish, prior to consolidated assistance and every fourth year thereafter, a four-year comprehensive State plan which conforms to the requirements of this Act, and update the plan annually; (3) certify to the Secretary of Agriculture that the requirements of (2) have been complied with; and (4) provide for an annual audit of expenditures, and to report the findings of that audit to the Secretary. Provides that a State participating in a consolidated program is eligible to receive an additional grant for carrying out that program equal to 10 percent of its total entitlement, provided that such amount is matched by the State with an equal amount of non-Federal funds. Requires the Secretary to furnish the same services-in-kind which would have been furnished to the State had the State not participated in the consolidated program. Permits the States to purchase food-service equipment and facilities with funds made available under this Act. Forbids any State from using more than 2 1/2 percent of the funds made available under this Act for administrative expenses. Provides for evaluations and monitoring of the program authorized under this Act. Requires the Secretary to carry out a program of grants to States which consolidate under this Act for purposes of interstate cooperation. Provides for the participation of children enrolled in private of Indian tribal schools if a State is prohibited by law from providing for their participation. Imposes criminal penalties on anyone who embezzles, steals, or fraudulently obtains any funds authorized by this Act."
