    "text": "Home Heating Oil Supply Protection Act of 1979 - Declares the policy of the Congress that refined petroleum products, including home heating oil, should be produced, distributed, and marketed in the manner most beneficial to consumers. Prohibits petroleum refiners and distributors from terminating or failing to renew any marketing relationship with retailers or other distributors and prohibits such refiners and distributors from reducing the allocated supply of such refined petroleum products in the relevant geographic market area except in accordance with specified provisions which require prior notification of such termination, nonrenewal, or reduction in supply. Authorizes retailers or distributors to maintain civil actions in the appropriate United States district court against refiners or distributors engaging in such conduct. States that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to create immunity from civil or criminal liability or defenses to actions under the antitrust laws for any individual, corporation, or other business organization."
