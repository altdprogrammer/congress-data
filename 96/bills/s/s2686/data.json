    "text": "(Reported jointly to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 96-975) Declares that Federal policy shall be to minimize threat to human lives, damage to ecological resources, and wasteful expenditures of Federal funds, by limiting Federal assistance and permits which facilitate development of Barrier Islands. Specifies that the provisions of this Act shall apply to those undeveloped barrier islands, barrier spits, and barrier beaches and portions thereof (referred to as barrier islands) which when taken together comprise the \"Barrier Islands Protections Systems\". Prohibits, on any such barrier island, any Federal expenditures or financial assistance from being made available under any authority of Federal law, and any Federal license, permit, or other form of approval from being issued by any Federal agency for: (1) the construction of any structure, facility, road, or related infrastructure; (2) any road, bridge, airport, boat landing facility, or other facility to be used for providing access to any area in the Barrier Islands Protection System; (3) flood insurance policies under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 for structures in which construction had not commenced prior to May 8, 1980; and (4) any project to prevent the erosion of, or to otherwise stabilize, any shoreline or inshore area of such a barrier island. Declares that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to: (1) activities directly related to energy development and production; (2) navigational safety and aids; (3) expenditures of funds under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965; or (4) the replacement, reconstruction, or repair of any structure, facility, road, or related infrastructure existing prior to May 8, 1980, where such replacement, reconstruction, or repair is consistent with Federal hazard mitigation policies. Specifies that only permits, consistent with the policies established by this Act, may be issued pursuant to the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act of 1977 to an individual for reasonable noncommercial use of such individual's property, or for an activity whose primary purpose is not related to the affected barrier islands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make minor boundary revisions in the areas included as part of the Barrier Island Protection System. Declares that nothing in this Act is intended to supersede the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, or regulations established pursuant to such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to accept donations of lands or interest in lands located on any barrier island in the United States."
