    "text": "National Agricultural Security Act of 1980 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make available loans and purchases and participation in the producer storage program on up to 50 percent of the corn produced in the 1979 crop year by any producer who did not file a timely agreement to participate in the 1979 feed grain set-aside program. Permits the Commodity Credit Corporation to sell its stock of corn at less than 150 percent of the current level of price support if such corn is used in the production of alcohol for motor fuel at facilities meeting specified requirements. Amends the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 to stipulate that the reduction of acreage normally planted to designated commodities required by the Secretary for eligibility for price supports shall not apply to the 1979 crop of soybeans. Directs the President to establish a reserve stock of wheat to provide emergency food assistance to developing countries when domestic supplies are limited. Declares that such reserve stocks shall not be considered a part of the total domestic supply and shall not be subject to specified export limitations. Amends the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 to raise the limit on a secured storage facility construction or remodeling loan from $50,000 to $100,000. Amends the Emergency Agricultural Credit Adjustment Act of 1978 to raise the ceiling on the total principal balance which may be outstanding from $4,000,000,000 t0 $6,000,000,000. Extends the authority to make contracts of insurance or guarantee under such Act until September 30, 1981. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, with the U.S. Trade Representative, to study and report to the President and Congress on the potential for expanding U.S. agricultural export markets and the use of agricultural exports to obtain needed natural resources or other products. Sets forth items to be included in such study. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation to purchase the agricultural products which were intended for export to the Soviet Union."
