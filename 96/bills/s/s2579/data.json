Makes technical and conforming amendments in such Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to remove from any such grants made after March 1, 1973, and prior to the date of enactment of this Act, any condition or requirement no longer applicable as a result of such repeal or to release any grant recipient from such obligations. Amends the Clean Water Act of 1977 to make technical and conforming amendments related to such repeal of industrial cost recovery provisions. Declares that the amendments made by this Act shall take effect on December 27, 1977."
