Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to permit the President to transfer up to $30,000,000 of the funds available for other foreign assistance programs to the international disaster assistance program for humanitarian assistance to Cambodia. Amends the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975 to delete the percentage limitations on the amount of assistance authorized to be provided to Indochina refugees. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish humanitarian assistance to Cambodia. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Permits obligations already incurred to be charged against such authorized appropriations. Stipulates that nothing shall be interpreted as recognizing any group claiming to be the Government of Cambodia. Requires all funds for such assistance to be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, through international agencies and private voluntary organizations. Directs the President to report to Congress on the estimated total costs to the Federal, State, and local governments for refugee assistance."
