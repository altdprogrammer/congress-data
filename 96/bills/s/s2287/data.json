Specifies that lands within the National Forest System which have been recommended in the 96th Congress for designation as wilderness, or identified for further planning, but have not been included in the National Wilderness Preservation System prior to January 1, 1982, shall be managed beginning on such date for uses other than wilderness. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, upon receipt of any communication from the Idaho State Legislature recommending additions to or deletions from the wilderness system in Idaho, to conduct a study pursuant to such recommendations and report within two years to Congress the merits of such proposed additions or deletions."
