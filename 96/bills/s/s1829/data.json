    "text": "Community Energy Efficiency Act of 1979 - Provides grants to cities and counties for basic planning, advanced planning, and capital investment related to energy conservation, renewable resource utilization, and other energy-related community programs. Requires that an application for a basic community energy action planning grant include plans for implementing the following programs: (1) a conservation and alternative energy information program; (2) a program designed to reach locally-established targets for energy conservation and renewable resource development; (3) a neighborhood energy conservation and production activity program; (4) a program to assist low-income residents in taking energy conservation and renewable resource measures; (5) a program to integrate such measures with those at the metropolitan or areawide level; (6) a program to amend local land use controls, transportation controls, and policies and ordinances so as to facilitate conservation and renewable resource development; and (7) a program to coordinate local energy activities with State and Federal programs and policies. States that a recipient of such grant may apply for grants for advanced planning for community energy action program development after making significant progress in implementing the programs described above. Requires that an application for such development grant include plans for implementing the following programs: (1) plans for adoption of a renewable resource ordinance providing access and facilitating the use of such energy sources; (2) adoption of residential and commercial property conservation standards; (3) a program to displace nonrenewable resource consumption; and (4) development of a capital energy plan utilizing Federal and State energy-efficiency projects. Requires recipients of such grants to make grants available to neighborhood organizations for special energy projects. Authorizes cities and counties reaching the advanced planning stage to apply for capital investment grants for investment in conservation and renewable resource technologies appropriate to individual communities. Establishes a Local Energy Reference Center as a data bank and clearinghouse for information on locally-based energy conservation and renewable energy resource development efforts. Directs the Center to establish regional Technical Assistance Panels to provide assistance for local energy program development. Provides documentation and distribution grants to local governments for the preparation and distribution of publications on energy conservation and renewable energy resources. Requires States to provide eligible grant recipients with a description of applicable State energy programs and policies, identifying areas of local responsibility. Directs the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development and Energy to issue specified regulations and to monitor the progress of recipients of grants awarded under this Act. Directs them to convene an interagency task force to improve existing Federal policies and programs in order to promote the purposes of this Act and to report to Congress on the operation and the energy impact of the programs established under this Act."
