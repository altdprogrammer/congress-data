    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable income tax credit equal to ten percent of the purchase price of common stock regularly traded on an established market which is purchased by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Limits the amount of such credit to $100 ($200 in the case of a joint return). Requires the taxpayer to hold such stock for at least 36 months after its purchase, or else pay a tax penalty in the year of sale of 150 percent of the amount allowed as a credit for the purchase of such stock. Exempts from such holding requirements stock which is sold on account of the death of any individual holding an interest therein, or on account of a property settlement in a divorce proceeding. Disallows the credit with respect to the sale of stock between related parties."
