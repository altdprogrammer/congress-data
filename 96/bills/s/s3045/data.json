    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Boston African American National Historic Site in Boston, Massachusetts. Authorizes the Secretary to accept any gift or bequest of any property within the boundaries of such site and to enter into cooperative agreements with the city of Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or any of their political subdivisions, or any private person or organization for such activities as may be necessary for the preservation of any such properties. Authorizes the Secretary to assist with maintenance of those properties owned by the city of Boston, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, their political subdivisions, or not-for-profit organizations. Specifies that if any fees are charged for the use of a property covered by any such cooperative agreement, and Federal funds are committed in the cooperative agreement, the income from such fees shall be applied to the costs of maintenance and renovation of such property. Prohibits any Federal fees from being charged for entrance or admission to the historic site. Permits the Secretary, in cooperation with other interested groups, to identify other significant sites relating to the nineteenth century free African American Community on Beacon Hill, Boston, and, with the consent of the owners thereof, mark them appropriately and make reference to them in any interpretive literature. Directs the Secretary, within three complete fiscal years from the effective date of this Act, to submit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive general management plan for the historic site. Specifies that authority to enter into contracts to incur obligations or to make payments under this Act shall be effective only to the extent, and in such amounts, as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts."
