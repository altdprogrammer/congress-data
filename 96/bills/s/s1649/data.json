    "text": "Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1979 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the rate of tax imposed on fuel used in noncommercial aviation. Imposes a six percent tax on retail sales of such fuel used by an owner, lessee, or other operator of an aircraft (repealing the current seven cents per gallon tax). Reduces the airline ticket tax for individual travel from eight to two percent. Increases the tax rate for individual travel to five percent after September 30, 1990, and terminates such tax for the transportation of property by air after such date. Revises the tax on the use of civil aircraft for the period beginning on July 1, 1990, and ending on September 30, 1990. Amends the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to extend the authorization of such tax levels and the life of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund from October 1, 1980, through October 1, 1990."
