    "text": "Supplemental Security Income Amendments of 1979 - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to increase the amount of income an individual may receive and still qualify for SSI benefits. Increases the amount of SSI benefits payable. Increases SSI benefit payments to institutionalized individuals. Eliminates the benefit reduction for an SSI recipient living in the household of another person who receives support and maintenance in kind from such person. Excludes from the income of an individual, for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility, the cost of attendant care services and medical devices necessary to enable a severely disabled individual to work. States that a disabled individual by reason of his or her earnings shall not be considered able to engage in substantial gainful activity, for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI benefits unless such earnings exceed the level at which the portion not excluded under title XVI equals the benefit that would be payable under title XVI if such individual had no income of any kind. Increases the SSI emergency payment made on the basis of presumptive disability from $100 to the full SSI payment. Authorizes reductions in State SSI supplementary payments."
