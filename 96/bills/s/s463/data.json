    "text": "International Sugar Stabilization Act of 1979 - Title I: International Sugar Agreement - Authorizes the President to implement the International Sugar Agreement by (1) regulating the entry of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization, and (2) requiring records and reports concerning the entry of sugar. Establishes criminal penalties for violating such regulations. Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual report on the Agreement beginning in 1980. Title II: Domestic Sugar Program Provisions - Establishes 17 cents per pound, raw value, as the price objective for domestic sugar during the 1978 sugar supply year. Sets forth the formula for determining the price objective for succeeding years. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor the average daily price of sugar imports. Directs the Secretary to recommend that the President impose special import duties and quotas on sugar and sugar-containing products to assure that the average daily price of sugar imports will meet the proclaimed price objective for sugar. Requires the Secretary to review the imposed duties and quotas and recommend any adjustments to the President. Authorizes the President to impose special import duties or quotas after receiving any recommendation of the Secretary within certain time limitations. Prohibits the importation of direct-consumption sugar unless a national emergency is proclaimed because of an imminent shortage of such sugar due to lack of refining capacity. Prohibits the importation of more than 100 pounds of sugar annually into the Virgin Islands. Prohibits the exportation of certain sugar. Establishes penalties for violations of such regulations. Exempts certain sugar or sugar-containing products from this title. Specifies that certain sugar entered for subsequent export shall not be charged against any proclaimed quota. Authorizes the President to suspend the operation of this title in a national emergency. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to permit the President to proclaim special import duties and quotas on sugars, syrups, and molasses in order to carry out this Act. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Vests jurisdiction for enforcing this Act in U.S. district courts. Requires all persons engaged in manufacturing, marketing, transporting, or industrial use of sugar and other sweeteners to furnish the Secretary with necessary information. Prohibits officials engaged in the administration of this Act from investing or speculating in sugar. Establishes penalties for violating these regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct surveys and investigations to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies on the costs of producing various sugar and sweetener products. Extends the current price support programs for sugar beets and sugarcane through the 1981 crops. Authorizes the Secretary to waive part of the interest and/or principal to encourage repayment of Commodity Credit Corporation loans with respect to the 1977 and 1978 crops of sugar beets and sugarcane. Terminates this Act, except for Title I and the provisions authorizing the President to impose duties and quotas, on September 30, 1982."
