    "text": "Community Home Health Services Act of 1980 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove the 100 visit limitation presently applicable to home health care services under such title. Eliminates prior hospitalization as a condition of eligibility for home health care services under part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) of such title. Eliminates the $60 deductible for home health services. Includes occupational therapy as a home health service. Requires a home health aide to complete an approved training program successfully. Expands the definition of home health service to include any professional health service or item provided in an individual's home by a hospital or by hospital staff as an alternative to institutional care, if such services are not otherwise qualified for Medicare payment, excluding any item not included as an inpatient hospital service. Revises the definition of a home health agency to: (1) require an agency to meet such requirements as the Secretary of Health and Human Services finds necessary for the effective and efficient operation of Medicare; and (2) remove the restriction barring a profitmaking agency unless licensed pursuant to State law. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act to provide coverage for home health services."
