    "text": "Title I: Interest Rate Amendments Regarding State Usury Ceilings on Certain Loans - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the National Housing Act, the Federal Credit Union Act, and the Small Business Investment Act to permit State insured banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and small business investment companies to charge interest at one percent in excess of the discount rate in effect in their Federal Reserve districts notwithstanding lower State usury ceilings. Penalizes the charging of interest in excess of such rate by forfeiture of the creditor's entire interest in the indebtedness. Title II: Applicability of State Usury Ceilings to Certain Obligations Issued by Banks and Affiliates - Amends the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, and the Federal Credit Union Act to preclude specified financial institutions from pleading or claiming with respect to any deposit or obligation of such institution any defense or right under any State law regulating interest rates. Suspends any penalty which would attach under any such State law. Title III: Applicability - States that the provisions of this Act shall apply to any loan or obligation entered into after its enactment unless a State enacts overriding legislation. Stipulates that the amendments made by this Act not supercede provisions of law relating to business and agricultural loans of $25,000 or more."
