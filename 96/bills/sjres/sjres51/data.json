Authorizes Congress to prescribe elector qualifications for electors in the District of Columbia. Continues electoral vote allotments to States and the District of Columbia. Directs the official custodian of the election returns of each State, within 45 days after the election, to make lists of all persons for whom votes were cast, number of votes cast, and the total vote cast by the voters. Requires that each person for whom votes were cast in each State receive such proportion of the electoral votes as he received of the total vote cast in such State. Declares the person receiving the greatest aggregate number of electoral votes, if at least 40 percent of the total, to be President. Requires in case of a tie or no one receiving 40 percent or more of the votes, that the Senate and House of Representatives choose, by ballot, the President and Vice President from the two persons receiving the greatest numbers of such votes. Repeals provisions of the Constitution relating to the Electoral College. Sets forth the effective date of this article as the first day of February following ratification."
