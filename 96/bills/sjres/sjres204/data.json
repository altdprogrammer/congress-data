    "text": "American Federalism Rejuvenation and Renaissance Resolution of 1980 - Directs the President, after consulting with Congress, to call a Convocation on American Federalism by January 1, 1981, in order to bring together elected officials of Federal, State, and local governments to stimulate a national assessment of the Federal system of government. Enumerates the duties of the Convocation which include: (1) defining which governmental functions are inherently national in nature and which functions are inherently State or local in nature; (2) examining the allocation of such functions; (3) identifying any necessary changes in the current functional or programmatic roles of each level of government; (4) defining the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce and the use of such power to preempt State and local regulatory authority; (5) defining the limits on the power of Congress to attach conditions to the distribution of Federal financial assistance; and (6) developing strategies to simplify the Federal grant system and to ensure that the system is utilized only where direct provision of the services by the Government would not be effective. Requires the Convocation to adjourn by January 1, 1982, and to publish a final report by May 1, 1982. Permits Convocation delegates to conduct State and regional conferences to prepare for the Convocation. Authorizes the Chairman of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to provide financial assistance for such conferences. Directs the Chairman to plan and administer the Convocation until the delegates elect a Convocation Chairman."
