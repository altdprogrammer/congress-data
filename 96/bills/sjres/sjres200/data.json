Prohibits the United States or any State from establishing, or permitting any private individual or enterprise from establishing, quotas which make distinctions on account of race, color, or national origin. Prohibits the United States or any State from making any law which prohibits any person without intent to discriminate on account of race, color, or national origin, from taking otherwise lawful actions which have a disproportionate impact on persons on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Prohibits any Federal or State court from issuing any order which makes distinctions on account of race, color, or national origin (except to enforce laws in violation of this article)."
