    "text": "Supreme Court Jurisdiction Act of 1979 - Limits the circumstances under which parties have a right to appeal cases to the United States Supreme Court. Leaves unaffected provisions in current law establishing Supreme Court review by writ of certiorari or by certification of questions of law by the appropriate courts. Eliminates from current law: (1) the provision authorizing a party to appeal to the Supreme Court a decision invalidating an Act of Congress; (2) the provision authorizing a party to appeal to the Supreme Court by relying on a State statute which has been held by a court of appeals to be invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States; (3) the provisions authorizing the review by the Supreme Court of final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be made, where (A) the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question and the decision is against its validity, or (B) the validity of a State statute is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity; (4) the provision under the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 allowing a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of any decision on a matter certified to a court of appeals under such Act; (5) the provision establishing the right of either the Indians of California or the United States to appeal to the Supreme Court claims against the Government for appropriated lands; and (6) the provision under the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act allowing direct review to the Supreme Court of certain constitutional claims."
