Establishes the International Conservation Grant Panel composed of persons knowledgeable about wildlife issues and at least one specialist on international trade in fish, wildlife, and plants. Authorizes the Panel to award grants to assist foreign nations in developing comprehensive projects for the conservation of fish, wildlife, plants or their habitats. Sets forth factors to be taken into consideration by the Panel in awarding such grants. Requires the Panel to consult with the Secretaries of the Interior and State. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with the foreign recipients of such grants concerning the conditions and limitations of such grants. Establishes the International Wildlife Fund in the U.S. Treasury to be used for carrying out this Act. States that the Fund shall consist of appropriated sums and any gifts of money. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on the administration of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund equal to the revenues resulting from the additional duty on wildlife products."
