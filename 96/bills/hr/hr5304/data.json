    "text": "Energy Productivity Act of 1979 - Title I: Residential Energy Conservation - Establishes the Residential Energy Conservation Office within the Department of Energy to accept applications for reimbursement of residential energy conservation improvement expenditures made in accordance with regulations issued by the Director of such office. Sets forth requirements for such applications and imposes limitations upon the amount of reimbursement to be made to approved applicants for energy conservation improvements to houses, apartment buildings, and hotels. Directs the Director to coordinate such reimbursement program with the energy audit program established under the National Energy Conservation Act and to promote the availability of such audits in connection with such reimbursement program. Authorizes the Director to use any available means of communication to advertise such residential energy conservation reimbursement program. Requires the Director to conduct an evaluation of such program to determine its effectiveness in promoting residential energy conservation and its cost effectiveness in terms of probable energy savings. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to audit the operations of the Residential Energy Conservation Office. Sets forth procedures for such audits. Authorizes appropriations for such residential energy conservation program. Requires sellers of energy conservation improvements to certify to purchasers that such improvements comply with regulations issued by the Director pursuant to this Act. Establishes criminal penalties for providing false information to the Director concerning any reimbursement application or improvement certification. Title II: Industrial Fuel Conservation - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to make loans to industrial firms to assist in paying engineering costs for industrial energy conservation projects. Sets forth criteria for issuing necessary regulations and terms and conditions for such loans. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal years 1980 through 1985. Authorizes appropriations for an accelerated energy productivity industrial research, development, and demonstration program. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations providing for an energy rebate to industrial firms implementing energy conservation projects approved by the Secretary. Sets the amount of such rebate at $15 for each barrel of crude oil equivalent of critical fuel saved in the full year following such project implementation. Requires that such rebate be structured to provide incentive for investment in permanent conservation equipment and production procedures. Authorizes appropriations for such rebate program. Title III: Commercial Property Energy Conservation Loan Program - Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Energy a Commercial Property Energy Conservation Loan Program for the purpose of providing low-interest loans to owners, developers, or builders of commercial property for the purchase of energy conservation systems. Prohibits participation of Program personnel and agents in matters affecting their personal interest or the interests of any entity with which they are associated. Directs the General Accounting Office to periodically audit the financial transactions of the program. Establishes an advisory board to provide advice to the Secretary in carrying out such loan program. Sets forth membership requirements for such Board. Excludes owners, developers, or builders of structures eligible for grants pursuant to title III of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act from eligibility for such loans. Defines the term \"energy conservation systems\" for the purpose of determining eligibility for such loans and sets forth terms thereof. Provides that where a borrower has entered into agreements with his tenants allowing energy savings passthroughs, such borrower may pass through annual loan payments to his tenants as operating energy expenses. Establishes criminal penalties for making false statements or misrepresentations concerning loans made under such program. Directs the Secretary to make annual reports to the President and to both Houses of Congress on the operation of such program, recommendations for improvements, and identification of problem areas. Directs the Secretary to promote such loan program by informing financial institutions and commercial property owners, developers, and builders of the benefits of such program. Permits the use of Department of Energy personnel on such program. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal years 1980 through 1983."
