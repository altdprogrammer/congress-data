    "text": "Municipal Arts Program Act of 1980 - Authorizes the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, with the advice of the National Council on the Arts, to make grants to cities and metropolitan areas to help finance municipal arts programs approved under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1985. Limits the total amount of any grant to one-third of the costs of such municipal arts program. Exempts 15 percent of the funds available to the Chairman from this restriction. Directs the Chairman to submit to Congress timely requests for additional authorizations for fiscal years 1986 through 1989. Sets forth requirements for applications for grants, including summaries of projected uses of such funds, general sources of revenue, and assurances of citizen participation in the planning process of such program. Limits the percentage of funds which may be expended for planning and administration purposes. Directs the Chairman to approve an application unless the activities fall clearly outside the purposes of this Act. Sets forth the activities eligible for assistance under a municipal arts program. Requires grants to cities and metropolitan areas with populations of less than 500,000 to be reviewed by the State agency except as specified. States that an application will be deemed approved unless disapproved. Sets forth the formula for the allocation and distribution of funds for annual grants. Creates a discretionary fund for each of the fiscal years in an amount equal to ten percent of authorizations for grants to be used by the Chairman in making grants for specified purposes, including special studies service centers and clearinghouses. Authorizes the Chairman to make grants up to 100 percent of the costs of such programs. Directs the Chairman to report to the President and Congress within three years on the progress of the municipal arts program."
