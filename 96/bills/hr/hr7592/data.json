    "text": "(House receded and concurred in certain Senate amendments with amendment) Military Construction Appropriation Act, 1981 - Makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for military construction for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense agencies, Army National Guard, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and reserve components generally. Sets forth the amount of funds available to each department to be used for activities related to the conversion of facilities to alternative fuels. Makes appropriations for expenses of family housing for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Defense agencies, and for the United States' share of costs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Sets forth limitations on the use of funds appropriated by this Act, including limitations on funds for the installation of solar energy systems, space transportation system facilities, and the MX missile system. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to transfer or move chemical or gas weapons into MX impacted areas. Prohibits the use of such funds to compensate any alien who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States. Limits expenditures for consulting services through procurement contracts to those contracts which are a matter of public record and available for public inspection. Declares that any funds appropriated to a military department or defense agency for construction of military projects may be obligated at any time before the end of the fourth fiscal year after the fiscal year such funds were appropriated, under certain conditions. Limits spending to 30 percent of the total budget, or 15 percent for any month, for the last quarter of fiscal year 1981. Directs the head of each such department and establishment to report to the Congressional committees on Appropriations and to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) not later than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, on the obligations incurred during such quarter. Requires the Director of OMB to report to such committees and the Comptroller General by December 31, 1981, on his oversight findings of spending by military departments. Directs the Comptroller General to submit an analysis of such report and recommendations pursuant thereto to such committees. Directs Federal agencies to take immediate action toward improving collection of overdue debts, billing interest on delinquent debts, and reducing the amounts of such debts written off as uncollectible. Requires each Federal agency, beginning in fiscal year 1982, to submit annually to the Congressional Appropriations Committees, as part of its budget justification, the estimated amount of funds requested for consulting services and a description of the need for such services. Directs the Inspector General of each agency, or comparable official, to submit with the budget justification, an evaluation of the agency's progress toward effective management controls and improvements in accuracy and completeness of data provided to the Federal Procurement Data System regarding consulting service contracts. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated under this Act: (1) for the purchase of foreign steel for construction of shelters or bases of the proposed MX missile system; (2) for dredging in the Indian Ocean by foreign contractors; (3) to pay real property taxes in any foreign nation; or (4) to construct a Naval medical center in San Diego, California, unless the United States has fee title interests."
