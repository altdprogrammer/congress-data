Exempts residential property, residential rental property, and low-income housing from the requirement that construction period interest and taxes related to such property be amortized instead of deducted currently. Expands eligibility for accelerated depreciation of rehabilitation expenditures for all types of rental housing, not just low-income rental housing. Increases the amount of depreciable rental housing rehabilitation expenditures to $30,000."
