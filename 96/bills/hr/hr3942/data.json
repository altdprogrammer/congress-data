    "as": "Reported to House amended, Part II", 
    "date": "1979-07-13", 
    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce with amendment, H. Rept. 96-203 (Part II)) Aviation Safety and Noise Reduction Act - =Title I:= Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a single system of measuring noise and the impact of noise on individuals at airports and their surrounding areas and to establish land uses for such areas which are compatible with such noise levels. Allows airport operators to submit noise impact maps to the Secretary of Transportation setting forth the noncompatible uses in each area of the map, a description of the projected aircraft operations during 1985, and the ways in which such operations will affect such map. Requires the revision of such maps when changes in airport operations would create any new noncompatible use in areas surrounding an airport. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to authorize the Secretary to make grants to qualified airports for noise compatibility planning. Defines \"noise compatibility planning\" as the preparation of noise impact maps and noise compatibility programs under this Act. Sets forth limitations regarding the amounts which may be obligated through such grant program. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1980 and thereafter to carry out such grant program. Stipulates that noise compatibility programs be filed with the Secretary. Sets forth factors under which the Secretary may approve or disapprove noise compatibility programs. Stipulates that the Federal share of an approved program shall be 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes the Secretary to obligate up to $100,000,000 out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for fiscal year 1980 to carry out approved noise compatibility programs. Requires the Secretary to prepare noise impact maps and noise compatibility programs for specified airports near the District of Columbia. Permits such maps to be used in court proceedings if the airport operator is not making a good faith effort to implement such plan. Limits suits for damages resulting from airport noise by individuals acquiring property in an area surrounding an airport for which a noise impact map has been submitted and the individual has been furnished a copy of such map. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the effectiveness of airport noise compatibility planning and programs which were funded pursuant to this Act. =Title II:= Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to stipulate that the Federal share for airport system planning or for airport master planning projects shall be 100 percent of the costs of such a project if: (1) the area involved is a coastal island having a population between 1,500 and 25,000; (2) the island is separated from the coast by approximately 20 miles; and (3) the island is located within a standard consolidated statistical area which has a population of 5,000,000 or more and which has one or more major hub airports within such area. Increases the authorization for appropriations for airport and airway development programs for air carrier airports, and general aviation airports. Repeals restrictions under such Act which prohibit 1980 fiscal year funding of discretionary programs for air carrier and general aviation airports. Authorizes appropriations for air navigation facilities for fiscal year 1980. Stipulates that in the event the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fails to obligate the maximum amount made available for obligation for such facilities, the amount which the FAA may spend for operations and maintenance from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund shall be equivalently reduced. Increases discretionary funds specifically allocated to reliever airports. Increases the Federal share for specified airport development projects. Prohibits the Secretary from approving any project involving the construction or extension of any runway at a general aviation airport which is located astride a line separating two counties within a single State if, before the submission of such project to the Secretary, the project has not been approved by the governing body of any incorporated village located within five miles of such airport. Directs the Secretary to construct an airport control tower at a specified location, and authorizes appropriations from the Trust Fund for such construction. Directs the Secretary: (1) to obligate the funds necessary to complete all pending airport development projects at Bandette International Airport, Bandette, Minnesota, Floyd W. Jones-Lebanon, Missouri Airport, Lebanon, Missouri, and Greenville Municipal Airport, Greenville, Alabama; (2) to install a full instrument landing system at Detroit Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti, Michigan; (3) to obligate funds necessary for the construction of a new runway at Slidell Airport, Slidell, Louisiana, and (4) to carry out research projects, in coordination with the EPA Administrator, on the health implications of aviation noise. Authorizes appropriations from the Trust Fund for such purposes. =Title III:= Directs the Secretary by May 1, 1980, to require all aircraft to comply with specified noise standards if, by January 1, 1980, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) does not adopt specified noise standards. Stipulates that if the ICAO adopts such standards, the Secretary shall issue a rule requiring all aircraft which do not meet such standards to do so at a phased rate of compliance. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress: (1) on the need to cease the issuance of certificates for civil subsonic, turbojet aircraft above a specified takeoff weight, if such aircraft do not meet specified noise standards; and (2) if there is such a need, when this requirement should be imposed. Sets forth the components of such study. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring newly manufactured aircraft to comply with specified noise standards for a certain period. Requires Congressional approval of rules or regulations imposing more stringent noise standards after such period has elapsed. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt from such noise standards two-engined aircraft exclusively servicing points within the State of Hawaii. Authorizes any air carrier to operate non-complying two-or three-engine aircraft if: (1) such aircraft operate primarily at airports with a specified maximum percentage of the total enplaned passengers enplaned by all air carriers certificated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAS); and (2) the Secretary determines that such exemption will not have an adverse effect on health or the environment. Prohibits such aircraft from operating at larger airports except in case of emergency. Requires air carriers operating such non-complying aircraft to report regularly to the Secretary in order to determine the applicability of the above requirements to such air carrier. Provides that for ten years beginning on January 1, 1981, no rule, regulation, or order may be used as the basis for amending, modifying, suspending or revoking an aircraft's airworthiness certificate, except for safety, health, or environmental reasons. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Chairman of the CAB, to review the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 to study the definition of essential air transportation under such Act and to consider the problem of reduced air transportation service in specified areas. Requires the Secretary to recommend solutions to any such problems to the Congress. Limits the liability of State and local airport proprietors under Title III of this Act to the liability which they would have incurred prior to enactment of this Act. =Title IV:= Directs the Secretary to submit annual reports to the Congress on the implementation of collision avoidance systems in the national air traffic control system. =Title V:= Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit the Secretary or the Administrator of the FAA from issuing rules or regulations: (1) designating new terminal control areas unless the primary airport in such areas enplane at least one percent of the total persons enplaned in the United States in a 12 month period; (2) raising the maximum altitude of any previously designated terminal control area; (3) designating any area as a terminal radar service area unless in accordance with specified criteria; (4) requiring aircraft operating within a specified altitude range to operate under positive control; and (5) modifying the aircraft national speed limit in effect on December 26, 1978, for operations below a specified altitude."
