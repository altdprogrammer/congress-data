    "text": "Alternate Energy Commercialization Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an alternate energy systems grant program for fiscal years 1981 through 1984 which will provide for the adoption of alternate energy systems by individual and small business energy consumers. States that such grants shall be made to State agencies which meet the eligibility requirements set forth in this Act. Sets forth allocation requirements for and limitations on the amount of such grants. Provides that a State agency shall be eligible to receive such grants if it establishes a program of making grants to individuals and small businesses for expenses incurred for the purchase and installation of an alternate energy system. Sets forth specified warranty requirements with respect to the purchase of such energy systems with such grants. Defines \"alternate energy system\" to mean a modification in, or addition to, a residence or place of business which transmits or uses solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, biomass processes, or any other form of renewable energy for heating, cooling, or hot water purposes. Authorizes appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 1981 through 1984."
