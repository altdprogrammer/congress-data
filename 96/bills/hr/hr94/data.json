States that such prohibition shall not apply if the Secretaries determine, and publish in the Federal Register, that a food preservative is commercially available: (1) which may be used in the place of nitrites; (2) which is effective in the protection of public health from botulism and other forms of food poisoning; and (3) the use of which is economically feasible for meat processors and the consumer. Requires the Secretaries to conduct or support, by grant or contract, research and development activities for a food preservative alternative to nitrites."
