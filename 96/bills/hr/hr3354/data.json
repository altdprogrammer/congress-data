Rept. 96-596) Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 to the Department of Energy for conservation, development, and use of naval petroleum reserves and naval oil shale reserves. Directs the Secretary of the Navy, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to insure that commissioned officers of the Navy be assigned to key management positions within the Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves in such Department. Requires that the position of Director of such Office be filled by a qualified officer of the Navy in the grade of captain. Eliminates the requirement that pipelines and associated facilities for Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 have adequate capacity to accommodate not less than 350,000 barrels of oil per day and be fully operational within a specified period of time. States that funds authorized for the following purposes may not be appropriated unless specifically authorized by law: (1) exploration, prospecting, conservation, development, use, operations, and production of such reserves; (2) production; and (3) the construction and operation of facilities incident to the production and the delivery of petroleum. Stipulates that funds appropriated for such purposes shall remain available until expended. Abolishes the naval petroleum reserves special account in the Department of the Treasury. Provides that unappropriated balances of receipts in the special account shall be deposited into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury."
