    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study and report on the adverse effects; if any, on human health and the environment of the disposal and utilization of fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, flue gas emission control waste, and other byproducts of the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels. Sets forth a number of items to be included in the required analysis. Requires the Administrator to consult other Federal and State agencies in connection with the analysis in order to avoid duplication of effort. Extends until six months after completion of the required study the time for the promulgation pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, of regulations identifying the hazardous characteristics of those waste products which are the subject of this Act."
