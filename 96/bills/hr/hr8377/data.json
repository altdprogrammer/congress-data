Permits the Architect of the Capitol to enter into a contract or other agreement with the Secretary of the Interior providing for the furnishing of steam from the Capitol powerplant to the Union Station-National Visitor Center complex. Directs the Secretary to pay for such steam at rates not less than cost and to connect the Union Station-National Visitor Center complex with the Capitol powerplant steam lines without expense to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1981 for emergency repairs to the primary structure and roofs of the National Visitor Center in the District of Columbia and for protecting the structural elements of the unfinished parking facility and southeast ramp at such Center. Requires the Secretary, prior to entering into any contract for repairs or protection, to consult with the Secretary of Transportation regarding the planning for such repairs or protection."
