    "text": "Amends the Freedom of Information Act to give courts jurisdiction to enjoin Federal agencies from withholding agency records, including records pertaining to national defense or foreign policy which are properly classified pursuant to an Executive order, if the court finds no reasonable basis to support such order. Authorizes an agency to review requested investigatory records of such agency en bloc for public disclosure determinations. Extends the time period an agency may use to determine whether or not such agency will comply with a request for information. Permits an agency to charge for the cost of reviewing and examining requested records when such cost exceeds $100."
