Requires in the case of a second or subsequent conviction the imposition of a term of not less than ten nor more than 30 years (instead of not less than two nor more than 25 years). Stipulates that such additional sentence: (1) may not be suspended; (2) may not include probation; and (3) may not run concurrently. Establishes a mandatory one year term of imprisonment for anyone violating the prohibitions against trafficking in stolen firearms. Provides that the offense of theft of Government firearms shall be punished in accordance with the Gun Control Act of 1968."
