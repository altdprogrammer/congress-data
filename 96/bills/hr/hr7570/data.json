Stipulates that funds distributed under this Act are not liable to the payment of any previous contractual obligation. States that nothing in this Act shall affect the distribution of funds in judgments of the Indian Claims Commission Court of Claims. Repeals existing provisions of law which require the Secretary to designate an officer of the Government to make per capita distribution to Indians."
