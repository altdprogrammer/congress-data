    "text": "Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to disqualify, for the appropriate period of ineligibility, the entire household of any individual found guilty of specified acts of food stamp fraud. Sets the commencement of such period either: (1) immediately upon the relevant administrative or judicial finding, if the household is currently otherwise eligible; or (2) at the time such household becomes otherwise eligible, if it is not so eligible at the time of such finding. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Food Stamp Fraud Clearinghouse to collect and disseminate to requesting State agencies information with respect to enforcement of the anti-fraud provisions of such Act for purposes of determining the eligibility of individuals and households to participate in the food stamp program."
