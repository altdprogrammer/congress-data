    "text": "Fisheries Development Act of 1980 - Title I: Fishery Development Program - Establishes a fishery development program to be designed and implemented by the Secretary of Commerce. Authorizes the Secretary to take specified actions to: (1) further the development of the United States fishing industry with emphasis on new and nontraditional fisheries; (2) foster stability and efficiency in the industry; (3) encourage and help satisfy consumer demand for safe and nutritious seafood; (4) coordinate Government and federally-funded activities for the promotion of fishery exports; and (5) foster export development. Directs the Secretary, in carrying out such actions: (1) to consult and cooperate with Federal agencies, State and local government bodies, fishing industry representatives, and consumers; and (2) to establish regional committees consisting of members of Federal agencies involved with the industry to facilitate such cooperation. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, enter into contracts or cooperative agreements, and provide other forms of financial assistance to any person, organization, or Federal or State agency for fishery development programs or projects to further the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary, when necessary, to consult with the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council or State agency concerning the relationship of a proposed program to Council or agency programs for fishery conservation and management. Requires that any proposal for obtaining financial assistance specify the time period, not to exceed five years, for which funding is sought. Sets forth the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of funding such proposals. Directs the Secretary: (1) to specify the cost-sharing requirements for obtaining financial assistance; and (2) to require the recipients of such assistance to submit periodic status reports. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect the authority of any other law concerning fishery research and development, fishery conservation and management, food and safety, or consumer protection. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress, with the annual report on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a report on the fisheries development program including an evaluation of all programs and projects receiving financial assistance under this Act. Amends the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to transfer any funds remaining in the Fisheries Loan Fund as of September 30, 1980, to the fishing vessel portion of the Federal Ship Financing Fund. Directs the Secretary to provide for the guarantee of obligations relating to fishing vessels engaged in developing fisheries which might not meet the economic soundness criteria for projects eligible for loan guarantees under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. Allows such a guarantee of obligations to be extended only if financial assistance is not available on reasonable terms from non-Federal sources. Amends the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act to declare that the amount of money transferred by the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of Commerce each fiscal year for promoting domestic fishery products shall be an amount as specified in annual appropriation acts which shall not exceed 30 percent of the duties collected on fishery products."
