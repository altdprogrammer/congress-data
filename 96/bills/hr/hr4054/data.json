    "text": "Medicare Reform Act of 1979 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove the 100 visit limitation presently applicable to home health care services under such title. Eliminates prior hospitalization as a condition of eligibility for home health care services under part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) of such title. Eliminates confinement to home as a requirement for receiving home health care services under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) of such title. Includes \"periodic chore services\" within those home health services for which payment may be made under the supplementary medical insurance program. Eliminates the requirements that the months be consecutive in the 24-month Medicare waiting period for railroad retirement disability beneficiaries or old-age, survivors, and disability insurance beneficiaries who are disabled to be eligible for Medicare hospital care benefits. Eliminates payment of the $60 deductible under the Medicare program. Allows reimbursement under the Medicare program for services furnished in qualified community mental health centers and comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation centers. Authorizes payment under the Medicare program for: (1) occupational therapy services; (2) the removal of corns; warts and calluses on the feet; (3) all services of a doctor of dentistry for which such doctor is legally authorized to perform; and (4) eyeglasses, hearing aids and dentures; and examinations for the purpose of prescribing such articles."
