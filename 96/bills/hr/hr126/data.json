Stipulates that such funds shall be available without regard to matching requirements. Permits the recipient of such funds to utilize them to match any grants from the Historic Preservation Fund. Authorizes the transfer of unobligated funds previously donated to the Secretary for the purposes of the National Park Service, with the consent of the donor.
