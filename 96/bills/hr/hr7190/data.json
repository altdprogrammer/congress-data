    "text": "Nuclear Safety Research and Development Act of 1980 - Declares that the policy of the United States and the purpose of this Act is to establish a research and development program for developing practical improvements in the safety of nuclear powerplants during the next five years. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish such a program. Sets forth the goals of such program, including: (1) development of cost-beneficial changes in the design and operation of nuclear powerplants; and (2) identification of the aptitude, training, and manning levels which are necessary to assure reliable operator performance. Directs the Secretary to coordinate such activities with other Government agencies and industries dealing with complex man-machine systems. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into international agreements in the development and implementation of such program. Directs the Secretary to prepare a report identifying the risks associated with the use of all potentially significant electrical energy sources and to submit such report to: (1) the President; (2) the House Committee on Science and Technology; and (3) the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Directs that a summary of such report and a statement of its availability to the public be published in the Federal Register. Directs the Secretary to update such report annually. Directs the Secretary to prepare a comprehensive program management plan for the conduct of research and development activities under this Act. Directs that such plan be transmitted to Congress annually along with a statement setting forth specified changes in such plan and other pertinent information. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for the purposes of this Act."
