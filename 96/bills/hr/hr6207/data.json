Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants for energy conservation projects on nontoll public roads to reduce traffic congestion and facilitate traffic flow on a Federal-aid system highway. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall be 90 percent of its cost. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1990 out of the Public Transportation Trust Fund (as established by title III of this Act) for projects under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 and for public mass transportation projects substituted for Interstate Highway System projects. Title II: - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to apportion funds for the repair of public roads which have incurred a substantial increase in use as a result of transportation activities to meet national energy requirements and which will continue to incur such use. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall be 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 through 1990 for such purpose out of the Highway Trust Fund and out of the Energy Trust Fund (as established by H.R. 3919 of the 96th Congress or its equivalent). Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to separate rail highway crossings where there is a substantial increase in the use of rail facilities in transporting coal to meet national energy requirements and where the continued use of such facilities will result in substantial delays of highway travel. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall be 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for fiscal years 1980 through 1990 out of the Highway Trust Fund and the Energy Trust Fund. Title III: Public Transportation Trust Fund - Establishes within the Treasury of the United States the Public Transportation Trust Fund. Appropriates to such Fund 25 percent of the amounts received by the Treasury pursuant to the windfall profit tax on domestic crude oil. Stipulates that the proceeds of such Fund shall be used for making capital expenditures for public transportation projects or transportation systems projects under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 or under title 23 (Highways) of the United States Code."
