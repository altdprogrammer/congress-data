    "text": "Illegal Alien Control Act of 1979 - Directs the Attorney General to establish a border patrol force of not less than 3,800 officers. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exclude from the definition of the term \"immigrant\" those persons entering the United States for a period of not more than one year to perform temporary services or labor if the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Attorney General that there are not sufficient workers available at the aliens' destination who are willing and able to perform such services. Directs the Secretary to refer to employers who request such certification, workers in the number desired, able and qualified, and who agree to present themselves to commence employment on the date and for the period specified. Stipulates that a person who knowingly hires an illegal alien shall be fined or imprisoned, or both. Revises the penalties provisions of Federal law for fraud and misuse of certain immigration documents, to make the fine for such conduct not less than $250 and not more than $10,000 (currently not more than $2,000). Increases penalties for illegal entry into the United States."
