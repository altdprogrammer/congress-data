    "text": "Citizen Protection Act of 1978 - Requires a subpena duces tecum for the search and seizure of evidence when anyone acting under color of law has probable cause to believe evidence of a crime is located on or about premises in which the person in possession of the evidence has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Permits issuance of a search warrant instead of a subpena duces tecum only if there is probable cause to believe: (1) the person in possession of the evidence may be involved in the crime under investigation; or (2) the evidence sought to be seized would be destroyed, hidden, or moved if the subpena duces tecum procedures set out in this Act were followed. Creates a cause of action for any person aggrieved by a violation of this Act. Allows punitive damages of up to $10,000 for each violation."
