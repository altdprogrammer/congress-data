    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Approves and ratifies the settlement agreement between the Pamunkey Indian Tribe of King William County, Virginia, and the Southern Railway Company, pertaining to a dispute concerning the use of certain lands in the County by the Railroad. States that the Congress approves and ratifies all land transfers provided for in such agreement, and deems such transfers to have been made under applicable existing law. Directs that all prior Indian claims against the United States or the Railroad with respect to the subject matter of the agreement be waived and surrendered when such agreement becomes effective. Provides for the acceptance by the United States of the waiver executed by the Tribe on May 31, 1980, of all claims against the United States, its officers or agents, any State or subdivision thereof, or any other person or entity, with respect to lands in the Settlement Agreement. Provides that the gross income of the Tribe shall not include any amounts received under the settlement agreement. Stipulates that nothing in this Act prevents the inclusion in the gross income of any individual of any amounts which are distributed under such agreement. Authorizes the Tribe to grant easements, rights-of-way, or leases for any land occupied by such Tribe. Directs that any other transfer be subject to applicable Federal restrictions. Declares that nothing in this Act: (1) constitutes recognition of the Pamunkey Indians as a tribe subject to the plenary control of Congress; (2) affects their right to petition the Secretary of the Interior on certain other matters; or (3) imposes any trust responsibility on the United States with respect to the Tribe. Provides that the provisions of this Act shall govern to the extent that they may conflict with other Federal laws."
