Sets limits on the aggregate amount of interest that may be waived or amounts that may be paid into local currency accounts of relatively least developed countries. Increases the amount of housing guaranties that may be outstanding at any one time. Extends the housing guaranty program and the agricultural credit and self-help community development program through September 30, 1982.

Authorizes the President to establish a Council on International Technological Cooperation to advise the Institute. Authorizes the President to award Institute fellowships to citizens and foreigners in the fields of scientific, technological, economic or social endeavor.
