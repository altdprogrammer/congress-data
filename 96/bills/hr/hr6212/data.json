Authorizes States to enter into agreements and compacts with other States for the establishment of facilities for the disposal of such wastes. Authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide financial assistance to each State having such a facility to reimburse such State for costs incurred in the preconstruction activities involved in establishing such a facility. Requires that such facilities collect a fee for the receipt of such wastes set at a level necessary to amortize the full costs of construction and operation of the facility over its useful life."
