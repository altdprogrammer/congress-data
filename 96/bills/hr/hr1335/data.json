Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Requires such funds to be expended only for wages and employment benefits. Prohibits further obligation of such funds unless the rate of national unemployment (seasonally adjusted) has receded below six per cent for three consecutive months. Requires that applications for financial assistance for railroad right-of-way employment programs contain specified assurances. Directs the Secretary to transmit to Congress at least annually a detailed report setting forth the activities conducted under this Act."
