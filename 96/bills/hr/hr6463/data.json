    "text": "Uniform Relocation Assistance Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to require that relocation benefits, including relocation assistance advisory services, be made available to all persons displaced by the commencement of a Federal or federally assisted project by the head of the Federal agency administering or financing such assistance. Increases the amount of payment for moving and dislocation allowances for displacement from dwellings, business, and farm operations. Stipulates that the additional housing payments for occupant-owned dwellings shall compensate such displaced person for any increased real property taxes which such person will incur during the life of the mortgage on the replacement dwelling. Increases the amount of replacement housing payments for tenants and certain other persons to enable such displaced persons to rent or lease a dwelling or to make a downpayment on the purchase of a dwelling. Stipulates that the assurances required of the relocation assistance advisory services that housing will be available shall: (1) be made prior to Federal approval of a project; (2) be based upon careful analysis of the housing needs of the persons to be displaced and the availability of housing; and (3) include plans for housing replacement by the Federal agency as last resort if comparable replacement sale or rental housing is not available. Authorizes the agency head to use funds authorized for the project to provide such housing. Directs the President to designate an agency which shall establish a single uniform set of regulations and procedures for use by Federal agencies and by States, State and local agencies, and other recipients of Federal financial assistance. Requires such agency to assure the uniform application and interpretation of such regulations and procedures. Makes provisions for aggrieved persons to petition such agency for a hearing. Requires such agency annually to make adjustments, beginning fiscal in year 1982, for inflation in housing costs. Authorizes the head of a Federal agency administering or financing a project to offer to acquire property from any person owning property affected by such project who is left with an uneconomic remnant in order to entitle the owner and occupant to full benefits under this Act. Makes this Act effective on October 1, 1980."
