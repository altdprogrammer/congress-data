    "text": "Biomass Research and Development Act of 1980 - Declares it to be the purpose of this Act to: (1) make the cost of energy produced by biomass systems competitive; (2) increase the efficiency of biomass energy production; (3) encourage the development of biomass energy resources on land unsuited for cultivating food; and (4) assure the production of at least three quadrillion British thermal units of energy per year from biomass by 1986. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to establish a six-year biomass energy system research and development program to carry out the purposes of this Act. States that the program shall consist of: (1) a feedstocks program; (2) a conversion program; and (3) an end uses program. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish procedures to permit any public or private entity wishing to install a biomass energy system to apply for and receive assistance in purchasing such a system. Directs the Secretary, after the termination of the six year program, to promulgate by rule voluntary performance standards for biomass energy systems. Directs the Secretary to initiate a three-year national biomass resource assessment program. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive program management plan for the conduct of the programs established under this Act. Sets forth criteria for program selection. Directs the Secretary to monitor the performance and operation of biomass energy systems assisted or installed under this Act. Directs the Secretary to study and evaluate specified matters related to the development of biomass energy systems and report the findings to Congress. Establishes a biomass energy utilization program for the accelerated procurement and installation of biomass energy systems for power production for Federal facilities. Requires the Secretary to take steps to assure that small business will have adequate opportunities to participate in the programs established under this Act."
