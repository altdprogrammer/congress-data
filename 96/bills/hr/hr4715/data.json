Provides for an international meeting to create an ad hoc intergovernmental commission to establish such program and create a permanent international organization to administer such program. Declares that such program shall be carried out through one or more research and development centers taking full advantage of any adequate existing facilities. Stipulates that such centers emphasize coal liquefaction. Provides for the sharing of costs and energy production techniques among participating countries. Directs the Secretary of Energy to assess the U.S. synthetic fuel needs and the capabilities of other countries for participation in such program."
