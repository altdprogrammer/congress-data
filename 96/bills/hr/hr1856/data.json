Directs the President to require the leaders of the missions to the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China to monitor the access and availability of those markets to U.S. exports. Requires the President to report any declines in such exports to the appropriate congressional committees. Stipulates that all trade benefits to either nation will cease in the event of any armed conflict, boycott, or blockade between the two nations. Prohibits compliance with any foreign boycott of the Republic of China."
