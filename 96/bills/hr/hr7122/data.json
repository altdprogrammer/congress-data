Authorizes the Chairperson of the Commission to secure any information from Federal agencies not exempted from disclosure by rule of law. Directs that any claim for relief under this Act shall be submitted to the Commission within 12 months after the date of enactment of such Act. Requires the Commission, within 120 days of receipt of such claim, to hold a hearing to determine the eligibility and amount of damages due any such claimant. Declares a claimant eligible for damages if: (1) a timely claim has been filed; (2) the Guillain-Barre Syndrome was contracted within 20 weeks after immunization; and (3) the claimant has not received a full settlement of such claim against the United States. Specifies time periods under which the Commission shall make a final determination pursuant to any claim and to make payment of damages due any claimant. Declares that any payment to a claimant shall be in full settlement of all claims of such claimant against the United States arising out of the swine flu program. Directs the Commission to submit a final report to the President and each House of Congress pursuant to its operations under this Act, within three years after the date of enactment of such Act.
