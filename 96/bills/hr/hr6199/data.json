Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 through 1984. Limits the total amount of any grant to one-third of the costs of such municipal arts program. Exempts 15 percent of the funds available to the Chairman from this restriction. Directs the Chairman to submit to Congress timely requests for additional authorizations for fiscal years 1985 through 1988. Sets forth requirements for applications for grants, including summaries of projected uses of such funds, general sources of revenue, and assurances of citizen participation in the planning process of such program. Limits the percentage of funds which may be expended for planning and administration purposes. Directs the Chairman to approve an application unless the activities fall clearly outside the purposes of this Act. Sets forth the activities eligible for assistance under a municipal arts program. Requires grants to cities and metropolitan areas with populations of less than 500,000 to be reviewed by the State agency except as specified. States that an application will be deemed approved unless disapproved. Sets forth the formula for the allocation and distribution of funds for annual grants. Creates a discretionary fund for each of the fiscal years in an amount equal to ten percent of authorizations for grants to be used by the Chairman in making grants for specified purposes, including special studies service centers and clearinghouses.
