    "text": "National Ridesharing Act of 1980 - Transfers specified provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 relating to carpool and vanpool projects to Federal highway law, as codified. Includes specified recipients of financial assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 among those to whom the Secretary of Transportation may make grants and loans for carpool and vanpool projects. Prohibits the use of such grants for the construction of highway lanes as preferential carpool or vanpool highway lanes, or for the construction of parking facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Transportation a National Office of Ridesharing to coordinate all carpooling and vanpooling activities within the Department. Requires the Office, in connection with carpooling and vanpooling, to: (1) set national goals for reduction of pollution and traffic and conservation of motor fuel; (2) compile statistics; (3) perform economic analyses; (4) provide promotion, technical assistance, and public information; (5) evaluate national impacts of, and identify obstacles to, such programs; and (6) report and recommend legislation to Congress. Directs the Secretary to report annually on such programs to the President and the Congress. Prohibits the Secretary from approving, after January 1, 1982, the granting of such carpooling or vanpooling financial assistance to be used in any urban area of more than 50,000 population unless the Secretary finds that such assistance is based on a continuing comprehensive transportation planning process carried on cooperatively by States and local communities. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 to increase the amount of the authorization of appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for specified assistance for carpool and vanpool projects for fiscal year 1981 and to extend the authorization of such appropriations through fiscal year 1982. Increases the amounts authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund for specified grants and loans for such projects for fiscal year 1979, 1980, and 1981, and extends such authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1982. Provides that, to the extent authorized by Acts governing the use of funds available in the windfall profit tax account, such funds shall be available, as provided in appropriation Acts, for such financial assistance for such projects. Limits the amounts of such funds available for specified purposes in fiscal year 1982."
