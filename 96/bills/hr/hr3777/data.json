    "as": "Passed House amended",

    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #533 (319-68)) Repeals the provision of Federal law which allows a Member of Congress to send matter expressing condolences or congratulations for achievements of personal distinction as franked mail. Retains the provision to allow franked mail matter expressing congratulations for achievements of public distinction. Extends from 28 to 60 days the period of time before an election during which a Member may not, consistent with the policy of Congress, use his or her mail franking privileges if such Member is a candidate for re-election in such election. Declares that the use of such franking privilege for mass mailing outside of a Member's or Member-elect's home district is not within the policy of Congress if such person is a candidate for any other office. Requires franked mail to be sent by the most economical means. Limits the number of pieces of franked mail sent to six times the number of addresses to which such mail may be delivered under existing law. Requires Members of, or Members-elect to, the House of Representatives to submit mail, which is intended to be sent as franked mail under provisions allowing a simplified form of address, to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards (hereinafter referred to as the \"Commission\") for an advisory opinion as to whether such proposed mailing is in compliance with such provisions. Prohibits a Member-elect from sending as franked mail any mail for which the printing costs are not paid from funds appropriated by Congress, excluding public service material that is purely instructional or informational and is frankable in content. Extends to surviving relatives the franking privilege of the spouse of a Member of Congress who died in office in the event there is no surviving spouse (such privilege covering only mail relating to the death of such Member mailed within 180 days of death). Expands the authority of the Commission to cover advisory opinions involving any non-criminal law regarding franked mail. Authorizes the Commission to issue regulations or investigate franking privilege violations in connection with any other Federal law (other than criminal statutes) or in connection with any rule of the House relating to franked mail. Extends the Commission's jurisdiction over franking violations to include complaints against former Members and officers of the House."
