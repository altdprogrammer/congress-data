    "text": "Amends the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to direct the Secretary of Energy to issue coal conversion orders or rules requiring specified existing electric powerplants and major fuel-burning installations to convert from petroleum or natural gas to coal as a primary energy source, unless the Secretary grants an exemption thereof. Lists the facilities covered by this Act, including facilities in Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Maine, Illinois, Delaware, New Jersey, Michigan, Georgia, Connecticut, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, Colorado, New Hampshire, Florida, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Authorizes the Secretary to grant temporary and permanent exemptions to such orders or rules upon his determination that compliance with such orders or rules will result in violations of applicable environmental requirements. Exempts the issuance of such orders or rules from consideration as \"major Federal actions\" for purposes of the environmental impact statement provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
