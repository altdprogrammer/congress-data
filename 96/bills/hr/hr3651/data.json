Stipulates that restrictions on the taking of populations of fish and wildlife on such lands for subsistence uses in order to protect the continued viability of such populations, or to continue such uses, shall be based on: (1) customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the mainstay of livelihood; (2) local residency; and (3) the availability of alternative resources. Authorizes the States to regulate the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses in a manner consistent with the policies and requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary, if the State fails to exercise its authority to regulate subsistence uses, to establish: (1) at least seven Alaska subsistence resource regions which, taken together, include all public lands; (2) such local advisory committees within each region, as necessary, based upon a finding that the existing State fish and game advisory committees do not adequately assist in the preparation of the reports required of the regional councils; and (3) a regional advisory council in each subsistence region, to be composed of residents of the affected region. Sets forth the duties of such regional councils in regard to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife within the regions, including the preparation of annual reports to the Secretary. Requires that such reports contain identifications, evaluations and recommended strategies for the management of fish and wildlife populations within the regions, as well as recommendations concerning policies, standards, guidelines, and regulations to implement such strategies.

Directs the Secretary to monitor State regulation of the subsistence preference granted under this title and to advise the States and Congress of his findings and recommendations. Directs the local and regional advisory councils established by this title to notify the Secretary if any such council determines that the State has not adequately provided for a system of subsistence preference in the region or locality which such council represents. Directs the Secretary to review the determinations of any council and advise the State of his findings. Directs the Secretary to close public areas to all consumptive uses except subsistence uses by local residents if he determines that the States has failed to comply with directives from the Secretary regarding improvements in the subsistence preference program and that such failure endangers the fish or wildlife population in an area or the ability of rural residents to satisfy their subsistence needs. Sets forth procedures for hearing and appeal by the State. Gives the Secretary emergency authority to close any public land to subsistence uses if necessary for public safety, administration, or to insure the natural stability and continued productivity of one or more fish or wildlife populations. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements or to otherwise cooperate with other Federal agencies, the State of Alaska, Native Corporations, and other appropriate persons and organizations, (including, through coordination with the Secretary of State, other nations) in order to protect subsistence resources and uses. Prohibits Federal agencies from withdrawal, reservation, lease, permit, or other use, occupancy or disposition of lands within their jurisdiction if the effect would be to significantly restrict the subsistence uses unless the head of the agency: (1) gives notice to the appropriate State agency, local committees and regional councils; (2) gives notice of, and holds, a hearing in the vicinity of the area involved; and (3) makes specific determinations regarding the purpose and the effect of the restriction. Directs the Secretary to insure the access to subsistence resources on public lands to persons engaged in subsistence uses. Directs the Secretary, acting through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service to undertake research on fish and wildlife resources and subsistence activities on the public lands.

Stipulates that land owned by the State, a political subdivision, or a Native Corporation may only be acquired with their consent. Sets forth administrative provisions relating to such acquisitions. Allows the Secretary to permit on conservation system units the use of snow machines, motorboats, airplanes, and nonmotorized transportation methods, subject to reasonable regulation. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire up to 7,500 acres of archaeological or paleontological sites outside of the Cape Krusenstern National Park, Bering Land Bridge National Park, Kobuk Valley National Park, and the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Park. Requires the Secretary, prior to acquiring any such property in excess of 100 acres, to submit notice of the proposed acquisition to the appropriate committees of the Congress, and publish notice of such proposed acquisition in the Federal Register. Directs the Secretary to provide advice, assistance, and technical expertise to an applying Native Corporation or Native Group for the purpose of preserving cultural resources, without regard to whether title to such resources is in the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate and plan for an information and education center for visitors to Alaska, on no more than 1,000 acres of land adjacent to the Alaska Highway. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate and plan for such centers in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to investigate and plan for centers in Juneau, Ketchikan, or Sitka. Authorizes the Secretary to establish administrative sites and visitor facilities within the conservation units, if compatible, or outside the units. Directs the Secretary to locate such sites and facilities on Native lands where practicable and desirable. Sets forth the authorities of the Secretary in regard to establishing such sites and facilities. Directs the Secretary, under reasonable terms, to permit a person who on or before January 1, 1979, was adequately providing any type of visitor service to a conservation system unit, to continue providing the services if they are consistent with the purposes of the unit. Requires that the Secretary, in selecting persons to provide visitor services, give preference to Native Corporations most directly affected by the conservation system unit, and local residents. Directs the Secretary to establish a local-hire program, under which the Secretary will consider for selection qualified local residents to positions in any of the conservation system units, without regard to civil service regulations which require minimum periods of formal training or experience, other preference provisions, or numerical limitations on personnel. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports and recommendations to Congress on such program. Requires the Secretary to prepare detailed management plans for national park and wildlife refuge units and submit them to Congress within five years of the date of enactment of this Act. Sets forth requirements for such plans, factors which must be considered, public hearings requirements, and requirements for reports to the appropriate committees of Congress. Closes all areas of the National Park System in Alaska to the taking of fish and wildlife, except for authorized subsistence use, fishing, and sport hunting as the Secretary may permit within national preserves. Stipulates that other conservation units will be subject to applicable Federal and State law with respect to the taking of fish and wildlife. Authorizes the issuance of permits to certain sport hunting guide services and nonsubsistence trappers to continue the taking of wildlife in connection with their business for a period not to exceed ten years from the enactment of this Act, if the Secretary determines that a termination of such privilege would result in serious economic hardship for such individuals. Requires that the boundary maps described in this Act shall be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture. Specifies that in the event of discrepancies between the acreages stated in this Act and those depicted on such maps, the maps shall be controlling. Prohibits the boundaries of areas added to the national systems to extend beyond the mean high tide line to include lands owned by the State unless the State concurs. Directs that a map and legal description of each change in land management status effected by this Act be published in the Federal Register and filed with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, and that each such description shall have the same force as if included in this Act. Directs that the Secretary shall make each such map and description available for public inspection. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to make minor adjustments in the boundaries or areas added to or established by this Act, as appropriate, following reasonable notice in writing to Congress. Permits reasonable access to and operation and maintenance of existing air and navigation aids and facilities for weather, climate, and fisheries research and monitoring in accordance with applicable law. Authorizes reasonable access to and operation and maintenance of, existing facilities for national defense purposes, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act. Permits the establishment of new facilities for national defense purposes within any conservation unit after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture by the head of the applicable Federal department, in accordance with terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed in order to minimize the adverse effects within such unit.
