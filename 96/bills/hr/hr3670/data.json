    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-04-24", 
    "text": "Federally Funded Construction Contract Act of 1979 - Amends the Davis-Bacon Act to stipulate that the minimum wages for workers under a construction contract entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia exceeding $2,000 (hereinafter referred to as a \"contract\") shall be based on prevailing rates for employees performing similar work in the county where the construction is performed (as determined by the Secretary of Labor). Requires the contractor to notify each employee of such wages on the employee's first day of work. Eliminates provisions governing the method and frequency of payment of wages. Directs each executive department and agency which administers a Federal financial assistance program to require the applicant for assistance to incorporate the provisions of this Act into any such a contract to be funded by such assistance. Prohibits any contractor who enters into a federally funded construction contract from paying workers less than: (1) the minimum wage specified under the Fair Labor Standards Act; or (2) the wages and fringe benefits provided in the collective bargaining agreement applicable to corresponding classes of employees in the county. Provides for the review of the Secretary's determination of prevailing rate wages when there is a substantial difference between the wages which actually prevail in the county and the wages under such a collective bargaining agreement which covers less than 30 percent of the similar employees in the county. Makes each agency responsible for obtaining compliance with the orders of the Secretary concerning a contract entered into by the agency or its contractors. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate any such contractor. Prohibits barring a contractor from obtaining Federally funded contracts without affording the contractor an opportunity for a hearing concerning any violation of a provision of this Act. States that the contractors shall be liable for any underpayment of employee compensation in violation of this Act. Specifies conditions under which an employee may commence an action against a contractor in a United States district court. States that this Act supercedes all other provisions of Federal law providing for the inclusion of minimum wages in such a contract."
