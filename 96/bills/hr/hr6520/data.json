    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 96-1158) Reclamation Reform Act of 1980 - Sets forth acreage limitations for limited and qualified landholdings which may be served with water under Federal reclamation laws. Amends the Federal reclamation laws to require that contracts entered into by the Secretary of the Interior with a water district for repayment or water service include a water conservation program for all uses of water which is provided from, or conveyed through, federally constructed or federally financed facilities. Requires such program to contain definite goals, appropriate water conservation measures, and time schedules for meeting the water conservation objectives. Makes persons owning not more than 960 acres within such district eligible for such program. Requires such contracts to provide for the delivery of project water to farm operations within the district, priced according to an established schedule. Directs the Secretary at five-year intervals to recalculate the cost of delivering project water to each district and to modify such schedule accordingly. Requires surplus water provided in unusually wet years or from infrequent flood flows of short duration to be distributed to any farm operation in a district at the base cost. Declares that, upon the request of a land owner or lessee, the acreage limitation for a qualified landholding shall be considered applicable to: (1) a specified amount of land classified by the Secretary of the Interior as project land having the greatest productive potential; or (2) an equivalent amount of less productive land. Directs the Secretary to take into account all factors which affect the economic feasibility of irrigated agriculture in determining the productive potential of land and land classes. States that any land for which the frost-free growing season exceeds 180 days, shall be considered to be highly productive land for purposes of acreage limitations, except under certain conditions. Specifies those lands which may receive project water three years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to deliver project water to certain excess lands, and lands which would otherwise be excess, provided that such lands otherwise would be eligible to receive project water. Grants nonexcess qualified recipients the first option to purchase such water. Amends existing Federal reclamation laws to delete the 25-year limitation on the receipt of project water by lessees of lands owned by States and political subdivisions which are subject to acreage limitations. States that no provision of Federal reclamation law shall apply to landholdings receiving benefits from a Federal water resources project unless: (1) that project has been designated as a Federal reclamation project; (2) the Secretary has provided project works for the control or conveyance of an agricultural water supply for the lands involved; or (3) the provisions of the Federal reclamation laws are by Federal statute explicitly made applicable to the lands involved. Declares that no owner or qualified lessee of a limited or qualified landholding shall be required to be a resident of such landholding to be eligible to receive project water for agricultural purposes. Prohibits an owner of a qualified landholding acquired after the enactment of this Act from leasing such landholding unless the Secretary determines that the owner, during each of the last five years after acquiring the land, has derived a significant percentage of his or her income directly from agricultural production. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or grant exemptions from such agricultural production requirements. Exempts from such requirement any owner who resides within 50 miles of the landholding. Amends the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 to direct the Secretary to publish notice of the proposed contract or amendment and provide an opportunity for written comments, before entering into or amending any repayment contract or contract concerning the delivery of project water for irrigation purposes. Directs the Secretary to sell by lottery to qualified recipients any lands in excess of the acreage limitation which have not been disposed of at the end of the recordable contract period. Repeals provisions which limit the right to receive water on sold excess lands until one-half of the construction charges have been paid. Sets forth requirements to be met before a sale of excess land, or resale of such land within 15 years of initial sale, shall carry rights to receive project water. Declares that any nonexcess land which is acquired into excess status pursuant to foreclosure or other process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of mortgage, inheritance, or devise, may be sold at its fair market value without regard to provisions of this Act or existing law. Exempts lands within the Imperial Irrigation District of California from the acreage and residency limitations in water rights and the requirement that contracts for the repayment of project construction costs be made before water will be delivered. Approves water contracts pertaining to qualified landholdings, which provide that relief from acreage limitations will result upon full payment of construction charges. Specifies the expiration date for acreage limitations following the repayment of construction charges which shall apply in any case in which such date is not specified in the project repayment contract. Directs the Secretary to provide a landholder with a certificate acknowledging any relief from acreage limitations. Directs the Secretary to coordinate water conservation programs with non-Federal entities. Sets forth administrative rules and regulations, and penalties for violations, under this Act."
