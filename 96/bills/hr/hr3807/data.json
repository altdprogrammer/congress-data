Makes technical changes to provisions of such subtitle. Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission to stay or postpone a nonrail decision if an application for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration is made before the decision becomes effective. Authorizes the Commission to issue orders supplemental to an order made in a proceeding concerning the combination of services or the consolidation of common carriers. Declares that the provisions of this Act may not be construed as making substantive changes in Federal law. Prohibits an inference of legislative construction by reason of the location in the U.S. Code of a provision enacted by this Act."
