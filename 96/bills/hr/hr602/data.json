Stipulates that the President's authority under this Act shall continue until June 30, 1990. Authorizes the President to make subsidy payments for domestically produced supplies of strategic or critical materials under specified circumstances to insure that necessary high-cost sources are continued or that maximum production or supply is maintained at stable prices. Authorizes the President to install additional equipment, facilities, processes, or improvements at United States industrial facilities and to install Government-owned equipment in private industrial facilities if such actions would aid the national defense.
