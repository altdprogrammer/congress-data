Authorizes the Board to borrow or lend money in connection with any scholarship program approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Empowers the Board to: (1) procure by contract the temporary and intermittent services of experts or consultants; (2) provide such consultants with per diem, travel, and transportation expenses; (3) administer the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, including taking appropriate steps toward attaining accreditation status; (4) solicit, accept, and sell and transfer gifts, bequests, devises of money, and securities; (5) acquire and dispose of personal property as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act; and (6) construct new, and repair existing, structures on the campus of the Institute. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer all administrative powers and responsibilities for functions of the Institute from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Requires the Secretary to phase out any entities, other than the Institute, occupying facilities of the campus within three years of enactment of this Act. Directs the Board to submit an annual report to the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress on the activities, accreditation status, and enrollment of the Institute."
