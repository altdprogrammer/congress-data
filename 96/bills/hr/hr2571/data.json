    "text": "Nursing Home Reform Act of 1979 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize a deduction for amounts paid during the taxable year by the taxpayer for skilled nursing and intermediate care facility expenses for an individual if such individual is a dependent of the taxpayer in all respects except for the receipt of at least half of his support from such taxpayer. Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to permit the payment of supplemental security income to residents in nonmedical shelter care facilities in any State if such State certifies that the residents are ambulatory, needing only minimum supervision, and that the amount of State supplementation is not less than $100 per resident per month. Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to redefine the term \"skilled nursing facility\" to require that such facilities, in order to qualify under Title XVIII, provide the services set forth in this Act. Requires skilled nursing facilities to conclude a contract with each patient upon admission. Specifies that such contract shall cover the rights and duties of the patient and the facility. Requires such a facility to post conspicuously certain notices and materials, including: (1) a State license; (2) a description of services offered and their costs; (3) a list of the owners; (4) a list of all licensed personnel; and (5) a copy of the patient's bill of rights as published in the Federal Register. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a review of State plans approved under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act at least once a year to determine each State's compliance with and the quality of the administration of its plan. Directs the Secretary to establish a rating system for nursing homes participating in the programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act. Requires skilled nursing facilities to maintain a system assuring a complete accounting of its patients' property. Allows Medicare beneficiaries to bring suit against any skilled nursing facility for specific performance in any Federal district court without reference to the $10,000 jurisdictional amount. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to any nonprofit organization, church, or association of churches to meet all or a part of the cost of construction or rehabilitation of a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility which will be owned and operated by such church, organization, or association. Authorizes the Secretary to make interest reduction payments under specified circumstances with respect to a mortgage covering repair or rehabilitation of a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility in order to correct physical deficiencies and comply with Federal minimum standards. Establishes a program of grants to any church, association of churches, or other nonprofit organization to meet all or part of the cost of planning, developing, constructing, or rehabilitation a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility owned by such entity and located in an area where there is a shortage of nursing home beds, giving preference to areas serving black and other minority communities. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President submit to the Congress an action plan which would provide a suitable multiagency plan for dealing with nursing home abuses. Authorizes the President to call a White House Conference on Long-Term Care in 1981, in order to develop recommendations for action in establishing a national policy with respect to the needs of disabled Americans with primary emphasis on the physically and mentally impaired aged. Establishes an Advisory Committee to the White House Conference on Long-Term Care."
