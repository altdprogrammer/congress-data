Directs the Board to select a Director of the Center who, with the concurrence of the Board, may enter into such contracts and arrangements with government agencies, universities, nonprofit organizations, profitmaking corporations, and individuals as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act. Requires the Board and the Director to jointly prepare a short, medium, and long-range plan of activities for the Center.
