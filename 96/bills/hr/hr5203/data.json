Enumerates items which must be set forth in any contract between a sales representative and a principal. Title II: Indemnification - Exempts principals conforming with such information requirements from the indemnification provisions set forth in this Act. Requires a principal who, without good cause, terminates a contract between such principal and a sales representative, or reduces the rate of commission for orders solicited on behalf of such principal, to indemnify the representative according to this Act. Requires a principal who reduces the size of the geographic territory assigned to a representative for a specified account, which results in a specified reduction in commissions, to indemnify such representative. Sets forth formulae for the indemnification of such representatives. Title III: Miscellaneous - Allows a plaintiff to bring an action to enforce any rights or liabilities created by this Act in a United States district court. Stipulates the procedure for such action."
