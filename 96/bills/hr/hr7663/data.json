Provides that the membership of such committee shall include former POW's of World War II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam era and individuals who are recognized authorities in certain fields of medicine. Allows officials of other executive agencies to be included on such committee. Directs the committee to submit a report, biennially, to the Administrator on its activities. Makes POW's with the disease of psychosis manifest to a degree of ten percent presumably eligible for wartime disability benefits (presently such psychosis must have occurred within two years of separation from service). Entitles POW's of World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict, or the Vietnam era eligible for hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care benefits. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations and furnish medical services for any disability on an outpatient or ambulatory basis to such POW's. Requires the President to designate an appropriate date for the annual observance of \"National P.O.W./M.I.A. Recognition Day.\""
