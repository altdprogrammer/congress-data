Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) collect any profits owed by a contractor by setoff against any amounts due such contractor; or (2) waive the requirements of this Act with regard to any contract or subcontract. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to the Congress concerning actions taken under this Act. Repeals provisions setting forth naval vessel contract requirements."
