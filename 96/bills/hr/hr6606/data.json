    "text": "Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 - Title I: Community and Neighborhood Development and Conservation - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to define the term \"metropolitan city\" to specify that it shall not include any city whose population is included in the population of an urban county. Specifies for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983 that no data derived from the 1980 Decennial Census, except those relating to population and poverty, shall be taken into account for purposes of the allocation of funds to metropolitan areas. Prohibits, for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, any revision to the criteria for establishing a metropolitan area or defining a central city of such an area published after January 1, 1980, to be taken into account for purposes of this title, except in the case of any area or city which would newly qualify as a metropolitan area or a central city of such an area. Specifies that, with respect to grants for State, tribal, and local community development programs, beginning in fiscal year 1981, the population of any unit of general local government which is included in that of an urban county shall be included in the population of such urban county for three program years beginning with the program year in which its population was first so included. Requires any county seeking qualification as an urban county, including any urban county seeking to continue such qualification, to notify each unit of general local government, which is included therein and is eligible to elect to have its population excluded from that of an urban county, of its opportunity to make such an election. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for the purpose of making grants to States and units of local government to help finance community development programs for fiscal years 1980 through 1983. Authorizes funds for fiscal years 1980 through 1983 for the purpose of assisting severely distressed cities that require supplemental grant assistance in order to alleviate excessive deterioration through neighborhood reclamation and community revitalization. Limits amounts of appropriated funds which may be used to aid metropolitan cities, urban counties, and other units of local government within metropolitan areas to meet their hold-harmless needs. Amends the Housing Act of 1964 to define the term \"congregate housing\" as residential property in which some or all of the dwelling units do not contain kitchen or bathroom facilities. Extends the rehabilitation loan program under such Act to include congregate housing and to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 for community and neighborhood development and conservation programs. Authorizes appropriations, through fiscal year 1982, for the neighborhood self-help development programs under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to reimburse the Veterans Administration for properties transferred to urban homesteading programs. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such programs through fiscal year 1982. Title II: Housing Assistance Programs - Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into contracts for annual contributions under the United States Housing Act of 1937 for low-income housing projects in fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for operating assistance for troubled multifamily housing projects under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. Amends the National Housing Act to direct the Secretary to utilize amounts credited to the rental housing assistance fund for the sole purpose of carrying out assistance for troubled multifamily housing projects through September 30, 1982. Increases the allowable maximum amount for mortgage assistance payments under the National Housing Act. Authorizes appropriations for such mortgage assistance payments through October 1, 1981. Allows the Secretary, under the mortgage insurance program, to insure a mortgage involving a principal obligation which exceeds, by not more than 10 percent, the maximum limits, if such mortgage relates to a dwelling to be occupied by a physically handicapped person. Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to require a public housing agency or nonprofit corporation applying for assistance to provide congregate services: (1) to elderly residents to consult with the Area Agency on Aging; and (2) to nonelderly handicapped residents to consult with the appropriate agency. Title III: Program Amendments and Extensions - Extends for two years through September 30, 1982, the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to insure mortgages or loans under certain HUD mortgage or loan insurance programs under the National Housing Act and to set interest rates for insured mortgage loans. Extends until October 1, 1982, the authority of the Government National Mortgage Association to enter into new commitments to purchase mortgages under the interim mortgage purchase authority of the National Housing Act, as amended by the Emergency Home Purchase Assistance Act of 1974. Authorizes appropriations for research and demonstration housing projects through fiscal year 1981. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize appropriations to cover losses sustained by the General Insurance Fund. Allows the President to authorize the Government National Mortgage Association to make payments to financial institutions for the purpose of subsidizing below market rate loans which are secured under the National Housing Act covering properties consisting of five or more dwelling units. Authorizes appropriations to make such payments through fiscal year 1982. Amends the National Housing Act to increase the mortgage purchase authority of the Government National Mortgage Association. Increases, by up to 20 percent, the amounts which may be insured under the National Housing Act for multifamily and institutional projects if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation of a solar energy system. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary, in collecting or compromising claims or obligations under the mortgage insurance program, to contract with private business concerns or agencies for payment for services rendered by such concerns or agencies in assisting the Secretary in making such collection or compromise. Requires a mortgage, in order to be eligible for mortgage insurance under the National Housing Act, to have a period of not less than 10 years to run beyond the maturity date of the mortgage. Makes mortgaged property located where concentrated housing, physical development, and public service activities are being or will be carried out in a coordinated manner, pursuant to a locally developed strategy for neighborhood improvement, conservation, or preservation, eligible for rehabilitation and neighborhood conservation housing insurance under the National Housing Act. Authorizes the Secretary, as an alternative to the acquisition of an insured mortgage to avoid foreclosure, to make all or part of the monthly payments due on an insured mortgage of a one to four family residence necessary to avoid default caused by circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control. Stipulates that such payments may be provided for a period of up to 18 months which may be extended for an additional 18 months at the discretion of the Secretary. Prohibits any such payments in the case of any mortgage with respect to which the Secretary has received a notice of default on or after August 2, 1984. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Small Business Administration, to provide for the participation by lower income persons and socially and economically disadvantaged firms in federally assisted projects.

Declares that the land transferred by the city of Springfield, Illinois, to the United States Department of the Interior for the Lincoln Home National Historic Site shall be deemed to have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Housing Act of 1961 and any other law and with any regulations or other requirements in implementation thereof. Title IV: Planning Assistance - Declares that the following are national policy objectives with respect to housing under the Housing Act of 1954: (1) the conservation and improvement of existing communities; (2) an increase in housing and employment opportunities and choices; and (3) the promotion of orderly and efficient growth and development of communities, regions, and States, taking into consideration the necessity of conserving energy. Declares that it is the purpose of this title to help achieve these objectives by: (1) encouraging the joint efforts of State and local governments and areawide planning organizations in developing State and areawide strategies; and (2) assuring that strategies developed pursuant to this section will lead to implementation activities by States, areawide planning organizations, and local governments. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to contract to make, and to make, grants approved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section to: (1) States, for statewide activities; (2) States, for the provision of assistance to metropolitan areawide planning organizations, nonmetropolitan areawide planning organizations, units of general local government, counties other than urban counties, and any group of adjacent units of general local government having a total population of less than 50,000; (3) metropolitan areawide planning organizations; and (4) the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
