    "text": "Veterans' Medical Amendments Act of 1979 - Title I: Veterans' Health Care and Related Benefits Amendments - Revises travel expense provisions for veterans with non-service connected disabilities traveling to and from Veterans' Administration (VA) facilities to permit reimbursement only when: (1) the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs authorizes such transportation in advance; and (2) special vehicular means of transportation are required. Eliminates the restriction that the Administrator may provide necessary medical services only within VA facilities for housebound veterans receiving additional aid and attendance benefits (or who would be so entitled except for retired pay). Eliminates outpatient dental services for veterans with dental conditions that were in existence during active service and who made applications to have such condition treated within one year after discharge or release from such service. Limits the provision of outpatient non-prescription drugs, medicines, or medical supplies to those veterans: (1) receiving a service pension, non-service-connected disability pension, or death benefits pension; (2) 65 years or older; (3) permanently housebound; (4) in need of regular aid and attendance; or (5) receiving home health services. Provides that medical examinations for compensation or pension claims be included in the third priority category for purposes of veterans' outpatient care. Authorizes the Administrator to provide medical care for surviving dependents of a person dying in active military service. Stipulates that a person dying in active military service shall be considered a veteran for purposes of such survivors' and dependents' benefits. Provides that a child between 18 and 23 who is eligible for such benefits who suffers a disabling illness or injury while in full-time attendance at an approved educational institution which prevents him from resuming such attendance shall remain eligible for such benefits for six months after the disability is removed, until two years after the onset of such illness, or until the student's twenty-third birthday. Provides maximum allowable costs for modification of certain rehabilitative devices equal to the maximum allowable cost of specified home improvements and structural alterations. Title II: Veterans' Medical Personnel Amendments - Includes psychologists within the list of those who may be appointed by the Administrator to positions in the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery. Sets forth qualification standards for such appointments. Requires podiatrists and optometrists to be United States citizens in order to be appointed to such Department. Shortens the probationary period for medical appointments for such Department from three to two years. Provides that a probationary employee not found satisfactory by a standards review board may be reassigned, as well as terminated (presently must be terminated). Title III: Medical Resources Utilization Amendments - Authorizes the Administrator to enter into agreements with organ and blood banks, and other similar institutions."
