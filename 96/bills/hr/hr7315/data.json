    "text": "National Economic Dislocation Act of 1980 - Requires a business concern to give notice, with an economic impact statement, to the Secretary of Labor and to affected employees, labor organizations, and local governments whenever such business concern intends to undertake a change of operations at an establishment which will result in an employment loss in any 18-month period for the lesser of 15 percent or 100 of the employees at such establishment. Requires, with exceptions, that such notice be given not later than one year before such business concern reduces the weekly wages or suspends or terminates the employment of any employee in connection with such change. Directs the Secretary to investigate and hold public hearings on specified matters related to such change upon receipt of a written request for such investigation from an affected labor organization or from at least ten percent of the employees at such establishment. Requires such request to be made within 60 days of receipt of notice. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate and hold closed hearings on such matters, without regard to whether such notice is given, upon: (1) a determination that such investigation would serve the purpose of this Act; or (2) a request from at least 50 percent of such employees. Empowers the Secretary to issue subpoenas for witnesses and evidence in such investigations. Directs the Secretary to prepare and publish a report of such investigation. Makes employees who accept employment with such business concerns, with knowledge that such notice has been given, ineligible for specified assistance under this Act. Requires such business concerns to give written statements of employment status to employees whose weekly wages are lowered by a specified amount or who are suspended or terminated. Stipulates that an employee will be deemed to suffer an employment loss if a business concern fails to: (1) give such a statement of employment status to an employee; or (2) include in such statement an assurance of increased wages or reinstatement. Requires a business concern which gives such assurance, yet fails to prevent such employment loss, to pay such employee a lump sum in a specified amount in addition to other required payments. Requires a business concern, for a 52-week period following an employment loss, to make payments: (1) to the employee in a weekly income maintenance payment equal to 85 percent of such employees's wage rate; and (2) to specified employment benefit plans for such employees. Sets forth conditions under which such payments may be reduced or limited. Stipulates that such payments are not to be deemed wages for all other purposes, including specified employee benefit plans. Requires such business concerns to pay moving expenses for employees who resume employment with the same business concerns within three years. Requires such business concerns to continue weekly income maintenance payments to employees who have attained 55 years of age when the 52-week payment period expires. Directs the Secretary to reimburse such business concerns for such continued payments. Directs the Secretary to make transitional assistance payments to employees upon their request whenever a business concern fails to make such payments. Provides that the amount of such payments shall then be owed, with interest, to the United States by such business concern. Requires such business concerns to offer employees who suffer an employment loss any available employment, with equivalent wages and benefits, at any establishment of such business concerns for a three-year period after such employment loss. Sets forth such former employees' rights to credits and benefits in employee benefit plans and such business concerns' liability for payments to such plans. Stipulates that specified violations shall be deemed violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for which civil actions may be brought. Directs the Secretary to implement a comprehensive assistance program (including existing or new programs of job training and job placement) for employees who suffer or may suffer an employment loss. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and implement retraining programs and to condition specified assistance to business concerns upon their implementation or assistance with such programs. Directs the Secretary to issue certificates of Federal procurement credit to business concerns which comply with this Act for appropriate periods if the Secretary finds that such assistance would provide additional employment opportunities through the cooperating concerns. Sets forth conditions of eligibility for assistance of business concerns and certain employers or cooperative associations of employees. Authorizes the Secretary to provide specified forms of such assistance, giving priority to those forms which enable employees to continue at their present establishment. Sets forth criminal and civil violations and penalties. Enumerates violations of employees' rights and remedies for such violations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) recover overpayments of specified Federal assistance to employees obtained through a knowing deception; (2) maintain specified operating reserves; and (3) record mortgage security on specified loans. Sets forth general powers of the Secretary in carrying out this Act. Directs the Secretary to implement this Act through the National Employment Priorities Administration. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate any function, power or duty under this Act to the Administrator of the National Employment Priorities Administration. Establishes the National Employment Priorities Administration in the Department of Labor to: (1) perform such delegated functions, powers and duties; (2) conduct research on the relationship between unemployment and changes of business operations; and (3) identify services and products which may profitably be provided by business concerns receiving specified assistance. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
