Subjects specified non-fishing vessels above 15 gross tons to the manning and personnel qualification regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Expands the scope of the authority of the Secretary for licensing and classifying mates, engineers, pilots, and other employees of specified vessels, and increases from $100 to $500 per offense the civil penalty for employment of unlicensed personnel. Redefines the term \"passenger-carrying vessel\" for purposes of such laws."
