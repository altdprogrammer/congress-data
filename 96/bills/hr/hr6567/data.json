    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-02-21", 
    "text": "Atomic Energy Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a site permit for approval of a site for nuclear power facilities upon the application of any person, notwithstanding the fact that no construction permit for any such facility has been filed. Sets forth procedures and criteria for such application approval and specifies the information to be included in such application. Authorizes the renewal of such site permits between 18 and 48 months prior to the expiration of the permit validity period. Authorizes any applicant for a construction permit for nuclear facilities to be located on a site approved pursuant to this Act to prepare such site for construction as the Commission may determine to be permissible, but at the risk of the applicant and subject to modification, suspension, or revocation by the Commission at any time. Limits safety-related construction activities to a period of one year unless otherwise extended by the Commission. Authorizes the Commission to approve any standardized nuclear facility design or subsystem design by rule or regulation, notwithstanding the fact that no construction permit application has been filed with the Commission. States that such approval shall be deemed \"licenses\" for the purposes of the such Act and shall be valid for a period of ten years. Authorizes the Commission to consider amendments to a design approval and to require modification of such design only upon a finding that such modification will result in substantial improvement to public health and safety, or to the common defense and security, and that the costs are justified. Makes final, conclusive, and binding on the Commission all determinations made by a State agency having jurisdiction over nuclear facility siting or licensing, or by the governing body of a nonregulated electric utility, of (1) the public need and convenience for additional electrical energy and/or (2) the choice of nuclear fuel over other primary energy options. Prohibits the review of such determinations and the consideration of alternatives to such determinations if public hearings were held in accordance with administrative procedures similar to procedures of the Commission applicable to such determinations. Provides that, upon a finding by the Commission that a facility has been constructed and will operate in conformity with the operating license application, the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and Commission rules and regulations, the Commission shall issue an operating license to the applicant, unless good cause is shown why the granting of such license would not be in accordance with such Act. Sets forth requirements relating to the construction of a facility in accordance with Commission rules and regulations and/or designs previously approved in accordance with this Act, subject to the Commission's requirements as to conformity with rules and regulatory standards promulgated subsequent to the date of docketing of the construction permit application. Designates the Commission as the lead agency for consideration of all applications made to the Federal Government for civilian nuclear powerplant siting and construction licenses and for coordination of all Federal responsibility for such licenses."
