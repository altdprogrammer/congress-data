    "text": "Priority Energy Project Act of 1979 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to provide for a coordinated, simplified, and prompt process for Federal approval of nonnuclear energy facilities which are determined to be in the national interest. Authorizes the President to establish an Energy Mobilization Board to be composed of members appointed by the President. Sets forth the general duties and powers of such Board. Stipulates that any action by the Board shall not be considered as a \"major Federal action\" for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Directs the Board to designate Priority Energy Projects based on specified criteria and to publish a Project Decision Schedule containing deadlines for all Federal actions relating to such projects. Authorizes waivers of Federal, State, or local law upon the Board's determination that any Federal, State, or local time requirement for agency action is unreasonable and would impede the making of any agency decision. Specifies the procedure for obtaining such waivers. Limits judicial review to cases of absolute necessity involving alleged denial of rights under the United States Constitution or violations of statutory jurisdiction, authority, limitations, or rights. Sets time limits for filing claims arising out of actions taken pursuant to this Act, and bars any claims filed thereafter. Stipulates that such claims shall be brought in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the Priority Energy Project would be located, and grants exclusive original jurisdiction to such court in such matters. Directs such court to give precedence to such matters over all other matters on the court's docket, to the greatest extent practicable. Authorizes the Supreme Court, exclusively, to review interlocutory judgments or orders of the court of appeals pursuant to this title, and directs the Supreme Court to give precedence to such matters. Terminates the Board's authority to designate priority projects on September 30, 1985. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 to carry out this Act."
