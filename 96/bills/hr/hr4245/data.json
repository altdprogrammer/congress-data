    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-05-30", 
    "text": "National Alcohol Fuel and Farm Commodity Production Act of 1979 - Amends the Rural Development Act of 1972 to replace the current program of loan guarantees for pilot project production of industrial hydrocarbons from agricultural commodities with a program under which the Secretary of Agriculture may guarantee payment of 50 percent of loans made by private lenders to persons constructing and maintaining plants for the production of fuel alcohol derived from agricultural commodities. Authorizes the Secretary to sell such commodities to such loan recipients and to acquire and use distilled dried grains plus solubles (DDGS) from them. Specifies conditions for such loan guarantees and sets the maximum cumulative total of outstanding principal and interest during the period from October 1, 1979, through September 30, 1984, at $600,000,000. Establishes in the Treasury of the United States the Alcohol Fuel Plant Loan Guarantee Fund, and authorizes the appropriation of $60,000,000 for deposit in such Fund for fiscal year 1980. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set the loan level for corn at $2.10 per bushel, and the established price for the 1982 crop at $2.75 per bushel. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the uses and marketing of the byproducts resulting from the production of alcohol fuel, including, if appropriate, a market promotion program identifying the foreign markets for such byproducts for human consumption."
