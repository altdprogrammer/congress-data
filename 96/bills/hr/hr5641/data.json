Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make energy development and conservation actions grants to cities, urban counties, and Indian tribes to help alleviate physical and economic deterioration and promote energy development and conservation by subsidizing the rehabilitation, expansion, and development of feasible energy supply or conservation systems of proven technology, such as district heating, geothermal projects, industrial cogeneration, municipal solid waste heat recovery, small head hydropower, or other energy conserving systems or technologies. Stipulates that such grants shall be made only to those cities, counties, and Indian tribes which have provided low-and-moderate income housing and equal opportunity in housing and employment for low-and-moderate income persons and minority group members. Sets forth application procedures and criteria for selecting grant recipients. Directs the Secretary to coordinate such grant program with other agency programs, and to review and audit grant recipients."
