Stipulates that such information shall remain confidential and be used only for the purpose of verifying incomes in order to determine eligibility of families for benefits. States that the contract between the Secretary and the owner of low-income housing units shall provide that the responsibility of selection of tenants and termination of tenancy shall be assumed by the owner except that a public housing agent shall verify and review incomes in accordance with this Act."
