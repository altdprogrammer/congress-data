Defines \"qualified transfer for consumption\" as any transfer to a child of the transferor under the age of 21, or any other resident of the transferor's household, to pay current educational, medical, dental, food, clothing, or maintenance of living accommodations costs. Prohibits the transferee from acquiring any property which will retain significant value after one year from such transfer."
