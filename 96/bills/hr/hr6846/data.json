Requires the Attorney General to perform periodic evaluations of the overall efficiency of Department programs and supporting programs funded under this Act, to be made available to the Congressional Judiciary and other appropriate committees. Directs the Attorney General to develop comprehensive standards for holding and detention facilities operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Requires such standards to be submitted to the Judiciary Committees and to take effect within 60 days of enactment. Directs the Attorney General to evaluate the facilities and policies within one year of enactment and take action to ensure compliance.
