    "text": "Federal Assistance Paperwork Reduction Act - Title I: Administration of Generally Applicable Federal Assistance Requirements - Adds a new title to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968. Defines \"generally applicable requirements\" as requirements which are placed on assistance recipients by Federal legislation or administrative rules and regulations, and which apply to two or more assistance programs. Directs the President to designate Federal agencies to establish standard rules and regulations for, and to report on the implementation of generally applicable requirements in the areas of: (1) labor practices; (2) equal employment opportunity; (3) public employee standards; (4) equal services requirements based on prohibitions of discrimination; (5) access to government information; (6) citizen participation; (7) environmental protection; (8) relocation and real property acquisition; and (9) procurement standards when such requirements are part of a Federal assistance program. Directs Federal departments and agencies to comply with those rules within 180 days after such a rule is issued. Creates the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (OIA) to: (1) monitor the compliance efforts of Federal departments and agencies under this Act; and (2) oversee the operations of the designated agencies. Title II: Advance Appropriations - Amends the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 and the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 to provide for multi-year funding of Federal financial assistance programs. Title III: Joint Funding Simplification - Amends the Joint Funding Simplification Act of 1974 to require Federal agencies to take specified measures previously authorized by such Act to provide for joint funding by and management of Federal assistance programs which have common interests. Title IV: Administration of Financial Assistance to the States - Requires Federal agencies to provide the officials of a State or local government receiving Federal assistance with information concerning the amount, purpose, and impact of that assistance. Directs the OIA to develop the system of providing such information and to oversee agency compliance with this title. Authorizes Congress to include in Federal assistance legislation a provision which prohibits a State or local government from using Federal assistance to replace funding previously provided by that government unless that government is determined to be in fiscal distress."
