Allows the Civil Aeronautics Board to require air carriers which have terminated or reduced their service below such level between January 1, 1979, and the enactment of this Act, to provide essential air transportation services to such a point until January 1, 1982. Requires the Board to compensate any air carrier for losses incurred in complying with this Act. Directs the Board by March 1, 1982, to prepare and submit to Congress a report setting forth data on the number of persons and the type and weight of property transported by certificated air carriers providing service pursuant to this Act and to any large air traffic hub."
