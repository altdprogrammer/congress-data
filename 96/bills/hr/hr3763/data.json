    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to change the duties and authority of the Administrator of such Office. Directs the Administrator to: (1) provide leadership in the development of Federal procurement policy; (2) coordinate programs to improve the quality and performance of procurement personnel; (3) develop a uniform procurement system which includes uniform policies, regulations, procedures, and forms to be used for the procurement of property and services by executive agencies and by recipients of Federal grants or assistance; and (4) develop a central management system consisting of the Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, and the procurement offices of executive agencies to implement such procurement system. Lists other functions of the Administrator which include: (1) determining whether recommendations of the Commission on Government Procurement (CGP) should be completed, amended, or rejected; (2) developing standard contracts and contract language for Government procurements; and (3) directing formulation of executive branch positions on legislation relating to procurement. Establishes, within the Office, the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) through which the Administrator shall: (1) promote and conduct research in procurement policies; and (2) promote and recommend programs of the Office of Personnel Management and executive agencies for recruitment, training, and evaluation of procurement personnel. Authorizes the Administrator, until the uniform procurement system is implemented, to issue policies to ensure that procurement measures promulgated by executive agencies are consistent with the development of such system. Prohibits the issuance of any final regulation of an executive agency during a three year period unless the Director of the Office of Management and Budget certifies that such regulation is not inconsistent with established policies. Declares that nothing in this Act is to: (1) affect the authorities or responsibilities under the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949 for procurement of automatic data processing and telecommunications equipment and services, or of real property; or (2) limit the authority or responsibilities of the Director. Requires the Administrator to submit to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act: (1) a proposal for such procurement system; (2) a report on the recommendations of the CGP; (3) recommended changes in procurement legislation; and (4) a proposal for the central management system. Authorizes the appropriation of $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983 to carry out the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that one-third of the funds appropriated for each fiscal year be made available to the FAI."
