Defines \"mortgage revenue bonds\" as bonds which are issued to provide funding for mortgages on owner-occupied residences. Permits a tax exclusion for interest earned on bonds which are issued to finance housing for veterans, as general revenue bonds, or for the financing of low- and moderate-income housing, or the rehabilitation of such housing. Limits the issuance of industrial development bonds for housing purposes to rental or cooperative housing."
