    "text": "Sunset Program Evaluation Act of 1979 - Title I: Authorizations of New Budget Authority - Requires Government programs to be evaluated pursuant to a specified schedule to determine whether each such program should be continued, terminated, or altered (sunset review). Prohibits the authorization of new budget authority for a period of more than six years. Exempts from the requirements of this Act specified programs such as interest on Federal debts, health care services, general retirement and disability payments, as well as litigation activities which have as their objectives the protection and implementation of civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and specified retirement pay and benefits. Prohibits the authorization of new budget authority for any program for which there has not been conducted a sunset review. Requires that the report accompanying such review contain specified information. Provides that before the Congress can appropriate funds for any program, after its first review date, there must be a specific authorization in law to support the appropriation. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in consultation with the Director of the Congressional Research Service, to compile a list of programs subject to a review date for which new budget authority was not authorized. Title II: Program Inventory - Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in cooperation with the Comptroller General and the Director of the Congressional Research Service, to compile an inventory of Federal programs and to submit a report thereof to Congress by July 1, 1981. Sets forth the contents of the inventory program, including the type of authorization provided for such programs' new budget authority; and the manner in which related program areas may be grouped for evaluation and review. Requires the congressional committees to review the program inventory and suggest revisions. Requires that the program inventory be revised at the end of each session of Congress, and that such revisions be reported to each House. Requires that periodic reports tabulate the progress of congressional action on bills and resolutions authorizing budget authority for programs in the inventory. Directs the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to submit periodic reports to the Congress on the adequacy of the functional and subfunctional categories for grouping programs of like missions or objectives. Title III: Program Evaluation - Requires each House of Congress to select from programs scheduled for sunset review in any given year a number of programs for comprehensive evaluation. Requires the President and each congressional committee to recommend such programs. Sets forth the criteria for the selection of programs and the procedures for such evaluation. Stipulates that each evaluation include specified information including an assessment of the effectiveness of each program and an identification of any duplicative programs. Permits congressional committees which have jurisdiction over common programs to conduct a joint evaluation of any such program. Requires each committee conducting an evaluation to submit to Congress a report on its findings during the session of Congress in which the review date for the program occurs. Title IV: Citizens' Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government - Establishes, as an independent instrumentality of the United States, the Citizens' Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government to conduct a nonpartisan study and investigation of the organization and methods of operation of all departments, agencies, independent instrumentalities, and other authorities of the executive branch of the Government, and to make such recommendations as it determines are necessary to promote economic, efficient and improved services in the transaction of public business. Requires the Commission to submit interim reports to the President and the Congress, and to submit a final report with its findings and recommendations. Requires the Comptroller General to report once a year for two years after submission of the Commission's final report on the status of actions taken as a result of the report. Specifies the composition of the 18-member Commission and sets forth the duties and powers of the Commission. States that the Commission shall cease to exist 90 days after submission of its final report. Authorizes to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitations, $12,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Title. Title V: Miscellaneous - Amends the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 to permit the committees of Congress to obtain from the agencies of the Government estimates or requests for appropriations, or requests for increases in an item of any such estimate or request, and recommendations as to how the revenue needs of the Government should be met. Declares that nothing shall require the public disclosure of records which are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order, or which are otherwise specifically protected by law. Provides that the committees of the Senate or the House of Representatives shall not be required to publicly disclose any such records, except as otherwise provided by the rules of either House. Sets forth administrative procedures and requirements. Requires the Comptroller General to furnish Congress with the results of prior audits and reviews of programs being reviewed under this Act. Stipulates that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to specified agencies until January 1, 1989."
