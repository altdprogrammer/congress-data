Eliminates the provision which allows a pension plan, which makes certain elections ineffective if the participant dies within two years, to be treated as satisfying the joint and survivor requirements if certain other conditions are met. Sets forth additional joint and survivor requirements, including that: (1) each participant in the plan who is married shall be treated as having elected the qualified joint and survivor annuity form; (2) such election may be revoked and a new election of a qualified joint and survivor annuity form made only (A) during a specified period, (B) by the participant and spouse jointly and in writing, and (C) after they receive a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the annuity and the effect of an election or revocation; and (3) specified notice requirements are met."
