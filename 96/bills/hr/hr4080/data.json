Allows a five percent credit for individuals who first enlist in the Armed Forces after May 15, 1979, serve on active duty for a continuous period of at least two years, and receive an honorable discharge. Allows a ten percent credit for individuals who serve for a continuous period of more than four years. Excludes service in a reserve component of the Armed Forces from consideration for the credit. Permits an individual who reenlists in the Armed Forces to claim a credit for enlistment if such individual's prior enlistment ended five years before the date of his or her present enlistment and such individual received an honorable discharge for each prior enlistment."
