    "text": "Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1980 to carry out the provisions of such Act with respect to: (1) the regulation of and research pertaining to ocean dumping; and (2) the acquisition, development, and operation of marine sanctuaries. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) conduct research to determine means of ending the dumping into ocean waters of material unreasonably degrading the marine environment; and (2) promote the coordination of, and assist appropriate public and private entities in the conduct of, such research. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue necessary and reasonable regulations to implement the terms of the designation of marine sanctuaries and to provide that all permits, licenses, and other authorizations issued pursuant to any other authority shall be valid unless otherwise provided for by any marine sanctuary regulations. Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to conduct such enforcement activities as are necessary and reasonable to carry out the designation of marine sanctuaries. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to transmit to the Congress a marine sanctuary designation at the time of its publication. Sets forth the form of concurrent resolution to be used by the Congress to disapprove all or part of a designation. Authorizes the issuance of limited permits for research involving the dumping of industrial waste into ocean waters if it is determined that: (1) the proposed dumping is necessary to conduct research; (2) the dumping will have minimal adverse impact; and (3) the potential benefits of such research will outweigh any such adverse impact. Requires a Federal agency which desires to dump material into the ocean from a location in certain foreign countries to obtain the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency before applying to that foreign country for an ocean dumping permit. Includes waters of Long Island Sound within the definition of \"ocean waters\" for purposes of such Act."
