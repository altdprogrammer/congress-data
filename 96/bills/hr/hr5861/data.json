    "date": "1979-11-09", 
    "text": "Reverse Freedom of Information Litigation Act - Amends the Freedom of Information Act to require each Federal agency to promulgate regulations by which: (1) the agency shall notify a person who has submitted information to the agency (submitter) of any request, with specified exceptions, for the disclosure of such information; and (2) the submitter may present written arguments regarding such request. Directs each agency to notify the submitter of: (1) its decision regarding such request; and (2) the submitter's right to appeal a decision to disclose such information to the head of the agency. Prohibits an agency, upon deciding to honor such a request, from disclosing the requested information for ten days after notifying any submitter who objected to such disclosure of such decision. Grants the United States district courts jurisdiction, on complaint of a submitter, to enjoin an agency from disclosing information. Requires any agency which is the subject of a complaint to notify: (1) an individual requesting information of any complaint seeking the withholding of such information; and (2) a submitter about any complaint seeking the disclosure of information. Specifies the jurisdiction of the courts with respect to the parties to actions based on such complaints. Permits the defendant in such an action to intervene or to be joined in such action. Directs such a court, in an action in which the complainant seeks the withholding of records, to review the record of the agency proceeding and to uphold the record unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law."
