Authorizes the Secretary to engage in feasibility studies relating to: (1) enlarging Shasta Dam and Reservoir, California, or constructing a replacement dam on the Sacramento River; and (2) the use of the Sacramento River for conveying water from such enlarged dam. Requires participation by the State of California in such studies and their costs. Authorizes the Secretary to revise the feasibility study of the Kellogg Unit, California. Requires the Secretary to fully describe all potential impacts resulting from the construction or operation of the: (1) Contra Costa County Water District Canal water intake relocation; (2) Los Vaqueros Dam pump-generating plant; and (3) Kellogg Unit. Requires the Secretary to make recommendations to Congress for assuring that the construction and operation of such projects does not result in the deterioration of the water quality and ecology of the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta or the San Francisco Bay estuarine system. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into new negotiated concession agreements with the present concessionaires at Lake Berryessa, California. Sets forth conditions to such agreement. Specifies that all permanent facilities placed by the concessionaries in the seven resorts at Lake Berryessa shall be considered the property of the respective current concessionaries. Stipulates that at the option of the Secretary, the United States may require that such permanent facilities not be removed from the concession areas, and instead, pay fair value for such facilities or, if a new concessionaire assumes operation of the concession, require that new concessionaire to pay fair value for the permanent facilities to the existing concessionaire. Amends the Reclamation Project Authorization Act of 1972 to require that the closed basin division of the San Luis Valley Project in Colorado be constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the engineering plans set out in the report of the Secretary of the Interior on this project, as modified by the plans shown in the Definite Plan Report on the Water and Power Resources Service, dated November 1979. Requires the Secretary to operate such project in a manner that will not cause the water table available for any irrigation or domestic wells in existence outside the project boundary prior to project construction to drop more than two feet. Increases the authorization for the construction of such project. Designates the Curecanti Storage Unit, Colorado, of the Colorado River Storage Project as the Wayne N. Aspinall Storage Unit. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide for the payment of rates under any contract entered into for water delivered from Federal reclamation projects in advance of delivery of such water on a bimonthly or monthly basis, as well as on an annual or semiannual basis. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to conduct a three year study of the feasibility of integrating a solar powerplant in Arizona, Nevada, and California into the Federal hydroelectric system. Amends the Colorado River Basin Project to prohibit any Federal official (presently, only the Secretary of the Interior) from undertaking reconnaissance studies of any plan for the importation of water into the Colorado River Basin from any other natural watershed outside of specified States. Amends the Reclamation Project Authorization Act of 1972 to increase the authorization of appropriations for the construction of the Brantley Dam project, New Mexico. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to engage in feasibility studies of the following salinity control proposals: (1) Lower Gunnison Basin unit, Glenwood-Dotsero Springs unit, Meeker Dome unit, and McElmo Creek unit all in the State of Colorado; (2) Uinta Basin unit, Dirty Devil River unit, Price-San Rafael Rivers unit, and La Verkin Springs unit all in the State of Utah; (3) Lower Virgin River unit in the States of Nevada and Arizona; and (4) Big Sandy River unit in the State of Wyoming.
