    "text": "Navajo and Hopi Settlement Amendments Act - Declares it to be: (1) the policy of the United States to oppose the forced relocation of Native Americans from their homeland; and (2) the purpose of this Act to stop the forced relocation of the Navajo and Hopi Indians and to reduce the expense of the Navajo and Hopi Settlement Act. Amends such Act to eliminate all provisions relating to the appointment of a Federal Mediator and tribal negotiating teams to agree on land settlement. Eliminates other provisions relating to: allotments in severalty to Paiute Indians now located on certain lands; a Navajo-Hopi Relocation Commission report on relocation; authorization of relocation; relocation housing payment of rental value by one tribe to another for post- partition use of lands; nonmandatory relocation of Federal employees; claims for damages to land; and the reduction of grazing livestock. Changes certain guidelines for the District Court for the District of Arizona in its final adjudication of the Navajo-Hopi land settlement case, Healing v. Jones. Directs the District Court to partition any lands in which the Navajo and Hopi tribes or Navajo or Hopi individuals have a joint or undivided interest to the tribe of which the customary user of such land is a member. Requires that the United States compensate the Navajo Tribe for certain lands partitioned to the Hopi Tribe. Designates certain Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offices to exercise jurisdiction over partitioned lands. Stipulates that tribal ordinances shall apply to land partitioned to such tribe. Vacates any judgment, order, or decree issued by the District Court upon referral and recommendations from the former negotiating teams and Mediator. Allows individuals or families relocated under such Act to return to the land they formerly occupied. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide all necessary assistance for such return."
