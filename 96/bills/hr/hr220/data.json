    "text": "States that in the event a Federal employee presiding over the reception of evidence in any agency hearing is unavailable to render the initial decision in such matter, the decision may be made by an employee qualified to preside at such hearing. States that the requirement that a presiding employee make the initial decision in a given case shall not apply to applications for initial licenses, decisions concerning the validity of rates, or other specified matters pertaining to public utilities, or matters concerning the agency itself. Prohibits such employee from consulting any person or party on a fact in issue at the hearing unless all parties have been given notice and an opportunity to participate in such consultation. Prohibits any employee who performs investigative or prosecuting functions for an agency in a case from participating in the agency's decisions concerning such case. Stipulates that an employee shall not be considered to be participating in the decision of a ratemaking proceeding solely by virtue of his or her general organizational or supervisory responsibility for such proceeding."
