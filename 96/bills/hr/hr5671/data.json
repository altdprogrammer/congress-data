Requires the President to determine when a snowstorm became sufficiently severe to warrant emergency or major disaster designation. Directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prescribe standards to be used in determining whether a snowstorm shall be declared an emergency or a major disaster. Permits the President to declare an emergency or major disaster even if all the standards are not met. Prohibits taking into account the extent of assistance previously granted to a State when deciding whether to declare an emergency or major disaster. Prohibits making grants to update State disaster assistance plans to any State normally receiving heavy snowfall unless such State has completed a snow preparedness plan satisfactory to the President."
