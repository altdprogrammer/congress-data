    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #634 (222-184)) Social Welfare Reform Amendments of 1979 - =Title I: Aid to Families with Dependent Children; Assistance to Meet Emergency Needs; Earned Income Credit= - Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, hereinafter AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide that in determining the income and resources of individuals claiming AFDC the following shall be disregarded in the case of any child or relative receiving AFDC: (1) the first $70 per month of earned income; (2) 20 percent of any self-employment earnings; (3) one-third of the amount of earned income not disregarded under clauses (1) or (2); (4) up to $160 per month in child care or as adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of such care; and (5) a certain amount of the total income as determined by a formula set forth in this Act. Defines the term \"income\" for purposes of part A to include all income from whatever source. Specifies items which shall be excluded from income, including assistance which is based on need and is furnished by a State in order to augment AFDC. Amends the AFDC program to permit States to pay reduced benefits in the case of an AFDC child living with a relative who is not legally responsible for such child by pro-rating the costs of shelter and utilities for such child among household members. Repeals provisions of part A which: (1) require AFDC payments to be reduced by any unemployment compensation received by a child's parent; (2) require that training incentives and income derived from a special work project under the Work Incentive Program (WIN) be disregarded in determining eligibility under part A based on income; and (3) require that in determining an individual's needs, the additional expenses attributable to participation in the WIN program shall be taken into account. Provides for the payment of reasonable work expenses, in addition to the incentive payment already authorized, under the WIN program. Excludes such work expenses and incentive payments from income under any Federal or federally assisted program. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prescribe the types and maximum allowable amounts of financial resources which an eligible AFDC family may own. Stipulates that such maximum may be not less than $750 nor more than $1,750. Excludes from such resources, among other things: (1) one licensed vehicle but only such portion of the fair market value that is below $4,500; (2) a home; (3) burial plots; (4) household goods and personal effects; and (5) resources of which the cash value cannot be readily realized. Prohibits the imposition of a lien against the property of any individual because of AFDC aid received. Prohibits an individual from receiving AFDC benefits for specified periods if within 24 months of applying for benefits such individual disposed of property having an uncompensated value of more than $3,000 and which, if retained, would have caused such individual to be ineligible for benefits. Substitutes the term \"unemployed parent\" for the term \"unemployed father\". Defines \"unemployment\" to mean earnings of less than $500 per month. Repeals the requirement, in the case of a dependent child of an unemployed parent, that such parent must have been employed for at least six out of 13 work period quarters in the period ending one year prior to applying for benefits. Stipulates that only the principle earner of a family need register for manpower services, training, and employment as a condition of eligibility for AFDC, but that aid shall not be denied if the principal earner is not registered and the other parent is registered. Includes within the definition of AFDC, payments to a pregnant woman who, following a child's birth, would become eligible for AFDC. Requires a State plan of AFDC to cover the caretaker relative of a dependent child with whom such child is living, and both the mother and father if the child is deprived by reason of the incapacity or unemployment of a parent. Sets forth a formula for determining monthly AFDC payments based in part on a family's monthly cash needs standard or monthly payment standard. Directs each State to establish standards for a family with dependent children such that, for any family with no income other than AFDC payments each of the standards, when added to the value of the monthly allotment of food stamp coupons, will equal an amount that is not less than 60 percent, increasing to 65 percent on October 1, 1981, of the income poverty guidelines for a family with the same number of members as such family. Permits a a State to vary its monthly cash needs standard so as to take into account differences in the cost of living in different geographical regions of the State. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the desirability and feasibility of: (1) raising the minimum benefit amount under the AFDC program; and (2) alternatives to the existing matching formulas under the AFDC program. Defines the term \"income poverty guidelines.\" Provides for the adjustment of such guidelines in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price Index. Directs the Secretary to set forth the rights and responsibilities of AFDC applicants and recipients including, among others: (1) requiring a State to determine eligibility within 30 days of receiving an application; (2) the right of any family to a hearing to protest an agency determination; and (3) requiring a State to replace a lost or stolen check within five days. Sets forth State plan requirement concerning: (1) the effective date of the application; (2) the period for determination of eligibility; (3) the time of the month at which payment must be made; and (4) an annual review of eligibility. Permits an individual to refuse employment yet remain eligible for AFDC if acceptance of such employment would result in a reduction of such individual's income.

Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the Federal payment to a State, according to a specified formula, for AFDC payments in the case of a child deprived of parental support due to: (1) the death, absence, or incapacity of a parent; or (2) the unemployment of a parent. Directs the Secretary to pay to a State for fiscal years 1982-1986 an amount equal to the excess of the State's allowable expenditures for AFDC if such expenditures exceed 95 percent of the States fiscal liability base. Provides for a declining proportion of the amount paid in FY 1986 to be paid to a State for FY's 1987 through 1989. Defines the terms \"allowable expenditures for AFDC\" and \"fiscal liability base.\" Permits a State to increase its allowable expenditures for AFDC according to guidelines set forth in this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to issue regulations pertaining to the administration of the aid to families with dependent children program.

Requires a State AFDC plan to provide for: (1) the recovery of aid incorrectly paid; (2) the payment of aid incorrectly denied or underpaid; and (3) the cooperation of all State agencies administering AFDC plans in reviewing case records and providing information to identify AFDC recipients who are receiving AFDC benefits in more than one State and benefits under any other federally supported program.

States that a husband and wife who are living in the same medical care facility shall be considered to be living apart for the purposes of title XVI. Provides, with stated exceptions, that where an individual eligible for SSI is in a medical care facility, such individual's benefits for the period ending with the third consecutive month throughout which he or she is in such facility shall be determined as though he or she were continuing to reside outside the facility under the same conditions as prior to the entrance of such individual to the facility. Includes remuneration received for services performed in a sheltered workshop or work activities center as earned income, for the purpose of determining eligibility under title XVI based on income. Excludes a burial plot, certain burial expenses, and certain unearned income received in the form of real or personal property from the resources of an individual when determining the eligibility of such individual for SSI.

Extends, under title XVI, until October 1, 1982, the program of Federal payments to States for costs incurred in carrying out a State plan of services for disabled children who receive SSI benefits. Provides that for the purpose of determining resources and benefits for an SSI applicant or recipient living in another's household such applicant or recipient shall be considered to be living in his or her own household if such individual has contributed a certain share towards the expenses of such other person's household. Provides that when an individual who was represented by an attorney obtains a favorable decision in a claim for past due SSI benefits, the court may allow as part of the judgment a fee for such representation not to exceed 25 percent of such benefits. Provides that eligibility and the benefit amount for SSI will be determined on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for the prompt replacement of SSI benefit checks which have been lost, stolen, destroyed or not delivered within two mail delivery days following the day regularly designated for delivery.
