    "text": "Fuel Use Regulatory Reform Act of 1980 - Amends the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to require the Secretary of Energy to grant a permanent or a temporary exemption allowing a new electric power plant or a new major fuel-burning installation to use petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source to petitioners who certify that the Federal, State or local environmental law prevents, either permanently or temporarily, compliance with prohibitions against such use of petroleum or natural gas. Directs the Secretary to grant a temporary or a permanent exemption to an existing electric powerplant or major fuel-burning installation if the petitioner certifies that Federal State or local environmental law prevents, either temporarily or permanently, compliance with prohibitions of such use of petroleum or natural gas at such plant or installation. Requires the Secretary to grant a permanent exemption for the use of natural gas or petroleum in a new major fuel-burning installation if petitioner certifies that the amount of such fuels to be used as a primary energy source in a fuel mixture will not exceed 25 percent. Directs the Secretary to base any finding that an existing installation has a coal or alternate fuel capability on a consideration of the installation's entire energy generating system. Requires the terms and conditions of any exemption to a new or existing facility to apply only to the unit for which the petition is filed. Permits the Secretary to require only information directly related to the unit for which an exemption under this Act is sought. Requires information obtained under this Act to be treated confidentially."
