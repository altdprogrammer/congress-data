Mandates that such schedules require final compliance with each contaminant level and treatment technique requirement for which such interim variance was granted by a specified date. Sets such date at: (1) the later of January 1, 1988, or seven years after such requirement takes effect; or (2) in cases where the public water system has entered into an enforceable agreement to become part of a regional public water system, the later of January 1, 1992, or nine years after such requirement takes effect. Permits a State with primary enforcement responsibility to determine that the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means need not be constructed and in place before a variance may be granted."
