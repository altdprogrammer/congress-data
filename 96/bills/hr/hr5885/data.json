    "text": "Senior Cryptologic Executive Service Act of 1979 - Title I: Senior Cryptologic Executive Service - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish within the National Security Agency a Senior Cryptologic Executive Service (Service) comparable to the Senior Executive Service created pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Authorizes the Director of the Agency: (1) to adopt such administrative and pay provisions of such Act as necessary to administer the Service; and (2) to appoint individuals to the Service without regard to civil service laws. Sets forth provisions governing the awarding of rank, employee sabbaticals, accrual of annual leave, and employee eligibility for civil service annuities for appointees to the Service which are similar to provisions of such Act governing members of the Senior Executive Service. Directs the Agency to submit to specified congressional committees during each odd-numbered fiscal year a report on the service which includes: (1) the percentage of senior executives at each pay rate; (2) the amount and distribution of performance awards paid during the preceding year; and (3) the number of individuals removed from the Service for unsatisfactory performance. Title II: Merit Pay and Cash Awards - Authorizes the Director to establish a merit pay and cash awards system for employees of the Agency."
