Requires that members of the United States Secret Service Division who are appointed from the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police force prior to January 1, 1972, and assigned duties directly relating to the protection of the President, receive credit for prior service with the D.C. police force, the U.S. Park Police force, or the Executive Protective Service toward the ten years of Secret Service duty which entitles such a member to elect coverage by the District of Columbia's retirement system."
