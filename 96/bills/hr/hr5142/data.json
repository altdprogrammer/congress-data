    "text": "Travel Expense Amendments Act of 1979 - Requires the Administrator of General Services to conduct an annual survey of expenses of travel to the various areas of the continental United States and to submit the survey results to Congress. States that such travel expenses shall be the per diem allowances provided to Federal employees for official travel to such areas unless either House of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving the survey results within 30 days after submission. Eliminates the current maximum limitations on: (1) the amount of reimbursement an employee may receive for the actual and necessary expenses of official travel exceeding such per diem allowance; and (2) the mileage allowance to which an employee is entitled for use of his or her privately owned vehicle for official business."
