    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service with amendment, H. Rept. 96-114 (Part I)) Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to revise certain financial disclosure requirements for Federal employees. Exempts persons who are not expected to perform the duties of office for more than 60 days per year from provisions requiring new or terminated employees to file financial disclosure reports. Permits the House and the Senate to require a legislative branch employee, whose employment is terminated prior to the annual reporting date, to file a report covering such individual's period of employment. Authorizes the appropriate committees of Congress, the Judicial Ethics Committee, and the Office of Government Ethics to waive any reporting requirement under such Act for employees performing their duties less than 130 days a year when such disclosure is deemed not necessary. States that gifts or reimbursements received in a period when the reporting individual was not a Federal employee need not be reported. Exempts certain gifts from inclusion in the aggregate amount of gifts from one source when a publicly available request for a waiver is granted. Requires a candidate for President, Vice President, or Member of Congress to file an annual disclosure report only until the election for such office takes place. Includes in a \"qualified blind trust\" for purposes of the Act any trust in which the trustee is an investment adviser. Prohibits any legislative branch, executive branch, or judicial branch report from being made available under the public disclosure provisions of such Act unless the person requesting disclosure has submitted a written application setting forth specified information about the applicant. Revises the definition of \"income\" for purposes of titles I, II, and III to allow an individual to elect to include net income derived from business. Makes certain technical and conforming changes in other disclosure provisions of such Act."
