    "date": "1979-03-19", 
    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable income tax credit equal to one-half the amount of health insurance premiums paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year for his medical care or that of his spouse or dependents. Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $250 for the taxable year. Eliminates the special income tax deduction for health insurance premiums (one-half of premiums paid not in excess of $150), but allows the deduction of such premiums along with other medical and dental expenses to the extent that they exceed three percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Reduces the amount of medical expenses allowable as a deduction by the amount allowable to the taxpayer as a credit for health insurance premium payments. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, or his delegate, to conduct a study of the health insurance premium credit every third year after the enactment of this Act and to report the findings to Congress."
