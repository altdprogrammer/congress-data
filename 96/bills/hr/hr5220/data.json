Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts, cooperative agreements, and other arrangements and to provide technical, financial, and related assistance for such purposes. Requires that non-Federal cooperators contribute at least 50 percent to projects established under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such purposes. Directs the Secretary to make annual reports to the Congress on such program, to make specified surveys, and to coordinate such reports and surveys with other specified comprehensive surveys, land management plans, and forest resource programs.
