    "text": "Court-Annexed Arbitration Act of 1979 - Directs a United States district court which has authorized by rule the use of arbitration under this Act to refer to arbitration any civil action pending before it if: (1) the parties consent to arbitration; or (2)(A) the action is based on a negotiable instrument or contract or is for personal injury or property damage, and (B) the relief sought is money damages not exceeding $100,000 (or a lesser amount which the court may set). Authorizes a court to except from arbitration, for good cause, individual cases which would otherwise be referred. Excludes from arbitration: (1) constitutional rights cases; (2) certain actions brought by the United States or against officials or employees of the United States for acts performed by such individuals acting within the outer perimeter of their official duties; and (3) certain civil rights actions. Authorizes district courts to certify and establish the amount of compensation for arbitrators. Sets forth arbitration procedures. Allows an arbitrator to admit any relevant and trustworthy evidence, with the Federal Rules of Evidence as a guide to admissibility. Provides that an arbitration award judgment shall have the same force and effect as a court judgment, except it shall not be appealable. Allows any party to demand a new trial in the district court within 30 days after the filing of the arbitration award with the court. Authorizes the court in such cases to allow the arbitrator's fees to be taxed as costs. Provides for the repeal of this Act effective five years from the date of enactment."
