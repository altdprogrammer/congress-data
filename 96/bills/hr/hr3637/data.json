Directs the President to request the International Coffee Council or the Executive Board to suspend coffee export quotas and take other appropriate action if it is determined that there has been an unwarranted increase in coffee prices due to the Agreement or market manipulation by two or more members of the International Coffee Organization. Requires the President to submit recommendations to Congress if the Council fails to take corrective action. Suspends the President's authority to implement the Agreement if members involved in market manipulation have failed to remedy the situation within a reasonable time. Requires the President to report annually to Congress concerning the Agreement."
