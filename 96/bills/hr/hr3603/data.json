    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-04-10", 
    "text": "Public Service System Act - Establishes within the executive branch an agency to be known as the Public Service System. Requires every citizen upon reaching 17 years of age to register with the local placement center of such System. Stipulates that individuals who become citizens between the ages of 17 and 25 shall be treated as having reached the age of 17 on the date of such individual's naturalization for purposes of this Act. Requires the Director of the System to establish a monthly random Public Service Lottery to select registrants to serve in the Public Service System. Requires individuals registered with the System to select a six-month period during the ages of 17 and 25 for inclusion in the monthly lotteries held during such period. Sets forth measures for including individuals in such lotteries who fail to select such a six-month period. Allows registrants to notify their local placement centers of a preference for either civilian, military, or military reserve service. Stipulates that individuals who are selected by the monthly lottery shall be assigned to the division of service for which they expressed a preference except under specified conditions. Sets forth exemptions and deferments from service in the Public Service System or participation in the Public Service Lottery. Sets forth procedures and proof requirements for exemptions based on conscientious opposition to such service. Sets forth appeal procedures regarding such exemptions and deferments. Stipulates that: (1) registrants assigned to civilian service shall serve for a period of 24 consecutive months; (2) registrants assigned to military service shall serve on active duty in one of the armed forces for 18 consecutive months with no further reserve obligation; and (3) registrants assigned to military reserve service shall serve on active training for six consecutive months and shall then serve in the reserves on an active status for 36 consecutive months. Makes all registrants who are not exempt or who do not have a deferral eligible for induction into the armed forces during any period of war declared by Congress. Requires each Federal agency to reserve a specified percentage of their employment positions for the employment of civilian service registrants under this Act. Authorizes the President to reduce such percentages or to exempt any Federal agency from such requirement if compliance would seriously impair the performance or responsibilities of such agency. Establishes a Civilian Placement Bureau within the System. Requires each Federal agency to notify the Administrator of such Bureau of its need for Public Service System personnel for the following month. Directs the Administrator to assign civilian service registrants who have been selected from the Public Service Lottery to the available positions in such agencies for which those registrants are most suitable. Requires the Secretary of Defense to notify the Director of the Service on a monthly basis of the number of registrants needed for the following month for active duty service in the armed forces and service in the Selected Reserve or Ready Reserve of the armed forces. Stipulates that registrants employed by a Federal agency in civilian service shall be compensated at a rate of pay established by the President that will provide only for their basic subsistence needs. Stipulates that such individuals shall not be considered Federal employees except in specified circumstances and shall not be subject to the provisions of law relating to hours of work, rates of compensation, leave, classification, employee discipline, termination, unemployment compensation, and Federal employee benefits. Stipulates, however, that such individuals shall have the same hours of work, vacation days, such leave, and annual leave as new Federal employees have. Stipulates that registrants serving in any armed force or reserve component shall be subject to the provisions of law applicable to the other members of such armed force or reserve including the provisions of law governing classifications and rates of pay. Sets forth the conditions under which an individual may be dismissed from civilian service in any Federal agency. Establishes within the Public Service System a Public Service Review Board to entertain appeals from individuals discharged from civilian service. Authorizes registrants to file an action in the appropriate district court regarding decisions of the Review Board. Repeals the Military Selective Service Act. Transfers the funds, powers, duties, and personnel of the Selective Service System to the Public Service System. Establishes criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly fail to register with the Public Service System."
