    "as": "House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment", 
    "date": "1979-10-26", 
    "text": "(House agreed to certain Senate amendments with an amendment) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to continue to designate certain highways on the Federal-aid primary system as mileage on part of the Interstate Highway System. Stipulates that, in the event that approval of a route on the Interstate System was withdrawn before November 6, 1978, the State involved shall not be required to refund to the Highway Trust Fund any sums paid to the State for intangible costs. Stipulates that in the case of interstate projects which are withdrawn on or after such date the State shall not be required to reimburse such Fund for the costs of construction items, materials, or rights-of-way if: (1) such items, materials, and rights-of-way were acquired before November 6, 1978; (2) by the withdrawal of approval date the Secretary of Transportation has not approved the project's environmental impact statement; and (3) such items, materials, or rights-of-way will be applied to an eligible transportation project, to a public conservation or recreation purpose, or to any other public purpose determined by the Secretary to be in the public interest under specified conditions. Includes as an eligible cost of construction any interest earned and payable on State or local government bonds which were issued for projects on January 1, 1978, on the Interstate Systems and which were converted to regularly funded projects after such date. Stipulates that any State's apportionment for Interstate System resurfacing, restoring, or rehabilitation projects shall continue to be available for expenditure in that State for a period of two years after the fiscal year for which such sums were apportioned. Allows the Secretary to use funds previously earmarked for bridge replacement or repair programs costing over $10,000,000 for projects which cost less under specified circumstances. Permits the transfer of discretionary bridge funds to a State's apportionment under the Federal-aid urban system program to repay funds obligated, between June 1, and July 31, 1979, for bridge projects which are eligible for funding under this Act. Increases the Federal share of the cost of training State and local highway department employees under the auspices of the National Highway Institute. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 to make the provision in such Act which prohibits highway signs solely using the metric system inapplicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to determine the extent of outstanding bonded indebtedness for each State for the construction of roads prior to June 29, 1956, which have been incorporated into the Interstate System. Directs the Secretary to determine a method of allocating bonded indebtedness between those portions on the System which are toll free and those which are not. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to make technical corrections in such Act. Changes the date on which a State must certify each year that it has a program for Interstate maintenance from October 1 to January 1. Provides the next apportionment of funds (previously the funds apportioned for that fiscal year) to a State may be reduced if such State fails to so certify or adequately maintain the Interstate System. Allows the expenditure of emergency relief funds for payment of the maintenance and operating expenses of ferryboats providing temporary substitute highway traffic service. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act to extend the reporting deadline for the National Alcohol Fuels Commission's study of the potential for alcohol fuels. Increases the authorization level for such Commission and provides that funds shall remain available until expended. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 to specify that the Highland Scenic Highway in West Virginia shall be maintained as part of the Monongahela National Forest. Permits the State of Indiana to: (1) issue bonds constituting a lien against the East-West Toll Road in northern Indiana (Interstate Route 80/90); and (2) continue collecting tolls along such route even after such bonds have been retired. Stipulates that the revenue received from such sources be used for: (1) the construction of additional interchanges on and the maintenance of such route; and (2) repayment to the United States for the amount of Federal-aid highway funds received for the construction of specified interchanges. Amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 to limit for a three-year period the licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over by-product material produced by an activity over which a State assumes or has assumed authority pursuant to an agreement with the Commission. Authorizes the Commission during such period to insure that specified standards, procedures, and requirements are implemented to the maximum extent practicable."
