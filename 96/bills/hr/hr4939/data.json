Requires any comparison, made for the purposes of this Act, of the risks involved in alternative scientific, technological, or related actions to include: (1) an evaluation of the risks to human health and life which would be incurred or increased by the proposed action or course of action in comparison with the risks which would be reduced or eliminated thereby; and (2) an evaluation of the risks to human health and life which would be incurred, increased, reduced, or eliminated as a consequence of the proposed action in comparison with the corresponding risks associated with the alternative action or actions. Requires the Office to submit to Congress, no later than September 30, 1980, a report on its activities and progress which shall specifically include: (1) a detailed statement of the findings and an evaluation of such findings and their significance; (2) an identification of all Federal laws and regulations where changes involving comparative risk assessments are needed; (3) recommendations for changes which ought to be made in the organizational structure of the various Federal agencies; (4) appropriate consideration of methods by which public understanding and appreciation of comparative risk assessments can be increased; and (5) such other matters as in its judgment will assure continuing progress toward achievement of the objectives of this Act."
