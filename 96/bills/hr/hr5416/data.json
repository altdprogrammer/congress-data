    "text": "Fisheries Advanced Technology Transfer Act of 1979 - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a study of the fish harvesting and processing techniques and technologies which are utilized in foreign nations and in the United States which can be used or adapted for use in harvesting or processing fish or fish products within the United States fisheries. Declares that such technologies and techniques may include, but are not limited to, those involving or related to fishing gear, processing equipment, vessels, harvesting methods, or processing methods. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to report the results of such study to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, within six months after the date of enactment of this Act. Permits organizations in the fishing industry and regional fishery development foundations to submit applications for funds to conduct projects which will enable such persons, foundations, and organizations to utilize the advanced technologies and techniques in commercial harvesting and processing of fish. Directs the Secretary, when considering such project applications, to take into account the extent to which: (1) a project addresses both the harvesting and processing of fish; (2) a project addresses problems common to more than one fishery, State, or region; (3) the project promotes the United States' efficient utilization of fishery resources within the United States fishery conservation zone; (4) the project minimizes costs and avoids unnecessary duplication; and (5) applicants are able to defray the cost of conducting a project by providing matching funds or in-kind contributions of equipment, labor, or services, including, but not limited to, boats, gear, and locations."
