    "text": "United States - Mexico Good Neighbor Employment Act of 1979 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Attorney General to establish a program for the non-immigrant admission of Mexican nationals as temporary workers in the United States. Provides that: (1) the Attorney General shall establish annual and monthly quotas for temporary worker visas based on the chronological order of application; (2) such temporary services or labor shall not exceed 180 days per year; (3) such visas shall not limit the geographic area or employment within which an alien may work unless specific restrictions are requested by the Secretary of Labor in order to protect domestic workers; (4) an alien who violates the 180-day visa limitation or any imposed geographic restriction shall be ineligible for another temporary visa for five years; and (5) an alien who enters the United States illegally shall be ineligible for obtaining a temporary work visa for ten years. Excludes such temporary Mexican workers from the definition of \"immigrant\" for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Includes such workers within the category of aliens whose non-immigrant status may not be adjusted to that of an immigrant. Prohibits the Attorney General from consenting to the reapplication for admission of any such workers whose 180-day limitation has been exhausted. Authorizes the Secretary of State to establish and expand United States Consulates in Mexico in order to implement such temporary worker program. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make the nature of such program known to Mexican nationals residing in the United States. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should establish with Mexico an advisory commission to advise the Attorney General with regard to such temporary worker program."
