    "text": "Radiation Control Act of 1979 - Gives the Environmental Protection Agency primary responsibility on behalf of the Federal government for: (1) compiling and assessing all available information on radiation from all sources, and disseminating the results to the public; (2) conducting and administering Federal or federally-supported radiation effects and assessment programs; (3) developing, issuing, and modifying regulations dealing with radiation exposure of the public and of workers; (4) monitoring, maintaining records of, and establishing allowable totals of radiation exposure; and (5) establishing an identifiable group to compile and analyze epidemiological information on the effects of radiation. Directs the Administrator of the Agency to: (1) establish the most likely statistical relation between a given exposure dose of each form of ionizing radiation and the consequent harmful effects therefrom; (2) exposure encountered for the public and for workers from each of specified sources; and (3) obtain the statistically expected effect upon the public and upon workers from each of individual types of sources within specified categories. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress specified reports and annual updates, summaries of which shall be made available for public information. Transfers to the Agency all functions and activities for which the Agency is given primary responsibility under this Act which are currently being exercised or conducted by other Federal agencies and officers, along with related powers, duties, personnel, and resources, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Directs the Administrator to keep the appropriate committees of Congress fully and currently informed of all activities under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
