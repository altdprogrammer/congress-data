Authorizes the Board to provide financial assistance to such projects in the form of loans or price subsidies, price guarantees, or purchase guarantees for products produced by such project, or to acquire stock or otherwise participate in the financing of such projects, or to undertake the project itself. Stipulates that such financial assistance may be provided only if it is not otherwise available. Sets forth other requirements for providing such assistance. Sets forth requirements regarding the composition of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Sets forth the general authority of the Corporation and restrictions thereon.
