    "text": "Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a specified segment of the American River in California as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Specifies that such river shall be designated as a recreational river and administered by the State of California, the county of Sacramento, and the city of Sacramento. Declares that nothing in this Act shall prevent, prohibit, or otherwise affect the operation and maintenance of flood control works associated with such segment. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make funds available to the State, or to the city and county, for the acquisition of lands or interests in land in any area within the river corridor designated by this Act. Requires the State or local authorities, or both, in order to receive such funds, to provide assurances that other areas within the river corridor will be adequately protected through other State and local action."
