Prohibits a refiner of motor fuel from operating a retail service station within one mile of any retail service station with which such refiner has a franchise relationship for a period of two years if such refiner is shown through adjudication to be unreasonably underselling competitors and for a period of five years for subsequent violations of such prohibition. Requires a refiner to comply with applicable provisions of law relating to franchise protection before such refiner converts a retail service station from a franchise relationship to operation by the refiner."
