    "text": "Prohibits the amount expended by all executive agencies for personal service contracts during any fiscal year from exceeding the total amount expended by all agencies during fiscal year 1977. Authorizes the President to increase such amount, not to exceed a specified limit, upon publishing a finding that: (1) such increase serves the public interest; (2) an increase is necessary to assure the good administration of the agency; and (3) the contracts involved are not being used to circumvent any personnel ceiling. Declares that such contract ceiling shall not apply during a time of war or a period of national emergency. Terminates such provisions on February 1, 1985. Amends the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to prohibit the number of civilian employees in the executive branch on September 30 of 1982, 1983, and 1984 from exceeding the number of such employees on September 30, 1977. Requires the Office of Personnel Management, by January 31, 1981, to transmit to each House of Congress a report which: (1) describes the utilization of temporary employees in each agency during fiscal year 1980; and (2) recommends ways to enforce personnel ceilings with respect to such employees."
