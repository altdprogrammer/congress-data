    "text": "Regulatory Flexibility Act - Requires Federal agencies: (1) to assess the costs of private information collection and compliance which are or would be imposed by existing or proposed agency rules; (2) to compare such impositions with the importance of the public policy achieved or to be achieved by such rules; and (3) to determine whether such rules should apply to the same extent to individuals and organizations of various sizes and resources. Requires, in the event that it is determined that such proposed rules will have a substantial effect on any significant number of small businesses, that such rules be submitted to the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Requires that such Office comment on the impact of such proposed rules on smaller enterprises. Requires such comments to be made public and available to Federal personnel responsible for reviewing such rules. Directs that proposed rules be issued in two or more parts when the analysis of such rules indicates the desirability of applying varying requirements for performance or reporting depending on the resources of the organization or individual required to comply with such rules."
