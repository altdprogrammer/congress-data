    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-05-14", 
    "text": "Powerplant Fuel Conservation Act of 1980 - Title I: Accelerated Fuel Conversions of Certain Powerplants - Prohibits the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source after the 90th day following the enactment of this Act by any powerplant capable of converting to coal or other alternate fuel, without express exemption approved by the Secretary of Energy. Provides a procedure for procuring a stay of such prohibition pending consideration of such exemption. Limits the duration of any exemption to: (1) five years after its approval; or (2) December 31, 1985, whichever is later. Directs the Secretary to make a grant to any owner or operator of any alternate fuel capable powerplant for up to 50 percent of any amounts paid or incurred after November 9, 1978, for the conversion of such powerplant from the use of petroleum to coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source. Disqualifies from eligibility for such a grant any powerplant for which an exemption is sought. Specifies grant application requirements. Excludes from the reasonable costs coverable by a grant any costs for real estate acquisition, or for facilities, equipment, or improvements which are not at the same site as the designated powerplant. Requires: (1) publication in the Federal Register of every such grant application upon receipt, with opportunity afforded for public comment; and (2) consultation by the Secretary with the Governor (or designee) of the State where the powerplant is located, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Conditions award of a grant upon assurances that the conversion of the powerplant involved will occur not later than December 31, 1985, or three years after grant approval. Prohibits payment of any grant funds to any State regulated utility unless the State regulatory authority has certified to the Secretary, and the Secretary is satisfied, that the base used for ratemaking purposes by such utility will be reduced by the amount of the grant. Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to any electric utility which owns or operates any existing electric powerplant using coal as a primary energy source, for any reasonable amounts paid or incurred after enactment for the design and installation of equipment and facilities for reducing the sulfur atmospheric pollutants emitted by such powerplant. Requires the Secretary to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency of any application for such a grant and authorizes approval if approval has been recommended by the Administrator. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of sulfur removal systems for which grants are made. Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to any person for up to 20 percent of the reasonable costs paid or incurred for the design and installation of equipment and facilities for reducing the sulfur content of coal committed for use in any powerplant. Prohibits recovery after December 31, 1985, of any costs incurred by an electric utility for petroleum or natural gas used for certain powerplants by use of an automatic adjustment clause in its rate schedule, without express exemption by the Secretary. Title II: Additional Incentives for Reduction of Powerplant Use of Petroleum and Natural Gas - Directs the Secretary to make a grant to any electric utility for reasonable costs incurred after enactment in carrying out an approved fuel displacement plan. Limits the amount of a utility's grant to its pro rata share of the total appropriation for such grants, determined according to the ratio of: (1) the utility's base period fuel usage to (2) the estimated base period fuel usage of all electric utilities. Keys the obligation of approved grant amounts to any utility to the fuel reduction target established in its fuel displacement plan, depending on the percentage by which such target meets or falls short of such utility's pro rata share of a national fuel reduction goal of 600,000 barrels per day of petroleum and natural gas. Makes available additional grant amounts for any excess of such pro rata share. Sets a maximum grant ceiling of $4.00 per barrel of petroleum or natural gas conserved under the utility's fuel displacement plan. Specifies application and reporting requirements. Sets a minimum grant funds pay-out schedule of five years. Provides for recapture by the United States of funds paid out to any utility failing to meet the fuel displacement target established in its fuel displacement plan. Sets the period beginning January 1, 1974, and ending December 31, 1978, as the base period for purposes of determining base period fuel usage. Specifies factors for appropriate adjustments to the base period fuel usage. Specifies general contents of any fuel displacement plan. Requires prior approval of any such plan by the appropriate State regulatory authority in the case of a State regulated electric utility before the Secretary may approve. States that such prior approval shall be deemed to satisfy any State or local requirement that construction or operation of a new powerplant is permissible only if such facility is demonstrated to be needed because of an increase in demand for power. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary, upon application by an owner or operator of an existing industrial manufacturing facility and after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to declare that such facility shall not be deemed a new facility for purposes of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 and the Clean Air Act by reason of any physical or operational change of such facility (not constituting construction) which results in a more efficient use of petroleum and natural gas as a primary energy source in such facility with no net increase in air pollution. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires every electric utility which consumed 250,000 barrels or more of petroleum or natural gas per year between January 1, 1974, and December 31, 1978, to prepare a study of its fuel usage containing a 15-year forecast of: (1) the estimated costs of continuing to use petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source; and (2) the total estimated cost of converting existing powerplants to coal or other alternate fuel use, constructing new plants using coal or other alternate fuel as a primary energy source, and implementing energy conservation programs to eliminate or reduce the use of petroleum and natural gas. Directs the Secretary to make a grant to any State agency which meets specified requirements of an Office of Consumer Services for the purpose of assisting consumers in making presentations directly related to the development and review of fuel displacement plans. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. Specifies circumstances under which funds appropriated for the Economic Regulatory Administration of the Department of Energy may be used for program administration relating to this Act. Limits the making of grants under this Act to capital costs. Requires final action on grant applications within six months after filing. Requires any grant under this Act to be made on the condition that the activity or project funded will be in compliance with applicable environmental requirements."
