Provides that such an individual shall be entitled to veterans' benefits if a military board of review makes an independent determination that such individual would have been awarded an upgraded discharge under specified generally applicable standards of review. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs should not promulgate or amend any regulation which would provide any special advantage to veterans who have received upgraded discharges under the Department of Defense's special discharge review program."
