Sets forth the terms and conditions of such extension, including a seven year limitation. Directs the Commissioner of Patents to issue a certificate of extension stating the fact and length of the extension and identifying the product or device and the use and the claim to which such extension is applicable. Makes such certificate a part of the original patent. Authorizes the Commissioner to revoke such extension if the person subject to the regulatory review period is convicted of a criminal violation for submitting false or misleading data in support of such application."
