    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1980-03-04", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #54 (89-3)) =Title I:= Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to extend until October 1, 1982, the program of Federal payments to States for costs incurred in carrying out a State plan of services for disabled children who receive SSI benefits. =Title II: Unemployment Compensation Provisions= - Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to eliminate the \"national trigger\" requirement that all States operate the extended benefits program whenever the national insured unemployment rate reached four and one-half percent or higher. Prohibits matching payments to a State for the first week of compensable unemployment in an individual's eligibility period, if the State law of such State provides for payment, at any time or under any circumstances, of regular compensation for the first week of otherwise compensable unemployment. Allows a State the option of setting the unemployment percentage at which specified optional State \"on\" and \"off\" indicators for extended benefit periods take effect in such State at five percent or any higher percentage determined by such State (formerly, simply five percent). Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to declare: (1) that specified requirements for approval of State laws relating to the reduction of unemployment benefits because of pension payments only apply in the case of a pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment under a plan maintained (or contributed to) by a base period or chargeable employer; and (2) that State law may provide limitations on the amount of any such reduction to take into account contributions made by the individual for the pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payments. Extends from 90 days to one year the minimum length of Federal service generally required to qualify ex-servicemen for federally-funded unemployment compensation payments. Amends title IX (Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Employment Security) of the Social Security Act to establish a Federal Employees Compensation Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Requires that the Account consist of: (1) funds appropriated to or transferred thereto; and (2) deposits by each Federal agency based on Federal service performed by its employees. Requires that moneys in the Account be available only for making specified payments to States. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) determine the amount of such deposits; (2) certify the required quarterly amount to the Secretary of the Treasury; (3) estimate yearly expenditures from, and funds available to, the Account; and (4) certify the amount of excess funds, whenever such expenditures and a reasonable contingency fund have been provided for. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) transfer such excess amount from the Account to the general fund of the Treasury; and (2) notify the Secretary of Labor as to the date and amount of any deposit made to the Account by any agency. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to assure sufficient sums available in the Account, at all times, to meet the expenditures authorized to be made from moneys therein. Transfers specified appropriations available for making payments to States to the Account. Provides that service performed by a citizen of the United States as an employee of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission shall be considered as 'employment' under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code requirement that States reduce the amount of unemployment compensation payable for any week by the amount of any pension, retirement pay, annuity, or other similar benefits received by an individual, to limit the application of such requirement to payments under a plan maintained or contributed to by a base period employer (any employer who paid wages on which the unemployment insurance eligibility of the claimant and the amount and duration of benefits is based) where services performed for such employer by the individual during the base period (or remuneration for such services) affects eligibility for, or increases the amount of, such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other payment. Permits State law to provide for limitation on the amount of any such reduction to take into account contributions made by the individual for the pension, retirement pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payments. Postpones the effective date of such requirement from March 31, 1980, to January 1, 1982. Stipulates that such amendments shall not be effective after the enactment of this Act. Requires a State law to extend an individual's period of eligibility for extended unemployment compensation benefits to any week beginning within two years after the last day of such individual's benefit year. Makes such requirement effective as of January 1, 1982. Stipulates that such requirement shall not be effective after the enactment of this Act. Prohibits the payment of more than two weeks of extended unemployment compensation benefits to an individual who has qualified for extended benefits in a State paying such benefits but then moves to a State not paying such benefits. =Title III: Provisions Relating to Medicare= - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to include rural health facilities of 50 beds or less within the definition of the term \"hospital.\" Makes special provision with respect to nursing services, health, fire, and safety requirements for such facilities. =Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit against the excise tax on domestic or imported distilled spirits, wines, and beer for each proof gallon of the wine content of distilled spirits containing wine. Sets the amount of such credit at the excess of $10.50 over the rate of the additional tax on such wine which would be imposed but for its removal to bonded premises. Specifies the points in time for determining allowance of such credit for domestic and for imported distilled spirits containing wine. Excludes from such credit: (1) any substance which has been subject to distillation at a distilled spirits plant after receipt in bond; and (2) wine containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume."
