Requires: (1) that the evacuation after December 31, 1978, was authorized by competent authority which was in response to political unrest or hostile acts, and that damage or loss resulted from such evacuation; or (2) that damage or loss resulted from acts of mob violence, terrorist attacks, or other hostile acts directed against the U.S. government or its officers or employees. Sets forth the order and priority of payment in the event the claimant is deceased. States that such claim must be submitted in writing within two years after it accrues, or within one year after enactment of this Act, whichever is later. Requires each agency to issue regulations governing claims settlements. Prohibits further adjudication of specified claims settled under this Act, unless such claims have not been paid. Subrogates the United States to any rights or claims the claimant may have against the foreign country in which the damage or loss occurred, upon payment of such claim. States that no funds may be obligated or expended pursuant to this Act before fiscal year 1981, except to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Requires that any payments made pursuant to this Act before fiscal year 1981 be made from funds appropriated before the date of enactment of this Act."
