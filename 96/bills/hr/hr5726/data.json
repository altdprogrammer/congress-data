Authorizes the Tennessee Valley Authority to carry out responsibilities under such provisions of those public utilities whose rates are regulated by that entity. Stipulates that neither the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, nor any other agency shall be barred from challenging anticompetitive acts or practices related to activities conducted under this Act nor shall any person be deemed to have immunities or defenses to actions under the antitrust laws as a result of the provisions of this Act. Provides that amendments made to the utility program of such Act by this Act shall not apply to any activities carried out pursuant to an exemption or waiver of the prohibitions against installation or financing of residential energy conservation.

Authorizes the Bank to provide such assistance in the form of payments to financial institutions and public utilities providing financing pursuant to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. Sets forth criteria for providing such assistance and terms, conditions, and maximum amounts thereof. Establishes as part of the Bank an Advisory Committee to provide advice to the Board of Directors of the Bank on matters concerning energy conservation assistance. Directs the Bank to promote the program established by this Act and to coordinate its efforts with the Department of Energy.

Authorizes appropriations for use before the establishment of such Fund for which the Fund shall reimburse the Treasury. =Title III: Secondary Financing= - Requires that the Board direct the Bank to make commitments to purchase, and to purchase and to service, sell, and otherwise deal in loans and advances of credit made under this Act and the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to residential building owners for the purchase of energy conserving improvements. Authorizes the Bank to issue obligations to enable the Bank to carry out its functions. Exempts transactions authorized under this Act from State or local usury or loan insurance laws. Repeals specified provisions of the National Housing Act which authorize the Government National Mortgage Association to purchase energy conserving improvement loans. Amends the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to authorize such Corporation to purchase, make commitments to purchase, and to hold, deal with, sell, and otherwise dispose of mortgages or interest therein held by any public utility acting under a utility program pursuant to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act the original proceeds of which are applied for in order to finance energy conserving improvements. Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act to authorize such association to exercise powers similar to those granted above to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. =Title IV: Weatherization Program= - Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to limit the amount of any grant made under such Act to be used for administrative purposes. Amends such Act to increase the amount of payment which may be made to pay volunteers, trainees, and public employment workers not participating under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 but available to work on weatherization projects in the event there are insufficient participants under such program. Requires the coordination of activities related to rehabilitation, weatherization, and code enforcement conducted by local governments including activities undertaken pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act and related to energy assistance programs for low-income families, including programs under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary to establish standards and procedures for weatherization programs under such Act in a manner designed to accomplish uniform results among all the States in similar climate areas. Directs the President to designate the Secretary of Energy to assure that the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health, Education and Welfare, Defense, the Administrator of the General Services Administration and other heads of agencies responsible for developing energy conservation standards reach a consensus on establishing criteria for developing such standards. Directs the President to make annual reports to the Congress on the activities relating to coordination of Federal energy conservation programs.
