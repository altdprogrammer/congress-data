    "text": "Child Welfare Amendments of 1979 - Establishes under title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Aid for Child Welfare Services) of the Social Security Act a new part, part E (Federal Payments for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance). Requires a State, in order to be eligible under such part for Federal payments, to establish a foster care and adoption assistance program meeting certain requirements including: (1) a \"case review\" of every child in foster care at least once every six months; (2) procedural safeguards of the rights of parents, foster parents, and children; and (3) an opportunity for a fair hearing to any individual whose request for benefits under part E is not acted on with reasonable promptness. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of Federal payments to States under such program. Defines the term \"case review,\" as used in this Act, to mean a review by a court or an administrative review with respect to each child in foster care which: (1) verifies that there is a \"case plan\" for every child; (2) evaluates the progress toward eliminating the need for placement in foster care; and (3) sets a date by which it is expected a child can be returned home, adopted, or otherwise placed. Authorizes States with plans approved under part E to make: (1) foster care maintenance payments in the case of certain children removed from their homes pursuant to judicial determination that removal is necessary to protect the child or pursuant to a \"voluntary placement agreement\"; and (2) adoption assistance payments to parents eligible for such assistance under this Act. Sets forth provisions for parents who adopt children with special needs. Defines a child with special needs as one who is difficult or impossible to place because of, among other things, such child's ethnic background, age, or handicaps. Requires States under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide Medicaid coverage for an individual under the age of 18, on behalf of whom adoption assistance payments are being made, and who has a medical condition which was a contributing factor in the difficulty of placing such child for adoption. Stipulates that such coverage need not be full Medicaid coverage but shall at least cover the treatment of the condition which was a contributing factor in the difficulty of placing such child. Revises State plan requirements under part B (Child Welfare Services) of title IV of the Social Security Act. Sets forth a new formula for determining payments to States under part B. Permits payments to a State in an amount greater than that received in fiscal year 1979 if such State completes the required \"case reviews\" of children in foster care and if there is in operation a statewide information system providing certain information concerning children in foster care. Requires a State plan under part A (Aid to families with Dependent Children) of title IV to provide assurances that the State will provide foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments in accordance with the program established by this Act."
