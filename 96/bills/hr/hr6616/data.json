    "as": "Passed House amended",

    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #229 (372-24)) Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 to carry out the provisions of such Act. Amends such Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) conduct research, training, and demonstrations for the purpose of determining means of minimizing or ending ocean dumping and developing disposal methods as alternatives to such dumping; and (2) provide for the coordination of such research among appropriate Federal, State, local, or interstate public authorities, agencies, and institutions and provide financial and other assistance to such entities. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 through 1982 for research programs authorized under such Act. Redefines \"State\", for specified purposes of such Act, to include any of the several States or any territory or possession of the United States which has a popularly elected Governor. Renders the designation of a marine sanctuary, or any terms included therein, by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to such Act ineffective upon: (1) certification to the Secretary by the Governor of any State in which such designation is made that such designation or any of its terms are unacceptable to such State; or (2) adoption of a concurrent resolution by both Houses of Congress disapproving such designation or any of its terms. Sets forth terms to be included in such designations and authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to implement such terms and control the activities permitted under such designation. Directs the Secretary to conduct research to carry out the purposes of such Act. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to conduct enforcement activities to carry out the purposes of such Act. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Congress a marine sanctuary designation at the time of its publication. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for making such designations, and for research and enforcement. Adds \"industrial waste\" to the provision of such Act requiring the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to end the dumping of sewage sludge into ocean waters, but provides that after December 31, 1981, the Administrator may issue permits for the ocean dumping of industrial waste upon determination that such proposed dumping: (1) is necessary for research purposes; (2) will have minimal adverse impact upon human health and welfare and the marine environment; or (3) will provide potential benefits outweighing any such adverse impact. States that such permits shall be effective for no more than six months. Authorizes the Administrator to impose such conditions and restrictions on permits as are necessary to minimize possible adverse impacts of such dumping. Authorizes the Administrator to issue emergency permits for the dumping of industrial wastes into ocean waters, or other specified waters, after December 31, 1981. Requires, for such issuance, that the Administrator determine that there has been demonstrated to exist an emergency requiring the dumping of such waste which poses an unacceptable risk relating to human health and admits of no other feasible solution. Defines \"sewage sludge\", for specified purposes of such Act, as any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated by a municipal wastewater treatment plant the ocean dumping of which may unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, or amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities. Defines \"industrial waste\" as any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated by a manufacturer or processing plant which, if dumped in the ocean, may degrade or endanger human health or welfare or the marine environment. Makes the provisions of such Act concerning foreign-state ocean-dumping permits applicable to transportation of material by an agency or instrumentality of the United States, with a proviso that the Administrator must concur in the filing of an application for such permit. Requires that dumping of dredged materials in the Long Island Sound comply with specified provisions of such Act, in addition to other applicable Federal and State requirements."
