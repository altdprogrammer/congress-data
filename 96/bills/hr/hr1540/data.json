    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-01-25", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to prohibit any railroad covered by such Act from discharging, harassing, or discriminating against a railroad employee for (1) notifying the Secretary of Transportation of any alleged violation or danger; (2) filing, instituting, or causing to be filed or instituted any proceeding against the railroad company resulting from any alleged violations of this Act; (3) testifying or planning to testify in any proceeding resulting from the administration or enforcement of the provisions of this Act; (4) refusing to operate defective equipment which he reasonably believes to be in violation of this Act; and (5) refusing to work in an area or surroundings which he reasonably believes presents an imminent danger to his safety and health. Gives an employee the right to request reassignment, or to stop work without loss in pay if denied reassignment, should conditions in violation of this Act exist at his then current assignment. Provides for the assessment of civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the collective-bargaining representative of the craft or class of employees adversely affected to take appropriate action to enforce any violations under such Act should the Secretary fail to take such action. Amends the Hours of Service Act to require rail carriers to provide transportation to employees (who have been given an interim period of release at a designated terminal) to an available lodging facility within 30 minutes from the time of such release."
