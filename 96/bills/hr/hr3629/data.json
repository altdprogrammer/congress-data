Includes among the eligibility criteria for receipt of such grants that: (1) at least 60 percent of the hospital's outpatient and emergency room visits during the three-year period preceding such hospital's application have been by such individuals; (2) the hospital will be unable, without such a grant, to continue operations for more than six months from the date of application; and (3) the hospital enters into an agreement with the Secretary to carry out specified activities, including the elimination of excessive inpatient services."
