Limits the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress, Delegates to the House of Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leader of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the Speaker of the House to the rate payable for such positions for October 1, 1979. Requires the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress during the 97th Congress to be adjusted, effective January 3, 1981, by the overall average percentage adjustments which took effect during the calendar years 1979 and 1980. Requires that any such adjustment of pay shall take effect at the beginning of the Congress following the Congress during which which such rates of pay were recommended and approved. Prohibits any congressional employee from being paid at a rate in excess of the pay rate payable for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives."
