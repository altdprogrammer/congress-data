Defines \"money supply\" as the sum of coin and currency held by the public outside the Treasury, Federal Reserve banks, and vaults of commercial banks plus funds held in any depository institution in demand deposits and savings deposits subject to automatic transfers or orders of withdrawal excluding domestic interbank deposits and deposits of the United States Government."
