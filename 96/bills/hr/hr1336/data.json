    "text": "National School-Age Mother and Child Health Act of 1979 - Amends title III of the Public Health Service Act (General Powers and Duties of Public Health Service) to authorize and direct the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to designated State agencies to meet part of the cost of planning and coordinating services for school-age girls and their children. Sets forth requirements which State plans must meet before receiving such grants, including: (1) comprehensive health care to school-age girls associated with the continuation of pregnancy and to their children, health education, community outreach, family planning services, continuing education of mothers, counseling for the mother and father of the child, infant and child day care, adoption and foster care services, and a coordinated program of social services. Prohibits the collection by, or submission to, the Federal or State Government or any individual or organization (except the program delivering the services and third-party payers) of identifying information of persons receiving services under this program. Establishes a unit within the Maternal and Child Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to administer and coordinate such program."
