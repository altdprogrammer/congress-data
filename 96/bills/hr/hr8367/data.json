Directs the Committee to advise the United States Postal Service regarding the approval of bids for the printing, distribution, and sale of postage stamps containing the logos of domestic corporations. Authorizes the Postal Service to enter into a contract to print, distribute, and sell an issue of 50,000 of such stamps for any domestic corporation for a minimum price of $10,000. Requires the Committee to advertise the availability of such service, to review the bids received for each issue, and to recommend the bids which would be the most economically advantageous to the Postal service. Directs the Commiottee and the Postal Service to reject all bids for an issue if such action is in the public interest. Declares that the Postal Service shall receive all of the revenues from the sale of such stamps. Requires the Postal Service to report to Congress on the merits of the provisions of this Act as a revenue-raising mechanism."
