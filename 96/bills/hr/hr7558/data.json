    "text": "District of Columbia Annual Federal Payment Act - Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to set forth as the rationale for the annual Federal payment to the District of Columbia the net effect of the costs and benefits to the District. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, for fiscal year 1982 and for each fiscal year thereafter, to pay to the District of Columbia, from funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, as the annual Federal payment to the District an amount equal to the averaged Federal payment percentage, as determined according to this Act, multiplied by the total amount of tax revenues received by the District during the fiscal year ending 12 months before the beginning of such fiscal year. Sets forth the formula for determining the averaged Federal payment percentage. Requires the Mayor, not later than December 1, of each year, to submit to the President of the United States, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the District of Columbia Council, a statement which contains an estimate of the tax revenues received by the District during the preceding fiscal year and an estimate of the amount of the annual Federal payment to the District for the following fiscal year. Requires the Mayor, not later than February 1, of each year to submit a final statement of the tax revenues received by the District during the preceding fiscal year. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States, not later than April 1 of each year, to certify the total amount of the tax revenues of the District for the preceding fiscal year. Directs that the amount required to be paid to the District by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be paid without further appropriation at the beginning of each fiscal year for which the amount is paid. Requires specified Congressional committees, not later than five years after the date of enactment of this Act, to study the operation of such Act and report its findings to Congress."
