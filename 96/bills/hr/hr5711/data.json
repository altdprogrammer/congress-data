    "text": "All-Idaho Multiple-Use Land Management Act of 1979 - Designates portions of central Idaho wildlands, (formerly known as the Salmon River Breaks-Idaho Primitive Areas), Selway-Bitterroot-Lakes, and Lionhead areas as wilderness and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Withdraws the minerals in Federal lands within such wilderness areas after 2000 from all forms of appropriation under the mining laws, from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral leasing, and from leasing or other disposition under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Permits the use of aircraft and motorboats, and the grazing of livestock, where established prior to the effective date of this Act, to continue at existing levels, and to be increased subject to regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture. Allows commercial services to be performed within such wilderness areas, to the extent necessary for recreational or other wilderness purposes of the areas. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study seven specified areas in national forests in Idaho to determine their suitability and for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Specifies that all national forest lands within the State of Idaho which are not wilderness study areas as a result of this Act or statutory wilderness areas shall be managed by the Secretary of Agriculture for uses other than wilderness. Declares that such lands shall not be the subject of further studies by a department or agency of the Federal Government for possible inclusion into the National Wilderness Preservation System, the National Parks System, or the National Monument System, nor shall commodity production be delayed or prohibited for any reason other than normal land management planning."
