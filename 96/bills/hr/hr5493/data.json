    "text": "Conservation and Renewable Energy Resource Act - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to add definitions of the terms \"commercial customer\" and \"energy conservation measure.\" Requires that utilities inspect residential buildings provided with energy conservation measures to ensure properly completed installation. Deletes the provision authorizing the utility to charge the administrative costs of carrying out a utility program to the particular residential customer for whom energy conservation measures have been provided. Directs regulated utilities to establish programs providing for the installation or maintenance by the utility or by approved independent contractors of energy conservation measures for commercial or residential customers. Directs such utilities to make loans to such customers for the purchase of energy conservation measures or for the installation of such measures by independent contractors. Requires that utilities conduct energy audits of buildings seeking to participate in such programs as as a condition of such participation. Sets forth qualifications for independent contractors seeking eligibility to participate in such programs. Sets forth procedures for the financing of such programs. Stipulates that these provisions shall preempt any State or local law prohibiting utilities from establishing such programs. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to establish a residential and commercial energy conservation grant program to reimburse eligible building owners for part of the costs of supplying or installing energy conservation measures. Directs the Secretary to arrange for the broad distribution of information regarding such grant program. Sets forth application procedures, requirements for eligibility for, and maximum amounts of such grants. Directs the Secretary of Energy to submit an annual report to the Congress on the operation of such grant program. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 to carry out such program."
