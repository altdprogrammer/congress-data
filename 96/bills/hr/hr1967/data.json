    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) Modifies the boundary of the White River National Forest in the State of Colorado to include additional areas of approximately 32,307 and 3,841 acres. Adds all lands owned by the United States within such modified boundary to such National Forest. Specifies that tracts of land identified in specified sales applications with the Bureau of Land Management shall not become a part of such National Forest unless they are denied in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. States that this Act shall not affect existing withdrawals, rights-of-way, licenses, leases, easements, or prospecting permits issued pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Cancels all other existing permits or grazing authorizations covering existing transferred lands, effective December 31 of the year following enactment. Allows holders of such permits to apply for new permits to the agency acquiring the administration of such land. Exempts such permittees from eligibility for compensation under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Specifies that such modified boundary shall be considered to have been the boundary on January 1, 1965, for purposes of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965."
