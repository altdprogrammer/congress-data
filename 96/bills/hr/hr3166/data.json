Vests such functions in the Secretary in order to permit him to coordinate, integrate, and administer programs conducive to: (1) increasing the production and improving the marketing and the quality of food, fiber, and forest products; and (2) improving the economic condition of families engaged in farming. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate any such function to any appropriate employee of the Department of Agriculture, but prohibits the establishment of any organizational unit within the Department for the sole purpose of carrying out one or more of such functions. Creates an Under Secretary of Agriculture for Domestic Agricultural Affairs to perform functions relating to the productive and marketing of food, fiber, and forest products in the United States and in its territories and possessions. Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to create an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Science and Education."
