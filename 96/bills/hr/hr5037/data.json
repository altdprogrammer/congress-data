Directs the President to appoint a Vice Chairman for a term of four years. Enumerates the duties of the Vice Chairman of the Board. Stipulates that the person serving as Chairman on the date of enactment of this Act may serve the original four year appointment without regard to the provisions of this Act. Permits two members of the Board to represent the same district if one is serving or has served as Chairman. Repeals the requirement that the Board's annual report to Congress be printed as a congressional document. Terminates the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to require the delivery of all gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates held in the private sector to the Treasurer of the United States."
