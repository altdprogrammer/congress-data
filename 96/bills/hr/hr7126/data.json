Rept. 96-968) Toxic Substances Control Act Amendment of 1980 - Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of such Act for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study, by contract with the Office of Technology Assessment, to determine the adequacy of compensation and other assistance available to persons to mitigate health problems or economic losses caused by hazardous chemical substances, and to issue and submit to appropriate congressional committees a detailed report on the results of such study. Prohibits entering into any contract for such study, except to the extent, or in such amounts, as may be provided in appropriation Acts. Declares that the Office of Technology Assessment is not required to conduct such study unless sufficient funds are made available for such purpose. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000 for such study. Directs the Administrator to provide for the monitoring of emissions at facilities used to incinerate polychlorinated biphenyls (\"PCBs\") and to hold briefings for the general public to report the results of such monitoring."
