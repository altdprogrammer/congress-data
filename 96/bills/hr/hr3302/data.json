    "text": "Nuclear Power Facility Siting and Licensing Act of 1979 - Title I: Siting and Licensing - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, upon initially granting a construction permit for nuclear power facilities, to provide on-site inspection of such construction to ensure conformity with the permit and Commission rules and regulations. Authorizes the Commission to issue an operating license upon finding such conformity and in the absence of good cause showing why the granting of such license would not be in accordance with such Act. Authorizes the Commission to require facility design or construction modifications after a construction permit is issued, in order to provide additional health and safety protection. Amends such Act to include among those actions for which hearings may be granted any proceeding for the granting, suspending, revoking, renewing, or amending of a facility design or design of a subsystem thereof. Sets forth notice requirements for such hearings. Authorizes the Commission to permit interim operation of nuclear power facilities or to issue an interim amendment to a facility's operating license upon a finding that the public health and safety, the common defense and security, and the environment will be adequately protected during the period of interim operation and that such interim operation is in the public interest. Authorizes the Commission to issue a site permit for approval of a site for one or more nuclear power facilities upon the application of any person, notwithstanding the fact that no construction permit for such facility or facilities has been filed. Sets forth criteria for such application approval and specifies the information to be included in such application. Authorizes the renewal of such site permits between 18 and 48 months prior to the expiration of the ten year permit validity period. Authorizes the Commission to approve standardized facility design and facility subsystems by means of rulemaking or a manufacturing license proceeding. Authorizes the Commission to consider proposed modifications to such facility designs and to require such modification upon proof, established by the Commission at a hearing, that such modification will produce significant additional protection for public health and safety and that the value of such protection exceeds the additional costs associated therewith. Authorizes the renewal of such rules or manufacturing licenses between 12 and 18 months prior to the expiration of the five-year validity period. Title II: Federal and State Coordination - Directs the Commission to coordinate its licensing functions with Federal and State agencies having responsibility for nuclear power facilities, and to eliminate unnecessary duplication and delay in the licensing process. Sets forth procedures and time limitations for specified steps in the licensing process. Defers to the States the determination of need for such facilities. Directs the Governor of any State seeking to qualify for Federal funding of a program to cooperate with the Commission in its licensing process to submit a proposed program for review. Authorizes the Commission to establish State program review guidelines based on criteria set forth in this Act. Authorizes the Commission to make grants for the development and administration of such programs. Directs the President to establish a Federal/State Licensing Study Commission to further facilitate such coordination and cooperation in the licensing process. Provides that upon submission of its report and recommendations to the President and the Congress, such Commission shall expire, but not later than 18 months after it is established. Title III: Regulation of Airborne Effluents - Relieves the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency of his authority under the Clean Air Act to classify airborne emissions of radioactive materials from nuclear power facilities upon promulgation by the Commission of rules and regulations governing such materials. Title IV: Conforming Amendments - Makes conforming amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Title V: Effective Date - Sets the effective date of this Act as of the date of its enactment. Provides for a waiver of up to two years of any of its provisions if consistent with the purpose of this Act."
