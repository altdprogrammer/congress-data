    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-01-15", 
    "text": "Gun Control Registration and Licensing Act of 1979 - Title I: Registration of Firearms - Makes it unlawful to possess a firearm not registered as provided by this title. Exempts from this prohibition firearms, previously unregistered, which are: (1) held by a licensed dealer for sale; (2) continuously possessed by an individual up to 180 days after the effective date of this Act; or (3) possessed by Federal, State, or local governments. Requires a purchaser of a firearm from a person other than a licensed dealer to make application with the Secretary of the Treasury for the registration of the firearm. Directs a seller of a registered firearm to return the certificate of registration to the Secretary. Requires a licensed dealer to accept from a purchaser a completed application for registration of the firearm and to file such application with the Secretary. Specifies data to be included in such applications, and sets the original application fee at one dollar. Prohibits a licensed dealer from: (1) receiving firearms by pledge or pawn without a registration certificate; and (2) selling ammunition without seeing a purchaser's certificate. Requires the possessor of a firearm to notify the Secretary within ten days of loss, theft, or destruction of the firearm. Imposes criminal penalties for violation of the registration requirements and for the knowing falsification of information required by this Title. Authorizes the Secretary to pay reasonable value for the voluntary relinquishment of firearms. Title II: Gun Permits - Specifies requirements for an adequate permit system for the possession of firearms, and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to determine which States have adopted such systems. Makes it unlawful to transfer any firearm or ammunition to any person who does not have a valid State or Federal permit. Specifies qualifications which must be met before a licensed dealer shall issue a Federal gun license. Sets the cost of such license at one dollar, and requires dealers to maintain records of all licenses issued. Title III: Handgun Controls - Makes it unlawful for any person to import, manufacture, sell, buy, transfer, receive, transport, own, or possess any handgun or handgun ammunition. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to exempt from this prohibition handguns: (1) required for the operation of licensed pistol clubs; (2) utilized by Federal, State, and local agencies or by licensed security guard services; or (3) manufactured before 1890 and which are unserviceable and intended for use as collector's items. Specifies procedures for the licensing of pistol clubs, including conditions for approval of applications by the Secretary of the Treasury and administrative and judicial review of a license denial or revocation. Sets forth requirements for the operation of licensed pistol clubs, including recordkeeping of the receipt, sale, or other disposition of handguns. Imposes criminal penalties on persons violating the provisions of this Act, including those persons making misrepresentations in required records or license applications. Subjects to seizure and forfeiture any handgun used, or intended to be used, in violation of this Act or any other Federal criminal law. Establishes procedures for the reimbursement of persons voluntarily delivering handguns to a law enforcement agency."
