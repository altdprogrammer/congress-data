    "text": "Uniformed Services Health Professionals Special Pay Act of 1979 - Provides special and additional pay for physicians in the Armed Forces or the Public Health Service who are on active duty for a period of not less than one year. Sets forth a schedule for such special pay providing that: (1) physicians below pay grade 0-7 are to receive between $1,200 and $10,000 per year based on years of creditable service; and (2) physicians above pay grade 0-6 are to receive $1,000 per year. Entitles a physician eligible for special pay to an additional $10,000 annual payment for any 12 month period during which he or she is not undergoing medical internship or initial residency training. Requires such a physician to agree in writing to remain on active duty for a period of not less than one year in order to receive such $10,000 additional payment. Authorizes additional special pay (from $2,000 to $5,000 based on years of creditable service) for those physicians eligible for special pay who are board certified (under regulations prescribed by this Act). Sets forth a special pay schedule for dentists in the Armed Forces or the Public Health Service who are on active duty for not less than one year providing that: (1) dentists below pay grade 0-7 are to receive between $1,200 and $7,000 per year based on years of creditable service; and (2) dentists above pay grade 0-6 are to receive $1,000 per year. Entitles a dentist eligible for special pay to an additional annual payment ($6,000 to $8,000 depending on years of creditable service) for any 12 month period during which he or she is not undergoing dental internship or residency training. Requires such a dentist to agree in writing to remain on active duty for a period of not less than one year in order to receive such payment. Authorizes additional special pay (from $2,000 to $5,000 based on years of creditable service) for those dentists eligible for special pay who are board certified. Sets forth a special pay schedule for optometrists in the Armed Forces or the Public Health Service who are on active duty for not less than one year providing for: (1) payments of $1,000 to $3,000 per year depending on years of creditable service; and (2) additional annual payments of $1,000 for optometrists with at least three years of creditable service. Requires a written agreement for such additional payments. Defines \"creditable service\" for purposes of this Act to include all time spent in internship or residency while not on active duty, and all time spent on active duty (as a physician, dentist, or optometrist). Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish standards for determining whether an officer is: (1) undergoing medical, dental, or optometry internship or residency training; and (2) board certified for a medical or dental specialty. Stipulates that any special pay received under this Act may not be included in computing the amount of any increase in pay authorized by any other uniformed services pay provisions, or in computing retired, severance, or readjustment pay. Provides for the refund of a specified percentage of the amount received by an officer who voluntarily terminates active service before the expiration of the one-year written agreement. Directs the Secretary to conduct a review every two years of such special pay authorizations. Requires the first such review to be submitted to the Congress no later than September 30, 1982. Repeals existing provisions of Federal law: (1) prohibiting special pay for veterinarians after September 1980; (2) setting forth guidelines for physicians' and dentists' continuation pay; and (3) regarding special pay for specified physicians below pay grade 0-7 who execute active duty agreements. Directs the Secretary to conduct an evaluation of alternatives for addressing the existing maldistribution of medical and dental specialties within the Armed Forces. Requires a final report to be submitted to the Congress no later than two years after enactment of this Act. Stipulates that health professionals eligible for basic and special pay under existing provisions shall not be paid less than such amounts as a result of amendments made by this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1981. Provides that special pay provisions under this Act shall take effect for periods beginning after September 30, 1979, or after the date of enactment of this Act, whichever is later."
