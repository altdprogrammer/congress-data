Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue regulations to carry out such inspection and manning requirements. Increases the civil penalty for violations of such manning requirements. Defines \"offshore supply vessel\" for the purposes of this Act. Directs that such vessels must comply with specified inspection and manning requirements. Directs the Secretary to license and classify specified crew members of all vessels subject to the vessel inspection or manning laws of the United States. Sets forth requirements for qualification as an able seaman for certain categories of vessels, including those engaged in the exploration, exploitation, or production of offshore mineral or energy resources. Makes freight-carrying vessels below a specified size subject to the same inspection requirements as those applicable to smaller passenger-carrying vessels. Makes it unlawful to employ any person, or for any person to serve aboard a vessel to which this Act applies, other than a licensed officer, if that person does not have a certificate of service attesting to proficiency issued by the Secretary. Makes conforming and technical amendments to specified Acts. Authorizes the Secretary to issue a temporary license, for no longer than three years, to specified crew members who served on board an offshore supply vessel on or before January 1, 1979. Prohibits a person so licensed from serving under such license on a vessel other than an offshore supply vessel."
