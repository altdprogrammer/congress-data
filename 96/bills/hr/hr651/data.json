    "text": "Authorizes the Governors of the various States to designate areas as energy impact road areas if: (1) energy resource development is occurring in the area; (2) a substantial amount of such energy will not be consumed in such area; and (3) without assistance there will be an immediate or long range deterioration in the physical condition and safety of Federal-aid primary and secondary roads within the area. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to approve repair projects for such roads. Authorizes appropriations of $100,000,000 out of the Highway Trust Fund for each of the fiscal years 1980 and 1981 to carry out such energy impact road rehabilitation program. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall be 70 percent of its cost."
