Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to take full possession of all Czechoslovak gold located in the United States, if a settlement agreement is not submitted to Congress, or such agreement has not been approved by Congress, within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary of State to negotiate with Great Britain and France to obtain permission to sell Czechoslovak gold located in Great Britain. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to sell all such gold obtained and invest the proceeds in safe U.S. and foreign securities for payment of the awards of U.S. nationals. Requires all interest and other income from such investments to be deposited into the Czechoslovakian Claims Fund for distribution to those U.S. nationals holding certified awards against Czechoslovakia. Provides for the payment to Czechoslovakia of all the proceeds from such gold sale and any balance remaining in such Fund after all such awards have been paid and Treasury Department expenses are recovered. Denies jurisdiction to any court over any claim against the United States for actions taken under this Act. Supercedes provisions prohibiting the release of Czechoslovak gold until an agreement with Czechoslovakia is approved by Congress."
