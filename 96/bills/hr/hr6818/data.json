    "text": "Title I: Northeast Corridor - Northeast Corridor Redirection Act of 1980 - Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (the Act) to extend the time period within which: (1) regularly scheduled and dependable intercity rail passenger service is to be established between Boston and New York, and New York and Washington, D.C.; and (2) the Secretary of Transportation must submit to Congress an updated, comprehensive report on the financial and operating results of such service. Adds as a new goal of the Act, the elimination of congestion in rail traffic at the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the Boston-Washington, D.C. passenger service required by the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire necessary real estate interests to effectuate the goals of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with cost-sharing State, local, or regional transportation authorities, providing for the Secretary to carry out such improvements and requiring reimbursement by the cost-sharing parties. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation excess real or personal property from the Northeast Corridor improvement project. Requires that such property be subject to the mortgage entered into pursuant to the Act. Declares that it shall be a goal of the Corporation to manage its operating costs, pricing policies, and other factors so that annual revenues derived from the operation of intercity rail passenger service over the Northeast Corridor route between Washington, D. C., and Boston, Massachusetts, shall equal or exceed the annual operating costs of providing such service. Establishes a goal of self-sufficiency for such intercity passenger service within five years of the completion of such project. Requires the Corporation to submit to the President for transmission to the Congress a report on the success of the Corporation in attaining such goal. Title II: National Rail Passenger Corridor Projects - National Rail Passenger Corridors Act of 1980 - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to declare that it is the purpose of this title to provide for the development of high-speed intercity rail passenger service in corridors throughout the United States. Directs the Secretary, under such Act, to establish improvement projects in 13 specified rail passenger corridors. Sets forth a deadline for meeting specified service goals for such projects. Directs the Corporation to develop design and engineering plans for each corridor improvement project. Directs the Corporation to consult with the States and rail carriers to be affected by the provision of such rail passenger service. Authorizes the Corporation to undertake specified improvements in tracks and facilities. Directs the Corporation to acquire specified new equipment. Requires the Corporation to submit: (1) by January 1, 1981, a report to Congress concerning preliminary cost estimates of such improvement; and (2) by July 1, 1981, a report to Congress setting forth final estimates in regard to such costs in each corridor. Directs the Corporation to enter into contracts and agreements with other rail carriers for the improvement of such tracks and facilities. Authorizes the Corporation to apply to the Secretary for an order directing such rail carrier to make the requested improvements. Permits the Secretary to order such improvements under certain conditions and including specified terms. Directs the Secretary to use certain criteria in establishing compensation for such required improvements. Directs the Corporation, under certain conditions, to undertake improvements in service between corridors in order to maximize ridership. Directs the Corporation to report to the Secretary any deterioration suffered by a track improved under this title. Directs the Secretary to investigate such track and, if necessary, order the rail carrier which owns such track to make the appropriate repairs by a specified date. Sets forth a civil penalty and an affirmative defense for a failure to comply with such order of the Secretary. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct annual audits, using the records of the Corporation, and to report on each audit to Congress. Directs the Corporation to identify restrictions imposed by a State or local government on the speed of Amtrak trains and to consult with such governments for purposes of evaluating alternatives to such restrictions. Directs the Corporation to include in its annual report to Congress certain information with respect to each corridor improvement project. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of this title. Directs the Secretary, under specified conditions, to order a rail carrier to permit Amtrak trains over its lines for compensation agreed upon by the Corporation and such carrier or ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission."
