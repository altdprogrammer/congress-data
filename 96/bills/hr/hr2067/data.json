    "text": "International Sugar Stabilization Act of 1979 - Title I: International Sugar Agreement, 1977 - Authorizes the President to implement the International Sugar Agreement by (1) regulating the entry of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization, and (2) requiring records and reports concerning the entry of sugar. Establishes criminal penalties for violating such regulations. Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual report on the Agreement. Title II: Import Restrictions on Sugar - Establishes 15 cents per pound, raw value, as the price objective for domestic sugar during the 1978 sugar supply year. Sets forth the formula for determining the price objective for succeeding years. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor the average daily price of sugar imports. Directs the Secretary to recommend that the President impose special import duties and quotas on sugar and sugar-containing products to assure that the average daily price of sugar imports will meet the proclaimed price objective for sugar. Specifies the manner in which country-by-country quotas should be allocated. Requires the Secretary to review quarterly the imposed duties and quotas and recommend any adjustments to the President. Authorizes the President to impose special import duties or quotas after receiving any recommendation of the Secretary. Requires the President to request an investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission to determine whether the entry of sugar-containing products is adversely affecting the achievement of the price objective before imposing any special import duty on such products. Prohibits the importation of more than 100 pounds of sugar annually into the Virgin Islands. Prohibits the exportation of certain sugar. Establishes penalties for violations of such regulations. Exempts certain sugar or sugar-containing products from this title. Specifies that certain sugar entered for subsequent export shall not be charged against any proclaimed quota. Authorizes the President to suspend the operation of this title in a national emergency. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to permit the President to proclaim special import duties and quotas on sugars, syrups, and molasses in order to carry out this Act. Title III: Farm Labor Provisions - Requires every producer of sugar beets and sugarcane to pay each employee a specified minimum wage. Authorizes actions against producers failing to pay the specified wages in any Federal or State court. Authorizes the Secretary to supervise the payment of unpaid wages owing to any employee. Requires actions to be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued. Prohibits any producer from discriminating against any employee who has participated in an investigation or proceeding under this title. Prohibits any producer from charging more than the reasonable costs of furnishing customary goods or services to employees. Requires producers to furnish workmen's compensation insurance to employees. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Vests jurisdiction for enforcing this Act in U.S. district courts. Requires all persons engaged in manufacturing, marketing, transporting, or industrial use of sugar and other sweeteners to furnish the Secretary with necessary information. Prohibits officials engaged in the administration of this Act from investing or speculating in sugar. Establishes penalties for violating these regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct surveys and investigations to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to waive part of the interest and/or principal to encourage repayment of Commodity Credit Corporation loans with respect to the 1977 and 1978 crops of sugar beets and sugarcane. Terminates this Act, except for Title I, September 30, 1983."
