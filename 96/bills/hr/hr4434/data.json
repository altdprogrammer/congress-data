    "text": "Energy Development and Management Authority Act - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to expedite the production of liquid and gaseous fuels from coal. Establishes a Government corporation to be known as the Energy Development and Management Authority to establish the Office for the Production of Energy from Coal, which shall conduct research on coal conversion technologies, develop facilities for the production of liquid and gaseous fuels from coal, and sell such fuels. States that such Authority shall also develop a plan for increasing the Nation's energy supplies by the production of such fuels and examine solar, geothermal, steam, wind, oil shale, and other energy sources to determine the need to establish programs for expedited development of such energy sources. Provides that such Authority shall be administered by a Board of Supervisors and sets forth the composition, duties, and powers of such Board, including the power to conduct research, explore for and purchase coal, construct and operate facilities for converting coal to liquid and gaseous fuels, provide financial and technical assistance to private industry to increase the Nation's energy supplies, and request the right to explore and develop coal located on Federal lands except national parks, wilderness areas, national seashores, or wildlife refuge areas. Exempts the Authority from State and local statutes or controls which are deemed by the Board to interfere with its activities as required by this Act. Authorizes the Authority to exercise the right of eminent domain in the name of the United States. Authorizes the Authority to incur debt in the form of bonds, debentures, securities, and other obligations in an amount not exceeding $50,000,000,000. Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000,000,000 to carry out this Act. Amends the Government Corporation Control Act to include within its purview the Energy Development and Management Authority."
