    "text": "Intelligence Reform Act of 1980 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to define \"special activity\" to mean activity conducted abroad to further official United States programs and policies which is planned and executed so that the role of the Government is not apparent or acknowledged publicly, but excluding diplomatic activity and the collection of intelligence or related support functions. Prohibits the expenditure of funds by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for a special activity unless: (1) the President finds that the activity is important to the national security and reports such activity to the congressional select intelligence committees (current law requires such reporting to the \"appropriate\" congressional committees); or (2) the National Security Council (NSC) determines that the activity does not involve substantial resources or risks and falls within a category of special activities which (A) have been found by the President to be important to the national security, and (B) have been reported to the congressional select intelligence committees. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to exempt information in files maintained by an intelligence agency or component of the Government from the provisions of any law requiring publication or disclosure, if such files have been specifically designated by the Director of Central Intelligence to be concerned with: (1) scientific or technical systems for the collection of foreign intelligence; (2) special activities and foreign intelligence operations; (3) investigations to determine the suitability of potential foreign intelligence sources; and (4) intelligence liaison arrangements with foreign governments. Requires requests by U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens for information concerning themselves to be processed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to add a new title V, \"Protection of Certain National Security Information.\" Establishes a maximum criminal penalty of ten years' imprisonment and/or a $50,000 fine for anyone who, having had authorized access to classified information, intentionally discloses to any individual not authorized to receive classified information any information that identifies an individual as an employee of an intelligence agency or as an agent, informant, or source of assistance to an intelligence agency, where the actor knows or has reason to know that the information so identifies such individual and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such individual's intelligence relationship to the U.S. Establishes a maximum criminal penalty of one year imprisonment and/or a $5,000 fine for anyone who with intent to impair the foreign intelligence activities of the U.S. discloses such information with such knowledge. Makes it a defense to such crimes that before the commission of the offense the United States had publicly acknowledged or revealed the intelligence relationship of the individual to the United States Stipulates that it shall not be an offense to transmit such information directly to the congressional intelligence committees. Defines \"intelligence agency\" for the purposes of such offenses to mean the CIA, any intelligence component of the Department of Defense, and any foreign intelligence component of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
