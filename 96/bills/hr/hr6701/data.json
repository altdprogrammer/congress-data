    "text": "Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove the 100 visit limitation presently applicable to home health care services under such title. Eliminates prior hospitalization as a condition of eligibility for home health care services under part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) of such title. Eliminates the requirement that a physician review the home health care plan and that the patient be under the care of a physician. Requires that such functions be done by the appropriate health professional under regulation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Includes as home health services periodic chore services, hospital outreach services, and nutritional counseling. Requires each home health agency to have in effect a utilization review plan as adapted to meet the noninstitutional nature of home health services. Includes outpatient rehabilitation services and health and supportive services furnished in elderly day care centers among the services provided under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) of title XVIII. Amends part B (Professional Standards Review) of title XI of the Act to: (1) direct a Professional Standards Review Organization to perform the same duties and functions for skilled nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and other long-term care providers as it performs for hospitals; and (2) include nurses, social workers, guidance counselors, and other appropriate health care professionals."
