Requires the Secretary to comply with specified provisions of this Act, before effectuating such transfer. Extinguishes the aboriginal title and any Indian claims to such lands.

Vests exclusive jurisdiction over any action to contest the constitutionality of this Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, and requires such action to be filed within 180 days of enactment. Extends the time limit within which the tribe may file an action claiming trespass damages for transfers of land to October 1, 1981, Prohibits such action unless the United States fails to perform its obligations under this Act or is precluded from performance of such obligations by a successful lawsuit."
