Suspends the guidelines for respiratory therapy services under Medicare pending submission of such study, and requires that Medicare costs for reimbursement of respiratory therapy services furnished under arrangements be evaluated so that such costs do not exceed what a prudent and cost- conscious buyer would pay for the given service in accordance with current Federal regulations."
