    "text": "Amends the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 to implement a new civil defense program for the 1980's designed to: (1) enhance the survivability of the American people and their leaders; (2) enhance strategic nuclear deterrence and stability; (3) continue and strengthen the Nation's policy of relying on superior nuclear forces and conventional tactical forces; (4) include planning and population relocation during times of international and domestic crisis; and (5) utilize the structure and capabilities of the National Guard to the maximum extent practicable. Directs the President to carry out such program and specifies elements to be included in such program. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act for each of the fiscal years 1980 through 1986. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to study the feasibility of using the National Guard as the principal organizing and training unit for local civil defense activities and to study the feasibility of using organizations composed of veterans, and other appropriate groups and individuals, to help in developing, staffing, and carrying out civil defense plans during periods of emergency. Requires the Director to submit the results of such studies to Congress within one year."
