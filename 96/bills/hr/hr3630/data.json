  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-04-10", 
    "text": "Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979 - Amends the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 to increase from 30 to 60 days the period in which an information or indictment must be filed from the date on which the individual was arrested or summoned with respect to a Federal offense. Modifies the current provisions requiring: (1) the arraignment of a defendant within ten days of the filing of the information or indictment; and (2) commencement of trial within 60 days of arraignment, to require commencement of trial not less than 30 nor more than 120 days from the filing of the information or indictment (or less than 30 days with the consent of the defendant). Applies the current time limits with respect to the retrial of a defendant following an appeal or collateral attack, to a trial upon an indictment or information dismissed by a trial court and reinstated following appeal. Extends the periods of delay which are excluded in computing the time limits for the filing of an information or indictment, and the commencement of trial, to include delay resulting from: (1) proceedings to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant; (2) election, examination, and determination of the defendant's eligibility for treatment under the Narcotic Addiction Rehabilitation Act; and (3) preparation and service of, and hearings on, pretrial motions and responses. Carries forward the current interim provision otherwise due to expire on July 1, 1979, which requires commencement of trial within 90 days from the beginning of continuous pretrial detention of a person who is awaiting trial or from the designation of a person as being of high risk who is released to await trial. Applies the delay provisions to this expedited trial limit. Authorizes the chief judge of a district court to suspend for up to 30 days the time limits provided by this Act when the need for such suspension is of great urgency, but requires such judge to apply to the judicial council of the circuit for a suspension (as currently provided) within ten days of the initial suspension."
