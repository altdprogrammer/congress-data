    "text": "Emergency Evacuation Act of 1980 - Directs the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop nuclear attack preparedness plans for the evacuation of civilian population centers which would be likely targets of a nuclear attack. Requires the Director to evaluate the extent to which such a plan can be used to prepare for response to serious civilian nuclear powerplant accidents and other accidents and natural disasters which may occur within the geographical area covered by the evacuation plan. Authorizes the Director to develop plans for the emergency evacuation of civilians in the event of serious industrial accidents or natural disasters. Requires the Director to review State and local plans, initiate emergency preparedness training of State and local officials, and develop a series of interagency assignments for emergency planning and response. Requires the Director to study the probability of serious accidents occurring at commercial and industrial facilities or involving energy and hazardous materials transportation systems or natural disasters where the implementation of emergency plans can significantly reduce the possibility of multiple loss of life. Requires the Director to submit an annual report to Congress containing: (1) the ranking of commercial or industrial facilities and of categories of transportation systems according to the probability of serious accidents; (2) a list of the number of deaths by category of industry, transportation system, and natural disaster; and (3) a plan for the allocation of resources by the Federal Emergency Management Agency."
