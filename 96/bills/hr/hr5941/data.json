Declares that during the 12-month period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, no consolidated or merged carrier may engage in any international transmission of telegraph traffic by wire or radio or otherwise engage in any international telegraph operations which are not authorized under the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Prohibits any international telegraph carrier from engaging in any domestic distribution of telegraph traffic by wire or radio or otherwise engage in any domestic telegraph operations to the extent that: (1) the nature of such distribution or operations differs from the nature of such distribution or operations as in effect at the beginning of November 1, 1979; or (2) the scope of such distribution or operations exceeds the scope of such distribution or operations as in effect at the beginning of November 1, 1979. Directs each consolidated or merged carrier to: (1) distribute among international telegraph carriers any telegraph traffic by wire or radio destined for any point outside the United States; and (2) divide charges for such traffic in accordance with any formula or practice in effect at the beginning of November 1, 1979."
