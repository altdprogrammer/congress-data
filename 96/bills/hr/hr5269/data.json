Authorizes appropriations to such Commission for improvements of facilities and capital liabilities of the Panama Canal Company and Canal Zone Government. Establishes ceilings on the appropriations for specified categories of projects. Permits the amount that may be expended for any one project to be increased above the amount specified for such project upon approval by the Board of the Commission and notification of the appropriate congressional committees. Prohibits appropriations to or for such Commission in excess of: (1) the revenues to be deposited in the Panama Canal Commission Fund during that fiscal year; and (2) the remaining revenues deposited in prior fiscal years. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress the actual amount of revenues deposited in such Fund. Exempts appropriations for the Canal Zone Government and the Panama Canal Emergency Fund from such limitations. Permits continuing contracts for programs as long as any such contract does not exceed in the aggregate the total amount for each specified program. Requires any spending authority to be provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Authorizes the U.S. Surgeon General to continue to provide medical, surgical, and dental treatment and hospitalization to those entitled to such treatment and hospitalization during fiscal year 1980 and the Panama Canal Treaty transition period."
