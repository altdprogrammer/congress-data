    "text": "(Reported to House from Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce with amendment, H. Rept. 96-1156 (Part III)) Nuclear Waste, Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Energy, within 60 days of the enactment of this Act, to establish a research, development, and demonstration program for the disposal of high level radioactive waste (spent nuclear fuel and the highly radioactive wastes resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid wastes and dry solid material derived from such liquid waste). Requires the Secretary to identify four potential repository sites located in different geologic media, and to the extent practicable, in different regions of the continental United States. Directs the Secretary to undertake site characterization activities (exploration and study of the geologic conditions of a particular site) to determine the suitability of such sites as demonstration repositories. Requires the Secretary to conduct at such sites tests to provide the data necessary for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and to report thereon to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Directs the Secretary to make the final site selections as soon as possible and set up the demonstration repositories at such sites. Requires that the first demonstration repository be in operation by the end of fiscal year 1986, the second repository be in operation by the end of fiscal year 1987, and the third and fourth repositories be in operation at a time prescribed by subsequent legislation. Sets forth design requirements for such repositories. Prohibits the disposal of high level radioactive waste in a demonstration repository unless: (1) such waste is owned by the Federal Government and is the result of unlicensed activities; (2) such waste is retrievable; and (3) a place has been identified to receive such waste after the termination of the demonstration program. Prohibits the operation of any demonstration repository beyond the year 2000. Authorizes the Secretary to place in such repositories solidified high level radioactive waste in canisters contained in engineered barriers. Directs the Secretary to consult with the NRC on the development of such barriers. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the NRC to arrange for review and consultation concerning the demonstration program by the NRC, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to submit to the NRC information which the NRC requires to identify any danger to public health and safety from such program. Prohibits the Secretary from excavating any site for a demonstration repository without NRC approval. Directs the Secretary to afford the NRC access to the demonstration repositories to assure the public health and safety. Directs the Secretary to consult and coordinate on a continuing basis with the officials of each State in which the Secretary intends to locate a demonstration repository. Requires the Secretary to hold public hearings on the demonstration program near all potential repository sites. Requires that all demonstration facilities authorized by this Act be constructed and operated as research, development, and demonstration facilities pursuant to the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Directs the NRC to issue an order to the Secretary to cease any activity which presents a danger to public health and safety. Requires the NRC to publish such order in the Federal Register and give notice of and hold a public hearing on such order. Directs the NRC to affirm, revise, or rescind such order upon completion of such hearing. Prohibits the Secretary from conducting any activity prohibited by the NRC. Requires the Secretary to take such actions as may be required by an order by the NRC. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the NRC, to submit to Congress an annual report on the demonstration program. Requires the Secretary to conduct a study on techniques for disposal of low level radioactive waste and report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate by June 1, 1981."
