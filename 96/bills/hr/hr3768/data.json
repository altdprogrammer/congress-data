    "text": "Amtrak Reorganization Act of 1979 - Title I: Findings, Goals, and Definitions - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to set forth goals for Amtrak with respect to: (1) improved on-time performance; (2) coverage of operating costs from revenue; and (3) improvement of State-subsidized service. Defines terms as used in this Act. Title II: Amtrak Management Improvement - Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to submit to the Congress and the President, by January 1, 1981, a comprehensive plan for the improvement of all intercity rail passenger service provided in the basic system. Specifies assessments to be included in such plan. Directs the Corporation to establish an Employee Incentive Program to provide recognition awards to individuals, labor organizations, or carriers for outstanding achievements in meeting performance goals. Directs the Commission to establish an employee stock ownership plan. Directs the Corporation to establish a Regional Maintenance Plan by January 1, 1980, which shall include: (1) a systemwide inventory of spare parts; (2) the establishment of the necessary number of maintenance employees; (3) the establishment of a systematic preventive maintenance program; and (4) a method for the periodic evaluation of maintenance costs, time lags, and parts shortages with appropriate corrective actions. Directs the Corporation to establish a Performance Evaluation Center to conduct an ongoing review of Amtrak operations. Requires the Center to submit a report of its activities and recommendations every six months to the appropriate authorizing committees of both houses of Congress and to the Secretary of Transporation. Authorizes the President of the Corporation to require the conductor of any Amtrak train to report any inadequacy of train operation to the Center. Repeals the adequacy of service provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act. Directs the Corporation, by July 1, 1979, to implement a Job Placement Program for employees who will be affected by the reduction in work force caused by the implementation of the Secretary's Route Restructuring Plan. Directs the Corporation, by January 1, 1980, to institute a Model Rehabilitation Program for employees sustaining major injuries within the scope of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a Compensation Assessment Commission to evaluate the salary and wages paid to officers and employees of Amtrak and to recommend means to carry out the employee stock ownership plan required by this Act. Requires the Commissioner to submit its report to the Secretary and the Congress by July 1, 1980. Title III: Contract Carrier Incentives and Coordination - Directs the Corporation to enter into a contract with railroad carriers on an industrywide basis to establish rights for the operation of special or charter trains between specific points upon the provision of reasonable notice, not to exceed seven days, to the carriers involved in the operation of any special or charter trains. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Carrier Coordination Committee to review and evaluate ways for improving cooperation between the Corporation and carriers having a contract for regularly scheduled service with the Corporation to improve intercity rail passenger service. Directs the Committee to submit annual reports to Congress on its activities. Directs the Corporation, by January 1, 1980, to institute a reduced fare schedule, on a space available basis, for: (1) persons 65 years of age or older; (2) government employees traveling on official business; and (3) railroad employees, retired railroad employees, and other persons eligible for reduced or free transportation prior to the enactment of this Act. Stipulates that agreements between the Corporation and a railroad may include terms for an incentive for the achievement of a certain level of on-time performance. Reduces such payments for failure to achieve on-time performance. Title IV: State Subsidy Programs - Directs the Secretary to convene a technical assistance panel to determine measures for reducing avoidable costs for rail service outside the basic system which is requested by a State or a group of States. Stipulates that if such service is approved the Corporation shall be reimbursed for 100 percent of the avoidable costs of providing such service together with a reasonable return on the value of Amtrak properties used for such service. Stipulates that 50 percent of such amount shall be provided by the requesting States and 50 percent shall be provided by such States from Federal financial assistance provided under this Act. Repeals the provision of the Rail Passenger Service Act which requires the Corporation to initiate at least one experimental route each year. Title V: Tax Incentives - Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to entitle rail carriers which make improvements in their railroad tracks used by the Corporation to a tax credit. Entitles rail carriers to an additional ten percent tax credit for railroad energy property as defined in this Act. Title VI: Authorization for Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for the benefit of the Corporation for fiscal years 1980 through 1982. Title VII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes the Corporation to hire railroad police. Excludes the Corporation from the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to the issuance of securities or the assumption of any obligation or liability in respect to the securities of others. Authorizes the Corporation to establish through rates and joint fares with any domestic or international motor, air, or water carrier (previously such arrangements could only be made with motor carriers). Stipulates that after October 1, 1979, all route additions or discontinuances to the basic system shall be made in accordance with the Route and Service Criteria. Authorizes any State, regional, or local agency to request the Secretary to convene a Regional Rail Utilization Panel to consider the commuter rail service needs of a particular State, region, or locality. Requires the Secretary to convene such a panel upon request. Directs the panel to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to such service including recommendations with respect to the appropriate party to provide such service."
