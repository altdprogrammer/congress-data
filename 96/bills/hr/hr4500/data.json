    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-06-15", 
    "text": "Title I: Demonstrations of Near-Term Energy Technologies - Directs the Secretary of Energy to solicit proposals for commercial demonstration of any of the energy technologies covered by the Federal Non-nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, including solar, geothermal, synthetic fuels, and energy conservation technologies. Requires that such proposals be reviewed within 90 days and transmitted to the Congress with recommendations. Title II: Department of Energy Project Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 and subsequent years for a variety of energy development, demonstration, and commercialization projects for solvent refined coal, high and low Btu coal gasification, geothermal energy, oil shale, fuel cells, fluidized bed combustion, and urban and industrial waste. Title III: Oil Shale - Establishes a program to determine the commercial viability of oil shale retorting technologies. Directs the Secretary to solicit proposals for the design, construction, and initial operation of Federal oil-shale commercial demonstration projects. Sets forth criteria for selecting, locating, and evaluating such projects with respect to their economic viability and their social, environmental, and economic impacts on local communities. Establishes a Social and Environmental Impact Advisory Panel to advise the Secretary on matters relating to the oil shale program, including impacts on State and local governments, environmental, health and safety effects of the test facilities, and measures for preventing or mitigating such impacts. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee and make commitments to guarantee the payment of interest on obligations for financing essential community development and planning resulting from this title. Sets the maximum amount of obligations to be guaranteed under this title at $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State and local governments for studying and planning for mitigation of the potential economic, environmental, and social impacts of projects authorized by this title and for establishing related management expertise. Authorizes the appropriation of $200,000 for such grants for fiscal year 1980. Establishes in the Department of the Treasury the Oil Shale Commercialization Test Special Fund for the purpose of providing funds for impact assistance as prescribed by this title. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of specified agencies and departments, to prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of information and evaluation of the impacts of the oil shale program. Specifies the components of such plan. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to Congress an annual report on activities conducted under this Act. Makes the information collected by the Secretary pursuant to this title available to the public. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 to carry out the provisions of this Act. Title IV: Oil and Gas Leasing - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a five-year program to lease on-shore Federal lands for oil and gas exploration, development, and production. Requires expedited decisions on leasing applications and expanded use of competitive bidding. Requires lessees to describe exploration activities in an exploration plan, and to describe development and production activities in a development and production plan, prior to obtaining the Secretary's approval of such activities. Makes provision for assuring the protection of non-energy resources on such lands as are leased under this title. Limits judicial review of and relief from the Secretary's actions or determinations to those cases where any such action or determination is found to be arbitrary or capricious. Title V: Renewable Energy Resources - Establishes a national goal of 20 quadrillion Btu's of energy to be supplied by the year 2000 from renewable energy resources such as, solar energy, wind and urban waste systems. Establishes the Solar Heating and Cooling Information Center to provide information on renewable energy resources. Requires the inclusion of cost-effective solar systems in new Federal buildings, the construction of renewable energy generating facilities by the Federal power administrations, and the making of federally-subsidized low-interest loans for the purchase and installaiton of solar energy systems by owners or builders of commercial and residential structures. Directs the heads of each Federal agency operating a fueling station for certain gasoline motor vehicles to require that such stations only dispense ten percent alcohol-blended gasoline. Directs the head of each Federal agency operating a retail gasoline supply outlet to require that such outlets offer for retail sale ten percent alcohol-blended gasoline. Establishes within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Solar Programs a solar energy commercialization loan program to administer the low-interest loan program. Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 for such loans program. Establishes as wind energy program objectives to reach by fiscal year 1986, a total megawatt capacity in the United States from wind energy systems of 500 megawatts and a reduction of the average cost of wind-generated electricity to a level competitive with conventional energy sources. Directs the Secretary to establish research, development, and demonstration programs to promote the use of wind-energy systems by means of Federal financial assistance, subsidies, and contract awards. Establishes a wind energy commercialization program for the accelerated procurement and installation of wind energy systems in Federal facilities. Establishes an advisory committee to assist the Secretary in performing his duties relating to the wind energy program. Authorizes the appropriation of $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 to carry out this Act, of which $100,000,000 shall be used for the wind energy program. Title VI: Study of World Oil Supply and Production Opportunities - Directs the Secretary of Energy to prepare and submit to Congress a study of world oil supply and production opportunities in non-OPEC countries, including an evaluation of alternative policies for increasing exploration and production, and an assessment of present United States initiatives and potential for new oil discoveries."
