    "text": "Alien Education Impact Aid Act of 1980 - Title I: General Provisions - Defines the terms used in this Act, including the term \"alien children\" which is defined to mean undocumented aliens to whom State or local educational agencies must provide educational services under Federal court order. Authorizes lump-sum appropriations for fiscal years 1981-1983 for State educational programs and administrative costs (up to one percent) under this Act. Provides that such entitlements shall be ratably reduced if sufficient funds are not available. Authorizes up to one percent of such funds for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to withhold funds from State educational agencies that fail to meet the requirements of this Act. Sets forth the procedures to be followed in such a situation. Title II: General Assistance for Local Educational Agencies - Directs the Secretary to make payments to State educational agencies for fiscal years 1981-1983 for assistance in providing basic education for alien children. States that such payments shall be $450 for each such child enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools. Sets forth State application requirements. Requires the Secretary to give notice and opportunity for a hearing before final disapproval of an application. Title III: Special Impact Assistance for Substantial Increases in Attendance of Alien Children - Directs the Secretary to make payments to State educational agencies for fiscal years 1981-1983 for supplementary public education costs for alien children in public and private elementary and secondary schools in eligible local educational agencies (based on the number of such children in their jurisdiction). Authorizes: (1) for fiscal year 1981, $750 for each child; (2) for fiscal year 1982, $750 for each new child, and $500 for each child enrolled in 1981; and (3) for fiscal year 1983, $750 for each new child, $500 for a child enrolled in either 1981 or 1982, and $350 for a child enrolled in both 1981 and 1982. Includes within such supplementary services, English language instruction, bilingual education, special materials and supplies, additional basic instructional services, and inservice training. Sets forth State application requirements. Requires a State educational agency to give notice and an opportunity for a hearing before final disapproval of a local educational agency's application for such funds."
