Title I: Meeting the Needs of the Chronically Mentally Ill - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to any State Agency (designated under the State plan pursuant to title VI of this Act): (1) for specified projects, including the planning and coordination of mental health and support services, identifying State-level barriers to the availability of such services to the chronically mentally ill, and improving the competency of mental health service personnel; and (2) for payments to any Core Service Agency (a public or nonprofit private entity designated by the State Agency to develop and promote mental health and support services to priority population groups) for such projects and additional activities, including educational and information services. Title II: Prevention of Mental Illness - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any State Agency for specified projects, including the planning and coordination of mental illness prevention activities, information services and demonstration projects related to mental illness prevention, and in-service and other training of health personnel in mental illness prevention measures. Title III: State Mental Health Systems Improvement - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any State Agency to improve the administration of mental health programs. Title IV: Community Mental Health Services - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public or nonprofit private entities: (1) to prepare for providing mental health services (but only one grant not to exceed $75,000 may be made with respect to a mental health services area); (2) for projects providing mental health services to one or more priority population groups (with preference given to an entity serving an area which has no community mental health center); (3) for projects to develop comprehensive mental health services; (4) which are ambulatory health care centers or are affiliated with such centers and provide emergency, outpatient, and consultation and education services; (5) for the provision of mental health services which generally do not generate revenues; and (6) for projects to provide continued mental health services. Title V: Pilot Projects for State Administration of Grants - Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with any State Agency for a demonstration project under which such Agency will pay the Federal funds due to entities for activities authorized by title IV of this Act or for assistance to Core Service Agencies and will perform other agreed-upon functions. Title VI: Requirements for Participation; Authorizations - Requires a State to have in effect a mental health services plan which is consistent with the State health plan prepared in accordance with title XV of the Public Health Service Act (National Health Planning and Development) in order for the State Agency or any entity in such State to be eligible for grants under this Act. Specifies the content of such plans. Directs the Secretary to prescribe quality standards for mental health services. Allows grants to be made under title IV of this Act to any Indian tribe or urban Indian organization for projects serving members of such tribe or organization. Amends title III of the Public Health Service Act (General Powers and Duties) to require individuals who receive a clinical traineeship in psychology, psychiatry, nursing, or social work with respect to mental health to serve, at the rate of one year for each year of the traineeship: (1) in a State mental institution; (2) for any entity eligible for a grant under title IV of this Act; (3) in a health manpower shortage area; or (4) in other service as determined by the Secretary.
