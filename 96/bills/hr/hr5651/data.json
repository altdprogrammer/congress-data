Requires members of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police force with 20 or more years of service, who are detailed to the Capitol Police, to either be: (1) reassigned to the Metropolitan Police or (2) elect to transfer to the Capitol Police. Treats any police service of the Chief of the Capitol Police and members of the Metropolitan Police who transfer to the Captiol Police as creditable service as congressional employees for purposes of civil service annuities. Stipulates that such individuals forfeit all annuity rights under the Policemen and Firemen's Retirement and Disability Act. Requires the District of Columbia Mayor to pay the total amount of retirement withholdings and contributions for such individuals to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund."
