    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a land diversion payment program for the 1980 crop of feed grains to divert from production 12,000,000 metric tons of such grains. Requires, as a condition of eligibility for such payments, that feed grain producers devote to approved conservation uses not less than 15 percent of their 1980 crop planted acreage. Set forth a formula for determining the amount of such payments. Sets payment rates, for purposes of such formula, at not less than $1.25 per bushel for corn and at a fair and reasonable rate in relation to such corn rate, as determined by the Secretary, for all other feed grains. Directs the Secretary to establish a land diversion payment program for the 1980 crop of wheat to divert from production 4,000,000 metric tons of wheat. Requires, as a condition of eligibility for such payments, that wheat producers devote to approved conservation uses not less than ten percent of their 1980 crop planted acreage. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of such payments. Sets payment rates, for purposes of such formula, at not less than $1.50 per bushel. Directs the Secretary to implement and administer a special grazing and hay program for the 1980 crop year. Sets payments rates for the 1980 crop of wheat under such program at not less than $0.50 per bushel."
