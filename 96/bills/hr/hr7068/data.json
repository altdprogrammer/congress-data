Provides a procedure for reducing the retired pay of members of the Uniformed Services who are concurrently receiving earned income. Sets forth provisions for determining the retired grade of Navy and Marine Corps officers. Title II: Entitlement of Members of the Uniformed Services to Retired Pay - Makes members of the Uniformed Services eligible for retired pay after five years of creditable service, including enlisted personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard. Sets forth the procedure for effecting the amendments made by this title with respect to current members of the Services and newly enlisted members. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Provides a procedure for cost-of-living adjustments for: (1) retired or retainer pay of members of the Uniformed Services (presently adjusted with respect to the Consumer Price Index); and (2) retirement annuities of Central Intelligence Agency personnel. Sets forth the limitations on crediting years of service for retirement benefits and including such years as credit toward any annuity, pension, or old-age benefits. Eliminates the entitlement of severance pay for warrant officers, personnel of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and commissioned officers of the Coast Guard and Geodetic Survey."
