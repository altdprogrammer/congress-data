    "text": "Cartel Restriction Act of 1979 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to require any U.S. person, partnership, or corporation to notify the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General, if it is requested to engage, or is engaged in concert with any competing foreign concern, in: (1) establishing prices; (2) allocating markets or customers; or (3) restricting the availability of any product or service. Requires any U.S. person, partnership, or corporation engaged in a joint venture with a foreign concern which is engaged in such activities to notify the Commission and the Attorney General. Directs the Commission to, in turn, notify the Secretary of State, the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Establishes civil penalties for violations of such notification requirements. Directs the Commission to require that such notice contain information which will enable the Commission to determine whether certain trade practices violate this Act or any antitrust Act. Prohibits courts enforcing this Act or any antitrust Act from declining jurisdiction solely on the ground that the complaint would require the court to examine the motivation for the official action of a foreign state. Requires courts to take into account the vital national interests of the United States and the foreign state and U.S. commercial interests in determining whether to exercise jurisdiction in a case involving laws of a foreign state which are inconsistent with this Act or the antitrust Acts."
