    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) Veterans' Disability Compensation and Housing Benefits Amendments of 1980 =Title I: Veterans' Disability Compensation Benefits= - Increases the rates of veterans' compensation for: (1) wartime disability compensation; (2) additional compensation for dependents; and (3) clothing allowances paid to certain disabled veterans. Provides such increases at 14.3 percent for veterans rates 50 percent or more disabled, and 13 percent for veterans rated 10 through 40 percent disabled. =Title II: Survivors' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Benefits= - Increases the rates of veterans' dependency and indemnity compensation for: (1) a surviving spouse; (2) surviving children; and (3) supplemental children's benefits. =Title III: Special Home Adaptation Grants for Certain Severely Disabled Veterans= - Provides specially adapted housing assistance to severely disabled veterans, due to blindness or loss, or loss of use, of both upper extremities (including both hands), limited to a maximum of $5,000. Directs that such assistance be granted to any such veteran not more than once. =Title IV: Veterans' Administration Home-Loan Program Amendments= - Enables veterans who have used their Veterans Administration (VA) loan guaranty entitlement for the purchase of a conventional home, condominium, or mobile home to refinance such loan at a lower interest rate with a VA loan refinancing guaranty. Increases the maximum loan guaranty for such dwellings. Limits the refinancing guaranty to the amount of guaranty on the loan to be refinanced. =Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Extends the authority for the Veterans' Administration regional office in the Republic of the Philippines until September 30, 1985. Authorizes the Administrator to furnish headstones and markers, upon request, for specified relatives of veterans who are buried in a State veterans' cemetery. Removes the prohibition on concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA need-based pension benefits. Provides for pension payments to a hospitalized veteran having neither spouse nor child if such veteran is readmitted within six months of a period of care. Limits the amount of compensation for a service-connected disability and dependency and indemnity compensation for any veteran imprisoned in a Federal, State, or local penal institution (except as a part of a work-release program) as a result of conviction of a felony. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to apportion and pay to such veteran's spouse, children, or dependent parents the compensation such veteran would have received but for such veteran's incarceration. Provides for the confidentiality of all records and documents which are part of any Veterans' Administration medical quality assurance program. Stipulates that disclosure of such material may be made only under specified circumstances (unlawful disclosure to be punishable by fine), including: (1) Congressional oversight functions; (2) government or private licensing and accreditation functions; (3) statutory functions; and (4) public health or safety or emergency functions. Defines \"medical quality assurance programs\" for purposes of this Act. Sets forth the minimum number of personnel to be employed by the American Battle Monument Commission for the care and maintenance of the cemeteries, monuments, and memorials under the jurisdiction of such Commission. Permits the Administrator to convey certain lands to the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming, for roadway expansion. Requires that any deed of conveyance made for such roadway: (1) does not interfere with the care and treatment of patients in the Veterans' Administration Center in Cheyenne; (2) contains such restrictions necessary to protect the interests of the United States; and (3) provides that any violation of such deed by the city shall result in reversion of the deed to the United States without payment of compensation. Makes certain technical amendments. =Title VI: Effective Dates= - Sets forth effective dates for provisions of this Act."
