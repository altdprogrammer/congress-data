    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to make the Secretary of Agriculture responsible for the administration of the Forth Fork of the American River in the State of California. Designates specified segments of the following rivers for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system: (1) Myakka, Florida; (2) Saint Lucie, Florida; (3) Salmon, Connecticut; (4) Farmington, Connecticut; (5) Parker, Massachusetts; (6) Caney Fork, Tennessee; (7) Dan, North Carolina and Virginia; (8) Satilla River, Georgia; (9) Cimarron, Kansas and Oklahoma; (10) Hoh, Washington; (11) Dosewallips, Washington; (12) Quillayute, Washington; (13) Niobrara, Nebraska; and (14) Dismal, Nebraska. Requires the Study of the Farmington River, Connecticut, to include an analysis of whether low-head hydroelectric generating facilities can be installed on such river at dams existing on the date of enactment of this Act without having a direct and adverse effect upon the fish, wildlife, recreational, and esthetic values of the river. Requires that the study of the Salmon River and the Farmington River, in Connecticut, and the Hoh River, Dosewallips River, and Quillayute River, in Washington, include an analysis of the various means which may be practicable and appropriate, consistent with other provisions of this Act, to maintain and enhance the fisheries resources of such rivers. Designates specified segments of the following rivers as components of the national wild and scenic rivers system: (1) the North Umpqua and the Illinois Rivers both in the State of Oregon; (2) the Dosewallips River in the State of Washington; and (3) the American River in the State of California. Declares that nothing in this Act shall prevent, prohibit, or otherwise affect the operation and maintenance of existing flood control works associated with the designated segment of the American River, California. Requires the agency charged with the administration of each designated component of the national wild and scenic rivers system to establish detailed boundaries therefor and determine which class outlined in such Act best fits the river or its various segments, within one year from the date of designation of such component (formerly within one year from the date of such Act). Eliminates the requirement that such an agency prepare a plan for the necessary developments in connection with the administration of such a river. Requires an agency charged with the administration of each such component, within specified time periods, to prepare a comprehensive protection and management plan to guide the agency's administration in accordance with the classification made under such Act. Requires that such plan: (1) include the identification of and plans for implementation of, user carrying capacities for all types of public use activities within the boundaries of the river; and (2) be prepared after consultation with State and local governments and the interested public. Limits authority to enter into contractual agreements and to make payments under this Act pursuant to such contractual agreements, to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts."
