Permits the continued use of an unsafe quantity of nitrite under such conditions until an alternative and feasible means of preventing the development of botulism is available. States that a food shall be deemed adulterated if it contains quantities of nitrite in excess of those permitted under this Act. Directs the Secretaries of Health, Education, and Welfare and Agriculture to annually review the regulations issued under this Act. Requires that all action taken under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act be consistent with the provisions of this Act."
