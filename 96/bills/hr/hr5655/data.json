    "text": "Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to include highly migratory species within the exclusive management authority of the United States until an international regime for the conservation and management of such species is established. Revises the definition of \"highly migratory species\" to include all fish rather than only tuna. Sets forth the objectives of an international organization concerned with the conservation and management of such species. Declares that the conservation of cetaceans should be exercised by an international organization with authority to regulate the exploitation of cetacean. Stipulates that any nation may more strictly regulate the exploitation of cetaceans within its own fishery conservation zone. Authorizes the President to prohibit the importation of fish products from any country failing to cooperate with or adhere to international efforts for the conservation and management of highly migratory species and cetaceans. Directs the Secretary of State to convene a conference for the purpose of establishing an international management regime for the conservation and management of highly migratory species."
