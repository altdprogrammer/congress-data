Defines an \"employer-related scholarship program\" as one which: (1) provides grants for study at educational institutions eligible to receive tax deductible charitable contributions; and (2) limits the eligibility for all or a portion of such grants to employees of a particular employer (or group of employers), or to members of such employees' families."
