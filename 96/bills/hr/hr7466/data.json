    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes the head of each executive agency and the Library of Congress to employ personal assistants, who shall serve without pay from the agency, to assist a handicapped employee to perform the employee's official duties. Permits such a personal assistant to receive pay for his or her services from the handicapped employee or a nonprofit organization. Defines the term \"handicapped employee\" as an individual employed by an agency who is blind or deaf or who otherwise qualifies as a handicapped individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Authorizes the head of an agency: (1) to employ personal assistants to handicapped employees as regular civil service employees; and (2) to authorize the payment of an individual to accompany and assist a handicapped employee traveling on official business. Limits the amount payable to such individual. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be held to prevent the assignment to a handicapped employee by an agency of clerical or secretarial assistance normally provided to an employee. Amends the Federal Advisory Committee Act to permit handicapped members of Federal advisory committees to be provided the services of personal assistants. Allows a Federal employee with at least five years of creditable civilian service for purposes of civil service retirement to receive retirement credit for congressional campaign committee service if the employee has at least five years service on such a committee as of the effective date of this Act."
