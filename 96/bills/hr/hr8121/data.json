Requires the Corporation to have a Board of Directors. Applies specified provisions of the Department of Energy Organization Act to the Corporation, the Board, and its officers and employees. Directs the President of the Corporation to conduct a study and report to Congress on financing the acquisition of crude oil for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by methods other than directly purchasing crude oil with appropriated funds. Sets forth elements to be included in such study. Terminates all authority for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and any regulation issued pursuant to such authority on September 30, 2000. Repeals references to the Early Storage Reserve Plan. Declares that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan shall store a specified amount of crude oil by December 31, 1987."
