    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Designates the Federal Building in Trenton, North Carolina, as the John D. Larkins, Jr., Federal Building. Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to make a grant to each eligible local educational agency for the construction of school facilities in order to assist such agencies in providing education to immigrant children. Specifies that the amount of such grant to which a local educational agency is entitled shall be equal to the number of immigrant children aged five through 17, inclusive, who are enrolled at the schools of that agency and for whom that agency provided free public education during the school year 1978-79, multiplied by $1,000. Makes a local education agency eligible to receive such a grant if the number of immigrant children enrolled during such year at the schools of that agency is equal to or greater than 50 and is equal to seven percent or more of all children aged five through 17, inclusive, who are enrolled at such school during each year. Prohibits any immigrant child from being counted for the purpose of such grant unless: (1) the parents of such child reside within the school district of such agency; (2) the guardian of such child resides within the school district of such agency; (3) the individual having lawful control of the immigrant child resides within the school district of such agency; or (4) such child resides within the school district of such agency. Permits the Secretary to make determinations with respect to the number of immigrant children within the school district of any agency, whenever actual satisfication data is not available, on the basis of estimates. Declares that a local educational agency shall not be eligible for such a grant if the Secretary determines that the amount determined for such agency is not adequate to provide such agency with any meaningful assistance in the education of immigrant children. Makes specified funds authorized to be appropriated under such Act available for making such grants for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Specifies that no local educational agency shall be entitled to any such grant unless that agency submits an application to the Secretary which meets certain requirements. Prohibits the Secretary from finally disapproving an application of a local educational agency except after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to such agency. Directs the Secretary, whenever the Secretary finds that there is failure to meet the requirements for such grant, to notify such agency that further payments will not be made until the Secretary is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply."
