Rept. 96-942 (Part II)) Hazardous Materials Transportation and Independent Safety Board Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to authorize appropriations to carry out the provisions of such Act for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter into a contract with a private entity for the use of a supplemental reporting system and data center to provide specified individuals with information concerning the transportation of hazardous materials. Amends the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for the purposes of such Act for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983. Directs that such sums shall remain available until expended. Directs that National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations (other than those concerning specified railroad accidents and major marine casualties) shall have priority over all other investigations of such accidents conducted by other Federal agencies. Includes aviation incidents under requirements binding on persons reporting such incidents subject to the Board's investigatory jurisdiction. Specifies that any properly credentialed employee of the Board, in investigating a transportation accident, may take custody of any materials determined to be required for the purpose of the investigation."
