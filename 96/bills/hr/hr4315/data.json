    "text": "Technology Transfer Control Act of 1979 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to state that goods and technology may contribute to the military potential of possible adversary nations. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to prohibit the transfer to any Communist country of goods or technology which have any potential for military, law enforcement, or intelligence gathering purposes and to encourage friendly countries to exercise similar controls. Authorizes the President to impose export controls on articles and technical data for national security purposes regardless of their availability from sources outside the United States. Directs the President to require a license for the export of goods and technology to any Communist country. Provides a procedure for Congress to disapprove the issuance of such license. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to review any proposed export of goods or technology to any Communist country and recommend disapproval if such export has potential military, law enforcement, or intelligence gathering value which could prove detrimental to the national security of the United States."
