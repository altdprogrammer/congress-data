    "text": "Export Promotion and Trade Association Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the Department of Commerce an office to promote export trade associations. Exempts certified export trade associations from the antitrust laws, unless certain conditions exist. Authorizes Federal agencies only to enforce the provisions regarding such associations. Permits third parties to file petitions requesting enforcement action with the Secretary. Permits corporations to acquire the stock of any corporation organized solely for export trade purposes, unless such acquisition restrains trade or substantially lessens competition in the United States. Limits the prohibition against unfair methods of competition to domestic competitors engaged in export trade. Sets forth the procedure for obtaining certification as an organization engaged solely in export trade. Provides for appeal of the Secretary's denial of certification. Requires the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, to publish guidelines for determining whether an association will meet the certification requirements. Requires certified associations to submit annual reports to the Secretary. Provides for automatic certification of existing associations. Stipulates that all applications for certification be kept confidential with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Secretary to require an association to modify its operation to be consistent with international obligations of the United States. Directs the President to appoint a task force seven years after enactment to examine the effect of this Act and to make recommendations. Repeals the Webb-Pomerene Act."
