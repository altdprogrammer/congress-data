Stipulates that affirmative action programs shall be designed to expand the pool of applicants. Prohibits Federal officers, employees, or courts from finding discrimination based solely on the composition of the work force or membership of an employer, employment agency, or labor organization. Requires such officers, employees, or courts to find that an act of discrimination has been committed before relief can be granted. Prohibits requiring employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, grantees, or contractors to collect data regarding the composition of their work force or membership, except pursuant to discovery procedures."
