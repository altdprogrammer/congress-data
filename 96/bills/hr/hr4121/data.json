Stipulates that internal inspection units within bureaus of the Department shall retain their primary responsibility to receive such information and conduct investigations.

Authorizes the Counsel to refer matters involving violations of law to the appropriate investigative agency and matters not involving violations of law to the appropriate office, division, bureau, or board, or its internal inspection unit. Allows the Counsel to assign a task force or individual to undertake an investigation. Directs the Counsel to submit to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General or the Solicitor General reports on its activities and any finding of violations of laws to the Judiciary Committees of Congress. Establishes a Committee on Professional Responsibility, consisting of Department officials designated by the Attorney General, to advise the Counsel."
