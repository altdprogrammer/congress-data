    "text": "Amends the highway safety program to require State programs to provide for a program to assure the installation and use of road speed governors on trucks using public roads in such State. Defines the term \"road speed governor\" to mean any device which is designed to limit the maximum speed of a truck to 55 miles per hour. Requires the installation of such a device on all trucks manufactured after model year 1981. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to require that each truck licensed by any State to be operated on a public road constructed or maintained with Federal funds have a road speed governor installed by January 1, 1982. Prohibits the disconnection or the rendering inoperative of such device. Directs the Secretary to establish exemptions from such requirements where compliance would not be practicable. Directs the Secretary to establish an inspection and compliance monitoring program to be coordinated with other Federal and State laws. Applies the information and certification requirements applicable to bumper standards for passenger automobiles to road speed governor standards for trucks. Establishes a civil penalty for the noninstallation of or tampering with a road speed governor. Directs the President to require that all trucks used by any Executive agency, directly or indirectly, be equipped with a speed governor after fiscal year 1981. Directs the Secretary to prescribe minimum performance standards for road speed governors."
