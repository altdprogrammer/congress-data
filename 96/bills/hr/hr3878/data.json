    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-05-02", 
    "text": "Tuition Tax Relief Act of 1979 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers an income tax credit equal to 50 percent of the tuition costs incurred by such taxpayers for their higher education or that of their spouses or dependents. Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $250 for calendar years 1979 and 1980, and $500 for calendar year 1981 and thereafter. Treats tuition payments as paid for calendar year 1979 if such payments are made on or after August 1, 1979, and before February 1, 1980, for education furnished on or after August 1, 1979, and before January 1, 1980, and for calendar years after 1979 if such payments are made during the particular calendar year or within one month of the beginning or close of such calendar year for education furnished during that year. Excludes graduate students from eligibility for the credit. Requires full-time or qualified half-time attendance at an eligible educational institution (college or post-secondary vocational school). Excludes from the definition of \"tuition\" any amounts paid for books, supplies, and equipment for courses of instruction, or meals, lodging, transportation, and other living expenses. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school except to the extent necessary to determine whether such school is an eligible educational institution. Requires the disregard of any amount received by the taxpayer as a tuition tax credit for purposes of determining the eligibility of the taxpayer for Federal or State educational assistance."
