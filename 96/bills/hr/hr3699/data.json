    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prevent nuclear reactor repair costs and increased costs of substitute power from being passed through to an electric utility's customers when the generation of electric energy by any nuclear powerplant is suspended or terminated for a safety related reason. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to extend loans to any electric utility to cover such excess costs. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to receive assurances from any electric utility demonstrating that it will be able to pay such excess costs before issuing an operating license to the utility for a nuclear reactor. States that such assurances may include contracts for insurance, agreements for indemnity, and other measures that the Commission deems appropriate. Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from extending loans to an electric utility to cover the cost of providing such assurances."
