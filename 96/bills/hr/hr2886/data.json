Authorizes the Director of the Office of Rural Health to: (1) award grants, contracts, loans, and loan guarantees to public and nonprofit public entities for projects to examine existing models of rural health care delivery; (2) determine the applicability and transferability of such projects to other rural areas; and (3) assist in the study, planning, development, experimentation, and demonstration of rural health care delivery models. Conditions the provision of such assistance on a determination by the Director that it will increase the availability of health care services in rural areas where the Director has determined that adequate services are not available. Establishes in the Treasury a rural health care delivery loan guarantee and loan fund for the purposes of this Act. Establishes a Rural Health Care Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the Director with respect to the policies of the Office and the administration of this Act. Directs the Committee to report annually to Congress on the accomplishments of this Act."
