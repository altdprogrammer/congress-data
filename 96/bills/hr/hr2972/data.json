Provides that each written order and decision shall be in the language used in the trial or proceeding, except that on appeal all records and documents shall be in English. Prohibits the disqualification of persons on a grand or petit jury in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico solely because of a person's inability to speak, read, write and understand English if such person is able to speak, read, write, and understand the language in which the trial or proceeding is being conducted."
