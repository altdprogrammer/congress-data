    "text": "Congressional Salary Act of 1979 - Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to make any recommendations of the President relating to the salaries of Members of Congress, Delegates to the House of Representatives, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico purely advisory. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to require that the annual rate of pay for members of Congress, Delegates to the House of Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, and the Senate and House leadership be the rate payable for such positions on the date of enactment of this Act unless otherwise established by law. Prohibits any law increasing such rates of pay from taking effect before the first day of the Congress following the Congress during which such law is enacted. Requires any bill or resolution, or amendment thereto, providing for an increase in pay for such individuals to be adopted by a recorded vote. Declares such requirement to be an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Congress, and deems such requirement as part of the rules of each House."
