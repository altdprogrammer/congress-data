Requires the Postal Service: (1) to provide the supervisors' organization with a written description of any proposed program and any decision to implement the program; (2) to give the organization a specified period to make recommendations with respect to the program; (3) to give such recommendations full consideration; (4) to provide for the further participation of the organization in the development of an implemented program; and (5) to give the organization access to information to make such participation productive. Requires the Postal Service: (1) within 45 days after the adoption of a collective bargaining agreement between the Postal Service and its employees, to make a proposal for changes in the pay policies and fringe benefits for members of the supervisors' organization; and (2) to make a decision concerning such changes within 90 days following the submission of the proposal. Allows the supervisors' organization to request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to convene a factfinding panel concerning any such decision with which the organization disagrees. Sets forth the procedure for appointing the panel members. Directs the panel to make its recommendations concerning the differences between the Postal Service and the organization within 30 days after its appointment. Requires the Postal Service to consider such recommendations and to explain any differences between such recommendations and its final decision. Permits the Postal Service or the organization, not earlier than three years after enactment of this Act, to request the FMCS to convene a panel to review (1) the procedures and other provisions of this Act, and (2) the employment policy of the Postal Service. Directs the panel to recommend to Congress such changes in title 39 of the U.S. Code (Postal Service) as it finds appropriate."
