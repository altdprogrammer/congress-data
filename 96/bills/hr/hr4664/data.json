    "text": "Antitrust Consent Decree Enforcement Act of 1979 - Amends the Clayton Act to provide a procedure allowing any person damaged by a violation of an antitrust judgment to bring a civil action in the court in which such judgment was entered to obtain equitable and other relief. Requires a person, before bringing such an action, to notify the Attorney General of the suspected violation of an antitrust judgment. Requires the Attorney General to take specified actions before the private action provided for this Act may be taken. Stipulates that each separate violation of an antitrust judgment shall give rise to a separate claim for penalty not to exceed $10,000. Establishes a procedure permitting parties to antitrust judgments or any party injured by violation of such judgment to petition the Attorney General to review such judgment and thereafter to petition the district court that originally issued the judgment to vacate or modify it. Authorizes the Courts to grant equitable relief to effectuate an antitrust judgment and authorizes civil penalties for violations of judgments."
