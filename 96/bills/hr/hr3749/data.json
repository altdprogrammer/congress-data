    "text": "Coastal Area Liquefied Gas Facility Safety Act - Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to establish a coordinated Federal-State regulatory approach related to the siting, construction, and operation, of liquefied gas (LG) facilities located in or near the coastal zone. Directs the Secretary of Transporation to issue regulations setting forth minimum standards relating to the siting, construction, and operation of such facilities, based upon the best available technology. Specifies the nature of such standards for each such activity. Requires a public hearing before any decision is made as to the issuance of any Federal or State permit, license, or other authorization regarding LG facility siting, construction, or operation. Authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to exempt any State from the provisions of this Act upon a finding that such State has a LG facility law consistent with or stricter than the national standards prescribed under this Act, has an adequate enforcement mechanism, and has or is developing a coastal zone management program under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. Directs the Administrator to revoke such exemption in specified circumstances, and stipulates that if such revocation occurs, the siting, construction, and operation of such facility shall be regulated as prescribed under this Act. Prohibits the siting, construction, or operation, of any LG facility within or near the coastal zone of any State unless such State has applied for and has been granted exempt State status under this Act or unless the appropriate license has been issued. Sets forth application and hearing requirements and terms and conditions for such licenses. Authorizes the Administrator to deny, suspend, or revoke any such license in specified circumstances, provided that the applicant is given appropriate notice therefor and an opportunity to correct the deficiency within a reasonable time. Authorizes judicial review of such actions of the Administrator. States that the issuance of any license under this Act shall be deemed to be a \"major Federal action\" for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Directs the Administrator to consolidate and coordinate to the maximum extent practicable all Federal licenses, permits, other authorizations, and hearings relating to LG facility siting, construction, and operation. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for specified violations of this Act. Authorizes citizen suits in certain circumstances under specified conditions. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into appropriate interagency agreements to use the personnel services and facilities of other Federal agencies and departments. Sets forth reporting requirements relating to the administration of this Act, including a special report on financial responsibility and insurance needs associated with the risks of siting, construction, and operation, of LG facilities and the operation of LG vessels. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1981 and $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to carry out this Act. Stipulates that unless otherwise provided for in this Act, nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any provision of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968."
