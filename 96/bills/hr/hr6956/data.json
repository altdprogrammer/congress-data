Specifies that grants made to coastal states, by the Secretary of Commerce, for not more than 66 2/3 percent of the costs of administering such State's coastal zone management program shall continue to be made for a five-year period. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants for a decreasing percentage of the costs of administering such programs for the years following such five-year period, with the Federal share to reach 33 1/3 percent or less within three years after the last year of the five- year period. Directs the Secretary to require States which have completed one or more years of program implementation to devote increasing percentages of their implementation grants each year to activities leading to significant improvements to meet coastal management needs. Directs the Secretary to conduct a continuing review of the performance of coastal States with respect to coastal zone management which shall include evaluation findings during each grant period which assess each State's performance in the implementation of its management program. Sets forth the conditions under which the Secretary may withdraw management program approval and any financial assistance extended and withdraw any unexpended portion of such assistance to States. Requires the Secretary to conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the implementation of the coastal energy impact program. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any coastal State for the purpose of the preservation of islands. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the President for transmittal to the Congress on a biennial basis a report summarizing the administration of coastal zone management for the preceding two fiscal years. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1988 for the purpose of providing administrative coastal zone management program grants to States. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1985 for the purpose of providing grants for acquiring, developing, or operating estuarine sanctuaries, and through fiscal year 1982 for the purpose of providing grants for island preservation."
