Title IV: Department of Energy Project Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 and subsequent years for a variety of energy development, demonstration, and commercialization projects for solvent refined coal, high and low Btu gasification, geothermal energy, oil shale, fuel cells, fluidized bed combustion, and urban and industrial waste. Increases the number of small hydroelectric power plants eligible for Federal assistance. Title V: Oil Shale - Establishes a program to determine the commercial viability of oil shale retorting technologies. Directs the Secretary to solicit proposals for the design, construction, and initial operation of Federal oil-shale commercial demonstration projects. Sets forth criteria for selecting, locating, and evaluating such projects with respect to their economic viability and their social, environmental, and economic impacts on local communities. Establishes a Social and Environmental Impact Advisory Panel to advise the Secretary on matters relating to the oil shale program, including impacts on State and local governments, environmental, health, and safety effects of the test facilities, and measures for preventing or mitigating such impacts. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee and make commitments to guarantee the payment of interest on obligations for financing essential community development and planning resulting from this title. Sets the maximum amount of obligations to be guaranteed under this title at $20,000,000 for fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State and local governments for studying and planning for mitigation of the potential economic, environmental, and social impacts of projects authorized by this title and for establishing related management expertise. Authorizes the appropriation of $200,000 for such grants for fiscal year 1980. Establishes in the Department of the Treasury the Oil Shale Commercialization Test Special Fund for the purpose of providing funds for impact assistance as prescribed by this title. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of specified agencies and departments, to prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of information and evaluation of the impacts of the oil shale program. Specifies components of such plan. Requires that the Secretary prepare and submit to Congress an annual report on activities conducted under this Act. Makes the information collected by the Secretary pursuant to this title available to the public. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 to carry out the provisions of this Act. Title VI: Study of World Oil Supply and Production Opportunities - Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to Congress a study of world oil supply and production opportunities in non-OPEC countries, including an evaluation of alternative policies for increasing exploration and production, and an assessment of present United States initiatives and potential for new oil discoveries. Title VII: Oil and Gas Leasing - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a five-year program to lease on-shore Federal lands for oil and gas exploration, development, and production. Requires expedited decisions on leasing applications and expanded use of competitive bidding. Requires leases to describe exploration activities in an exploration plan, and to describe development and production activities in a development and production plan, prior to obtaining the Secretary's approval of such activities. Makes provision for assuring the protection of non-energy resources on such lands as are leased under this title. Limits judicial review and relief from the Secretary's actions or determinations to those cases where any such action on determination is found to be arbitrary or capricious. Title VIII: Gasohol - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program promoting the use of alcohol blended fuels. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate agencies, to conduct a study to determine the most suitable raw materials for the production of alcohol motor fuel and the nature of the alcohol motor fuel distribution system and production processes. Directs the Secretary to set mandatory annual production levels for alcohol fuels for the period of 1981 through 1990. Stipulates that the alcohol content of gasoline shall be increased from one percent to ten percent over the ten-year period. Imposes civil penalties upon refiners violating such production requirements. Requires any facility built for alcohol distillation pursuant to this title to give priority to the use of renewable energy resources as its operating fuel. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1979 to carry out the purposes of this title. Title IX: Short-Term Initiatives - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to implement a two-year program to require any petroleum-fueled commercial, industrial, or utility facility having a natural gas or coal capability to switch to the alternative fuel to replace the oil being used therein. Directs the FERC to order the installation of natural gas transportation facilities by pipeline owners to accommodate the fuel switching requirements of this subtitle.
