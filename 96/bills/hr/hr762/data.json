States that the Secretary shall establish uniform national standards of eligibility for the benefits to be provided under this Act, and establishes specified minimal classes of households and landlords as eligible for such benefits. Requires the State agency designated by the Secretary to administer this program to certify, under rules prescribed by the Secretary, the eligibility of households and landlords for benefits provided by this Act. States that a household or landlord may be certified for a period of not less than three nor more than 12 months. Directs the Secretary to pay to each such State agency 50 percent of its administration costs. Authorizes the Secretary to establish the percentage of utility expenses to eligible families that will be paid by the program according to the income of such family in relation to the maximum allowable income for eligibility for such family in relation to the maximum allowable income for eligibility for benefits under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to pay up to 90 percent of such expenses. Requires any State requesting aid under this Act to submit a plan to the Secretary for his approval indicating specified procedures and programs to be carried out under such a plan. Imposes civil penalties on persons who knowingly present false information to obtain benefits under this Act.
