Rept. 96-1219 (Part I)) Intelligence Identities Protection Act - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 by adding a new title V: Protection of Certain National Security Information. Establishes a maximum criminal penalty of ten years' imprisonment and/or a $50,000 fine for anyone who, having had authorized access to classified information, intentionally discloses to any individual not authorized to receive classified information any information that identifies a covert agent, knowing that the information so identifies such individual and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such individual's intelligence relationship to the United States. Establishes a maximum criminal penalty of five years' imprisonment and/or a $25,000 fine for anyone who, having had authorized access to classified information, learns the identity of a covert agent and intentionally discloses any information identifying such agent to any individual not authorized to receive classified information, knowing that the information so identifies such agent and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such agent's relationship to the United States. Establishes a maximum criminal penalty of three years' imprisonment and/or a $15,000 fine for anyone who with intent to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States discloses such information with such knowledge. Makes it a defense to such crimes that before the commission of the offense the United States had publicly acknowledged or revealed the intelligence relationship of the individual to the United States. Provides that no person other than the person committing such offense shall be subject to prosecution, except with respect to those acting in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents with intent to impair U.S. intelligence activities. Stipulates that: (1) proof of intentional disclosure shall not alone constitute proof of intent to impair U.S. intelligence activities; and (2) it shall not be an offense to transmit such information directly to the congressional intelligence committees. Directs the President to establish procedures to ensure that any employee of an intelligence agency or any member of the Armed Forces assigned to intelligence duties whose identity is classified information is afforded all appropriate assistance to conceal his identity."
