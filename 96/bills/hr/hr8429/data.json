    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to the State of South Dakota to develop plans for the mitigation of economic losses incurred within such State as a result of the taking of land by the United States for the Missouri River Basin project. Requires such grants to cover the cost to the State of the development of economic development plans for the State or any sector thereof. Specifies that such a grant be approved by the Secretary only after the Secretary determines that the plan is economically feasible under the terms of such Act. Limits such grants to not more than 95 percent of the cost to carry out an economic development plan and not more than 90 percent of the cost of any plan for which the State requires repayment under this Act, except that the Secretary may make available to the State and local sponsoring agencies 100 percent of the cost to carry out a plan for which the State or local sponsoring agencies agree to repay ten percent of the cost. Requires the Western Area Power Administration to make available according to the direction of the State not less than a specified number of kilowatts of electric power and to sell not less than a specified number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy at a price not to exceed the cost of production and transmission of such energy. Allows the State to establish a higher price, and any revenues collected in excess of the cost to the Western Area Power Administration shall accrue to the State. Specifies that in order to qualify for the receipt of such electric power or revenue, the State must submit to the Secretary a plan for the sharing of any such power or revenues with Indian tribes within the State and, after consulting with such Indian tribes, the Secretary shall determine that such plan provides for the equitable sharing of such power or revenues. Deauthorizes the construction, operation, and maintenance of the initial stage Oahe unit irrigation project, James division, Missouri River Basin project, South Dakota. States that those Oahe Unit works, facilities, and related properties that have been acquired or constructed shall be disposed of by the Secretary according to a plan developed by the State and approved by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations for the planning and project grants provided for by this Act. Permits the Secretary to make grants to any Indian tribe within the State for the same purposes and on the same terms as grants may be made to the State under this Act."
