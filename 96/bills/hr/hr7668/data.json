    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Foreign Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 96-1153 (Part II)) Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to define \"special activity\" to mean activity conducted abroad to further official United States programs and policies, which is planned and executed so that the role of the Government is not apparent or acknowledged publicly, but excluding diplomatic activity and the collection of intelligence or related support functions. Prohibits the expenditure of funds by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or any other Federal agency for a special activity unless the President: (1) finds that the activity is important to the national security; and (2) reports such activity, before its initiation, to the congressional intelligence committees. (Current law as provided by the Hughes-Ryan Amendment of 1974 requires such reporting to the \"appropriate\" congressional committees). Permits such reporting to be deferred for the shortest practicable period upon certification by the President that such deferral was essential to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital national interests or to avoid unreasonable risk to the safety or security of the personnel or methods employed. Stipulates that this notice does not mean prior approval of the committees is required for initiation of intelligence activity. Requires the heads of Federal entities to: (1) keep the intelligence committees fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities carried out by such entities; (2) furnish information requested by the committees; and (3) report in a timely fashion to such committees any illegal intelligence activity. Requires the President and the intelligence committees to establish procedures to carry out these requirements. Directs the House of Representatives and the Senate, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, to establish procedures to protect intelligence information from unauthorized disclosure. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act to repeal the Hughes-Ryan Amendment concerning intelligence activities in foreign countries."
