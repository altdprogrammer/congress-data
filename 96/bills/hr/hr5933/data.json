Eliminates certain disability requirements by requiring an individual's entitlement to such benefits to continue until remarriage, death, or entitlement to old- age benefits at least equal to the primary insurance amount of the deceased spouse. Continues the existing actuarial reduction until such an individual attains age 65. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to recommend legislative changes and financing methods for the amendments made by this Act."
