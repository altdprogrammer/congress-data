    "date": "1980-08-20", 
    "text": "Title I: Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1981 - Authorizes appropriations to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for fiscal year 1981, to remain available until expended, for: (1) nuclear reactor regulation; (2) inspection and enforcement; (3) standards development; (4) nuclear material safety and safeguards; (5) nuclear regulatory research; (6) program technical support; and (7) program direction and administration. Permits the Commission to use not more than one percent of the appropriations for nuclear regulatory research to involve undergraduate and graduate students in nuclear regulatory research activities. Directs that the Office of Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data be given such sums as may be necessary from the appropriations for program technical support to collect and assess data from operating reactors and to provide the Commission with a semiannual report. Requires the report to identify: (1) any condition which may pose a significantly increased risk to the public health and safety; and (2) the implication of such condition on the Commission's policies and procedures. Directs the Commission to determine the actions required with respect to any such condition. Requires at least $1,000,000 of the Commission's total appropriations be available for its activities related to the expeditious cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two. Directs the Commission to give notice to, and receive a notice of no objection from, the appropriate Congressional committees before the Commission obligates an amount $500,000 more or less than the amount authorized or appropriated for a specific purpose. Permits the Commission to retain and use cooperative nuclear research program appropriations for salaries and expenses associated with those programs. Allows the Commission to transfer to other Government agencies sums for salaries and expenses for nuclear reactor regulation from the Commission's appropriations for that purpose. Prohibits payments under this Act except to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Directs the Commission to use as much of the total appropriations authorized as is necessary to prepare and submit to Congress a line item budget request for fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Directs the Commission to use such sums as may be necessary to establish a Three Mile Island Advisory Panel to consult with and make recommendations to the Commission on matters relating to the decontamination of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. Directs the Commission to consult with the Panel concerning all decontamination activities authorized by the Commission. Directs the Commissioner to conduct a study and report to Congress recommendations for developing statistically valid data on the long term health effects of employment in the nuclear power industry. Title II: Prohibitions on the Use of Funds - Prohibits the use of any funds authorized under this Act to compensate any person intervening in any Commission proceeding for the costs of such intervention."
