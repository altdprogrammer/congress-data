Title II: Establishment of Solar Energy Development Bank - Establishes a Government corporation in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to be known as the Solar Energy Development Bank to provide subsidies of long-term low-interest loans made for the purchase and installation of solar energy systems in residential and commercial structures. Sets forth requirements for eligibility for such subsidies, and other terms and conditions thereto. Establishes a seven member advisory board to make annual reports to the Congress and the President on the operation of the program established by this Act and to advise the President of the Solar Bank and the Secretary of HUD. Permits the Solar Bank to utilize the services of HUD personnel.

Directs the Solar Bank to inform financial institutions and builders and owners of residential and commercial structures of such program and to actively seek their participation. Authorizes the Bank to train employees of such institutions in the operation of this Act. Title III: Tax Credits for Solar Energy and Woodburning Stoves - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to qualify expenditures for woodburning stoves for the 15 percent residential energy conservation tax credit.
