    "as": "Reported to House amended, Part I", 
    "date": "1980-10-08", 
    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce with amendment, H. Rept. 96-1456 (Part I)) Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Act of 1980 - Declares the findings and purposes of this Act, including: (1) to improve the identification numbering systems for motor vehicles and their major components; (2) to increase criminal penalties upon persons trafficking in stolen motor vehicles and related parts; and (3) to reduce opportunities for exporting stolen motor vehicles. =Title I: Improved Identification for Motor Vehicle Parts and Components= - Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to direct the Secretary of Transportation, within 12 months of the effective date of this Act, to publish a proposed Federal motor vehicle security standard (including results of cost-benefits studies). Directs the Secretary, after such 12 month period but within 24 months of the effective date of this Act, to promulgate such standard if he or she determines that its benefits are likely to exceed its costs. Limits to $7.50 per motor vehicle the cost that may be imposed on a motor vehicle manufacturer as a result of such standard. Authorizes a manufacturer to petition the Secretary to amend such standard for the purpose of complying with such cost requirements. Sets forth procedures for annual adjustment of such standard. Prohibits any such standard from requiring the numbering or other identification of more than 14 parts and components for any motor vehicle. Sets forth specified studies and effects to be considered by the Secretary in prescribing such standard. Directs the Secretary to submit such final standard to Congress for review according to specified procedures. Prohibits the States from establishing or continuing in effect any security standard which is not idential to such Federal standard. Directs the Secretary, within nine months of the effective date of this Act, to report to Congress concerning anti-theft security devices or systems for motor vehicles. Sets forth information to be supplied by such report. Amends the title of such Act to read \"National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety and Security Act.\" Directs that any provision of Federal law referring to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 shall be deemed a reference to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety and Security Act. Terminates all of the above provisions, unless otherwise directed at the end of June 30 of the fourth successive year following the first June 30 which occurs at least 15 months after the effective date of the security standard to be promulgated by the Secretary. =Title II: Antifencing Measures= - Establishes penalties for anyone who knowingly removes, obliterates, tampers with, or alters any identification number for any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Requires the forfeiture of any vehicle or vehicle part which has had such number removed unless: (1) the vehicle or part is owned by an innocent purchaser,; (2) the number is replaced according to applicable law; (3) the number was destroyed by collision or fire; or (4) the vehicle or part is in the possession of a scrap processor. Directs that all provisions of law relating to the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles, merchandise, and baggage shall apply to seizures and forfeitures of motor vehicles and vehicle parts. Redefines securities to include motor vehicle titles in such definition. Specifies that Federal jurisdiction will attach and remain with a motor vehicle once it has crossed a State or United States boundary line after being stolen. Establishes penalties for anyone who buys, receives, possesses, or obtains control of, with intent to sell or otherwise dispose of, any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part knowing that such identification number has been removed or altered. Amends the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 to allow prosecution under such Act of individuals and businesses which traffic in stolen vehicles and vehicle parts. Amends the Master Key Act to designate as nonmailable matter any manipulative type devise which is designed or adapted to operate, circumvent, remove, or render inoperative the ignition switch or lock, or door or trunk lock of two or more motor vehicles, or any advertisement for the sale of such device. =Title III: Importation and Exportation Measures= - Establishes criminal and civil penalties for anyone who imports, exports, or attempts to import or export any self-propelled vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or part knowing it to have been stolen, or any self-propelled vehicle or vehicle part knowing that its identification number has been altered. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require persons who export or attempt to export a used self-propelled vehicle to present to the appropriate customs officer the vehicle and a document describing that vehicle. Makes such vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or parts subject to seizure and forfeiture under this Act. =Title IV: Reporting Requirements= - Directs the Attorney General to establish a task force comprised of the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce, the Commissioner of Customs, and representatives of specified interested parties. Directs such task force to report, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to Congress on the theft of off-highway vehicles and the steps being taken to prevent such thefts and the subsequent disposition of such vehicles. Specifies information to be included in such report, including: (1) the status of the development and effectiveness of identification numbering systems for such vehicles; (2) the effectiveness of pertinent State laws; and (3) action being taken by related businesses (auctioneers, banks, insurance companies, etc.) to deter the resale of such stolen vehicles. Directs the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretaries of Transportation and the Treasury and the Postmaster General, to report to Congress on the effectiveness of this Act in preventing and reducing motor vehicle-related theft."
