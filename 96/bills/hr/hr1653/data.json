    "text": "Amends the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 to provide compensation for members of the National Commission on Unemployment Compensation who are not full-time Federal employees. Directs that: (1) the interim reports of the Commission be sent to the President, as well as to Congress, from time to time and as the Commission deems appropriate; and (2) the due date of the Commission's final report be extended one year, until July 1, 1980. Exempts the Commission from certain provisions of the Federal Reports Act which require clearance from the Office of Management and Budget for information gathering. Provides that any reports the Commission makes to Congress shall be made directly and without clearance from the Office of Management and Budget. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to delay the effective dates of provisions (1) requiring set offs against unemployment compensation of certain retirement income and (2) extending unemployment compensation coverage to certain alien agricultural workers."
