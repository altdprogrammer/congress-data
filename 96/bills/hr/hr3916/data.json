    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #571 (396-8)) Amends the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 to extend through fiscal year 1980 the current level of authorization of appropriations for assistance programs. Provides, with respect to the State plans required under such program, that the State advisory council include representatives of groups to be served with attention to assuring representation of women and the elderly, and that the survey of need set forth in a plan identify the needs of the elderly. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to give special consideration to applications for programs for the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse by the elderly (in addition to women and persons under the age of 18 years as currently provided). Stipulates that the authority of the Secretary to enter into contracts shall be effective for a fiscal year only to the extent provided in advance by appropriation Acts. Prohibits the use of funds under this Act to pay the compensation of any person who illegally uses or possesses any controlled substance. Amends the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 to extend the current level of authorizations for formula grants under such program through fiscal year 1980. Authorizes a specified amount for special project grants and contracts under such Act, for fiscal year 1980, of which at least ten percent must be obligated for primary prevention programs. Eliminates the separate authorization provision with respect to research and development by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Provides, with respect to the State plans required under such program, that the State advisory council include representatives of women and the elderly, and that the survey of need set forth in the plan identify the needs of the elderly. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to give special consideration for programs for the prevention and treatment of drug abuse by the elderly (in addition to women and persons under the age of 18 years as currently provided). Requires the Director of the National Institute to report to the appropriate congressional committees within 60 days of enactment on grants and contracts made or entered into before enactment which were not completed before April 1, 1979. Stipulates that the authority of the Secretary to enter into contracts shall be effective for a fiscal year only to the extent provided in advance by appropriation Acts."
