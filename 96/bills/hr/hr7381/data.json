    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for cash and other personal property contributions to a savings account created or organized exclusively for the purpose of paying the educational expenses of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's child. Limits the amount of such deduction to $1,000 per year, adjusted for inflation. Limits the duration of eligibility for such deduction to calendar years prior to the account beneficiary's 21st birthday, or prior to the beneficiary's enrollment as a full-time student at an eligible educational institution of higher learning, whichever occurs earlier. Excludes distributions from such an account from the gross income of the payee so long as such distributions are used to defray the beneficiary's tuition, fees, books and supplies, and reasonable living expenses. Specifies sanctions for the use of account funds for other than such educational purposes. Treats qualified distributions as income to the beneficiary for the taxable year in which the beneficiary attains age 25, and for each of the following nine years, in successive apportionments equal to ten percent of the total amount of such distributions. Allows a deduction for cash and other personal property contributions to a savings account created or organized for the benefit of the taxpayer (or the taxpayer and spouse if married) for the exclusive purpose of purchasing the first dwelling purchased by such individual as a principal residence. Limits the maximum annual deduction to $1,500 ($3,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly), with a maximum lifetime deduction of $15,000 ($30,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly). Provides for annual inflation adjustment of such amounts. Excludes distributions from such account from gross income so long as they are used exclusively for the purchase of a first principal dwelling. Provides for recapture of such distribution upon a subsequent sale of such first dwelling if another house is not purchased with the proceeds. Requires reduction of the $100,000 exclusion from gross income of proceeds from the sale of a principal residence by a taxpayer 55 years of age or older if such residence had been purchased with distributions from a tax-exempt housing savings account. Limits the amount of such reduction to the amount of any such distribution excluded from gross income."
