    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that an alien may be deported as a public charge regardless of whether such alien is legally liable to repay any public support received, or whether any demand has been made for such repayment. Authorizes the Attorney General to waive such public charge deportation if the Attorney General determines an alien has become a public charge due to a mental or physical disability which arose after such alien's entry into the United States. Prohibits the Attorney General and any consular officer from considering any document as evidence that an immigrant seeking admission into the United States is not inadmissible as a public charge unless the document: (1) provides that such immigrant's financial status will be guaranteed by a sponsor for five years; and (2) is signed by such sponsor in the presence of an immigration officer. Provides that the Attorney General or the sponsored immigrant may bring a civil suit against a sponsor who fails to make payments pursuant to a statement of sponsorship. Amends title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act to require a State plan under such program to include a quarterly report to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare containing the names and addresses of aliens applying for, or receiving, such assistance. Directs the Secretary to transmit to the Attorney General the names of such aliens, as well as those applying for, or receiving, supplemental security income. Directs the Attorney General to investigate whether such aliens are deportable as public charges."
