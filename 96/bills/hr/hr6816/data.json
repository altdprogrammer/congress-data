Describes the area in which the new leases will be issued. Provides that the leases issued shall be equal in value to the leases surrendered, but authorizes the Secretary to receive or pay a cash amount of up to 25 percent of the value of such leases in order to equalize the exchange, if they are unavoidably not of equal value. States that the new leases are to contain the same terms and conditions as the leases surrendered as of the date of the exchange."
