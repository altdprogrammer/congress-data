Establishes the Chesapeake Bay Research Board, to consist of 15 members selected by the Governors of Virginia and Maryland and by the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of specified agencies. Directs the Secretary and the Governors to ensure that the Board is comprised of qualified individuals who represent the interests of Federal, State, and local government, industry, the public, and the scientific and environmental communities. Requires the Board membership to elect the Chairman of the Board annually. Requires the Board to: (1) develop and biennially update a Chesapeake Bay Research Plan consistent with the missions and interests of appropriate agencies and States; (2) review and evaluate, periodically, Federal research programs pertaining to the Chesapeake Bay area, and ascertain the extent to which such programs are consistent with the Research Plan; and (3) submit an annual report to Congress and the Governors of Maryland and Virginia on research programs pertaining to the Chesapeake Bay area, their relationship to the Research Plan, and any recommendations for improving the coordination of such research.
