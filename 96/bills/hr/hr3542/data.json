    "text": "Perishable Food Protection Act of 1979 - Requires a union or employer to give 30 days written notice to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor of a contemplated strike or lockout affecting a processing operation engaged in interstate or foreign commerce which will cause losses of agricultural crops anywhere in the United States if permitted to occur. Allows the union, employer, or a State director of agriculture to petition the Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor to appoint an arbitrator to hear all aspects of the contract dispute. Requires all subjects of bargaining which are mandated under the National Labor Relations Act to be submitted. Sets forth procedures with respect to such arbitration hearing. Provides that the arbitrator's decision shall be final, but allows an aggrieved party to seek review in the appropriate United States court of appeals. Makes available injunctive relief in a district court to the parties or the arbitrator to enforce this Act."
