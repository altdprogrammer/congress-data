Requires the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States to receive and determine the validity and amounts of claims by U.S. nationals against Vietnam arising on or after April 29, 1975. Specifies the type of claims that may be considered. Directs the Commission to certify the amount of loss suffered by each claimant. Stipulates that the amount of any claim which has been assigned shall not exceed the amount of actual consideration paid by the last assignee. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Claims Fund for the payment of unsatisfied claims against Vietnam upon certification by the Commission. Specifies the priority of payments on such claims. Requires the Commission to complete its duties under this Act within three years. Prohibits fees in excess of ten percent of the claim. Makes specified provisions of existing law relating to the jurisdiction of the Commission, payment of claims, administrative procedure, and employee organizations applicable to the Commission."
