Requires such assessment to include specific findings and recommendations concerning the additional employment and training programs or projects needed to provide the necessary manpower, for 1980 through 1984, to fully develop and utilize all domestic energy sources. Directs the Secretary to recommend to prime sponsors programs necessary to fulfill such manpower needs for each of the five years. Prohibits the approval of any CETA plan for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1980, unless it is reasonably responsive to such recommendations."
