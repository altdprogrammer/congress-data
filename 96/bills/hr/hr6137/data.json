Rept. 96-1066) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey specified lands to the City of Angels, California. Requires the Angels city council to: (1) notify individuals and other legal entities appearing as owners of such lands of such conveyance and of possible interests in such lands arising out of the mining laws; and (2) convey such lands to applying individuals and other legal entities appearing as owners. Conditions the conveyance of such lands upon and subject to the right of mining claimants whose rights and interests were initiated pursuant to the mining laws prior to entry and patent under the Townsite Act and who initiate patent procedures and receive patents. States that remaining lands shall be held or disposed of for the benefit of the city. Extinguishes any unpatented mining claim located within such lands for which the claimant has not made application within two years unless a showing is made that a mineral survey for patent purposes cannot be completed within such period."
