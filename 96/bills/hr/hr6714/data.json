Earmarks specified funds for public information and outreach programs. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to provide assistance to low-income and elderly households to aid in meeting primary residential fuel costs. Sets forth criteria for determining the amount of such assistance, and requirements for eligibility. States that the benefits provided under such program shall not be considered income or resources for any purposes under any Federal or State law. Establishes a payment system for fuel suppliers supplying fuel to eligible recipients. Requires such suppliers to provide specified information to the appropriate State agency to qualify for such payments. States that such program shall be administered by the appropriate State agency according to an agreement between such agency and the Secretary, or, in the absence of such agreement, by the Secretary in accordance with his regulations. Requires suppliers to keep full records and submit them to the Comptroller General as needed for auditing purposes. Prohibits suppliers from refusing to sell fuel to eligible participants solely on the basis of their participation in the fuel assistance programs established under this Act. Prohibits suppliers from terminating supplies of primary residential fuel to eligible households except in accordance with specified procedures. Imposes criminal penalties for violation of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue necessary regulations. Directs the Director of the Community Services Administration to establish a crisis intervention program to supplement the fuel assistance program with evacuation procedures, emergency shelter, home repair, or payment of bills. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal years 1980 through 1982."
