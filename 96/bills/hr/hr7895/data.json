Permits an agency to make a rule effective upon promulgation for 60 days if the agency determines that any delay in implementing the rule would cause immediate and irreparable harm. Directs each agency to submit to Congress, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, an economic impact statement for each final rule which has been promulgated by such agency."
