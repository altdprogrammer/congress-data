    "text": "Title I: Short Title; Findings and Declaration of Policy; Definitions - Western Lands Distribution and Regional Equalization Act of 1980 - States that the practice of retaining Federal ownership to territory within the borders of States located west of the one-hundredth meridian as a condition precedent to their admission into the Union has impinged on the sovereignty of such States in derogation of the tenth amendment to the Constitution. Declares that the United States shall hold all federally owned, unreserved, and unappropriated lands located within such States in trust for such States and shall transfer ownership and administration of such lands to such States when they have adopted legislation which provides a uniformity of State and Federal law relating to land administration, conservation, and use. Excludes from transfer, in implementing such policy: (1) all Federal lands within national parks, national monuments, and national wildlife and migratory bird sanctuaries established prior to July 25, 1980; (2) lands within Indian or military reservations; (3) lands necessary to the operation and access to shipyards, docks, security and defense establishments and other buildings housing operations of the United States Government; and (4) lands selected pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska Statehood Act. Title II: Federal Land Transfer Board - Authorizes the Governor of any State seeking to acquire such unreserved and unappropriated lands to petition the President within 60 months of the enactment of this Act to establish a Federal Land Transfer Board for such State. Directs the President to establish such a Board consisting of State and Federal members within 90 days of the receipt of such an application. States that the Board shall serve until all conveyances of such lands within the State are carried out. Requires each Federal Land Transfer Board to coordinate its activities with the State land commission established pursuant to this Act. Directs each Board to carry out the required land transfers within two years of its determination that a State's application meets the requirements of this Act. Empowers the Land Transfer Boards to resolve land claims and disputes arising from the implementation of this Act. Grants any State aggrieved by a decision of a Land Transfer Board on its application the right to a public hearing and review before the Board. Empowers the United States courts of appeals to hear appeals from final orders of the Boards. States that judicial review shall be on the record made before the Board and that the Board's findings shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. States that the judgment of the court of appeals shall be subject to review only by the United States Supreme Court upon a writ of certiorari or certification. Title III: State Land Commissions - Requires each State seeking the conveyance of unreserved and unappropriated land under this Act, to establish a State land commission board to: (1) hold any transferred lands in trust for all people of the United States; (2) manage such lands to maximize conservation and permit compatible land uses; (3) protect the interests of persons who have acquired rights in such land under Federal law; (4) collect fees, rents, and royalties, issue licenses, conduct surveys, and perform other administrative functions relating to such lands; (5) transfer to the United States those property interests necessary to continue lawful Federal activities; and (6) continue to administer lands previously administered by the United States pursuant to a treaty or interstate compact in conformance with the terms of such treaty or compact. Requires States to make payments to local governments at least equivalent to the amount which would have been paid if such land had remained in Federal ownership. Directs each State land commission board to coordinate its activities with the appropriate Federal Land Transfer Board. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Declares that the United States shall retain control over the oceans, seas, navigable rivers, streams, and lakes, and projects of the Corps of Engineers and the Water and Power Resources Service. Directs the President to modify agreements with other nations if necessary to implement this Act. Grants the consent of Congress to any interstate compact relating to the management and use of lands if it has been approved by the appropriate Federal Land Transfer Boards. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
