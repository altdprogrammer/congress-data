Directs the Secretary: (1) to undertake an immediate study of the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry incentives program; (2) to submit findings and recommendations to the appropriate committees of Congress by December 1, 1981; and (3) to consult with representatives of various specified interests in the course of such study and identify their views in forwarding findings and recommendations to Congress. Allows a specified limited amount of the appropriations for this Act to be utilized for such study."
