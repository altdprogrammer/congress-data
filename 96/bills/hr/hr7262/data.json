    "date": "1980-08-22", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #480 (291-43)) Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 - =Title I: Community and Neighborhood Development and Conservation= - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to specify for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983 that no data derived from the 1980 Decennial Census, except those relating to population and poverty, shall be taken into account for purposes of the allocation of funds to metropolitan areas. Prohibits, for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, any revision to the criteria for establishing a metropolitan area or defining a central city of such an area published after January 1, 1980, to be taken into account for purposes of this title, except in the case of any area or city which would newly qualify as a metropolitan area or a central city of such an area. Specifies that, with respect to grants for State, tribal, and local community development programs, beginning in fiscal year 1981, the population of any unit of general local government which is included in that of an urban county shall be included in the population of such urban county for three program years beginning with the program year in which its population was first so included. Requires any county seeking qualification as an urban county, including any urban county seeking to continue such qualification, to notify each unit of general local government, which is included therein and is eligible to elect to have its population excluded from that of an urban county, of its opportunity to make such an election. Declares that the Congress finds that the Nation's cities, towns, and smaller urban communities face critical social, economic, and environmental problems arising in significant measure from increasing energy costs which have seriously undermined the quality and overall effectiveness of local community and housing development activities. States that concerted action is required of Federal, State, and local governments to address the economic and social hardships borne by communities as a consequence of scarce fuel supplies. Allows grants for State and local community development programs to be available for the conservation of the Nation's scarce energy resources, improvement of energy efficiency, and the provision of alternative and renewable energy sources of supply. Allows the applicant, at the discretion of the applicant, when applying for such grants, to include as part of the program summary, formulation, and description required by such Act, comparable information with respect to the applicant's energy conservation and renewable energy resource needs and objectives. Makes activities necessary to the development of a comprehensive community-wide energy use strategy eligible for assistance under the community development program. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for the purpose of making grants to States and units of local government to help finance community development programs for fiscal years 1981 through 1983. Authorizes funds for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 for the purpose of assisting severely distressed cities that require supplemental grant assistance in order to alleviate excessive deterioration through neighborhood reclamation and community revitalization. Limits amounts of appropriated funds which may be used to aid metropolitan cities, urban counties, and other units of local government within metropolitan areas to meet their basic grant needs. Eliminates hold-harmless entitlements. Declares that funds which are to be reallocated, after a determination by the Secretary that they are not likely to be fully obligated during a community development program period, shall be reallocated first to other units of general local government in the metropolitan area to which the funds were originally allocated, second, in any metropolitan area in the same State, and third, in any other metropolitan area. Requires an applicant for a grant under the community development program to take into account the effect of such activities on the involuntary displacement of low- and moderate-income persons and appropriate environmental factors. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to continue the study on involuntary displacement conducted under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 and to transmit, not later than March 30, 1981, a report to Congress which shall contain: (1) data collected since the initial report; and (2) further recommendations on minimizing involuntary displacement and alleviating problems caused by such displacement. Amends the Housing Act of 1964 to define the terms \"congregate housing\" and \"single-room occupancy housing\" as residential property in which some or all of the dwelling units do not contain kitchen or bathroom facilities. Extends the rehabilitation loan program under such Act to include congregate housing and single-room occupancy housing, and to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 for community and neighborhood development and conservation programs. Authorizes appropriations, through fiscal year 1982, for the neighborhood self-help development programs under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to reimburse the Veterans Administration for properties transferred to urban homesteading programs. Requires the Secretary, not later than January 1, 1983, to report to the Congress with respect to the adequacy, effectiveness, and equity of the formula used for the allocation of funds for community development programs under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, with specific analysis and recommendations concerning the manner in which such formula is or could be affected by the date derived from the 1980 decennial census. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require an applicant for an urban development action grant to identify all properties which are included or are eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and would be affected by such project to the appropriate State historic preservation officer and the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary, after consulting with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to prescribe and implement regulations concerning such projects. Directs the Secretary of the Interior in prescribing and implementing such regulations to provide that: (1) the appropriate State historic preservation officer, within 45 days after receiving information from the applicant, submits comments, together with such other information considered necessary to the applicant concerning such properties; and (2) the Secretary, not later than 45 days after receiving such application and the comments submitted to the applicant by the State historic preservation officer, shall make a determination as to whether any of the properties affected by such project is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to allow certain grantees under the community development block grant program which are not undertaking a comprehensive community development program to file performance reports less frequently than annually. Includes certain independent cities in computing the amounts of community development grants for urban counties. =Title II: Housing Assistance Programs= - Authorizes additional authority for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into contracts for annual contributions under the United States Housing Act of 1937, after October 1, 1980, for low-income housing projects. Directs the Secretary to enter into only such new contracts for preliminary loans as are consistent with the number of dwelling units for which contracts for annual contributions may be entered into. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to provide assistance to improve the physical condition of existing public housing projects, and to upgrade the management and operation of such projects, in order to assure that such projects continue to be available to serve low-income families. Allows the Secretary to make available and contract to make available financial assistance to public housing agencies for the purpose of improving the physical condition of existing low-rent public housing projects and for upgrading the management and operation of such projects to the extent necessary to maintain such physical improvements. Prohibits such assistance from being made, except in the case of a public housing agency which meets such criteria of financial distress as are established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary has approved an application from the public housing agency which has been developed in consultation with appropriate local officials and with tenants of such housing projects. Sets forth the information required in such application. Specifies that, in the case of a public housing agency which meets the financial distress criteria, not more than five percent of the total amount of assistance made available to all public housing agencies in any year shall be made available for such purposes. Declares that in making such assistance the Secretary shall give preference to public housing agencies which: (1) request assistance for projects having conditions which threaten the health or safety of the tenants or have a significant number of vacant, substandard units; and (2) have demonstrated a capability of carrying out the activities proposed in the plan submitted and approved by the Secretary. Provides for assistance to any public housing agency in an amount which the Secretary determines is necessary to meet emergency or special purpose needs. Allows the Secretary to make, and contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a multifamily rental project in order to encourage the construction of new or substantially rehabilitated multifamily rental housing projects designed for families with incomes which do not exceed 150 percent of the median income of the area in which the project is located. Permits such payments to be made for a period of not more than 30 years to mortgages holding mortgages secured by such a project. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures for review of incomes of tenants at intervals of two years. Requires the Secretary, if as a result of such review it is determined that there are tenants in the project whose incomes exceed 150 percent of the median income for the area, to provide that rental payments made by each such tenant shall increase over a three-year period so that at the end of such period each such tenant will be paying the amount of rent which would be charged with respect to the tenant's dwelling unit if payments were not made with respect to the project. Reduces the amounts payable by the Secretary with respect to the project by any amount received by the owner as a result of such increased rental payments. Directs the Secretary, in making such rental assistance, to give a preference to projects which have or will receive financial contributions for a State or local government. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to prohibit multifamily housing initiative program assistance from being available if the unit of general local government, with jurisdiction over the area in which the project is to be located, has any law, ordinance or other measure which would control rents on projects built after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for operating assistance for troubled multifamily housing projects under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. Amends the National Housing Act to direct the Secretary to utilize amounts credited to the rental housing assistance fund for the sole purpose of carrying out assistance for trouble multifamily housing projects through September 30, 1981. Increases the allowable maximum amount for mortgage assistance payments under the National Housing Act. Amends the National Housing Act to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, upon disposition or nonoccupancy by the homeowner of any property receiving a mortgage assistance payment, except any property with respect to which there is an assumption in accordance with such Act, to provide for the recapture of any amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the amount of assistance actually received; or (2) an amount equal to at least 50 percent of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. Allows the Secretary, under the mortgage insurance program, to insure a mortgage involving a principal obligation which exceeds, by not more than ten percent, the maximum limits, if such mortgage relates to a dwelling to be occupied by a physically handicapped person. Allows the Secretary, in order to prevent inflationary conditions and related governmental actions from having a severely disproportionate effect on the housing industry, to make and contract to make periodic assistance payments to mortgagees or other lenders on behalf of homeowners (including the owners of mobile homes). States that not more than 75 percent of such authority may be so utilized. Terminates such authority on September 30, 1981, or at such earlier date as the Secretary may deem appropriate. Sets forth the eligibility requirements for such assistance payments. Specifies that assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a homeowner shall be made only during such time as the homeowner shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage or loan. Permits the Secretary to insure, upon application by the mortgagee, a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who meets the eligibility requirements for assistance payments.
