Stipulates that such prohibition shall apply with respect to any proceeding commenced under the Bankruptcy Act during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending October 1, 1979. Subjects educational loans made, insured, or guaranteed in whole or in part by a governmental unit or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a government unit, or nonprofit institution of higher education to such prohibition.
