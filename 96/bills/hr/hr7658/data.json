Requires such study to take into consideration estimated demand for each proposed rail rapid transit line extension, projected population growth along each proposed extension, and the engineering feasibility of each proposed extension. Requires the Transit Authority to submit to the Secretary and the Congress, a report, within six months after the date of contract is entered into, on that part of the study on the feasibility of extending a rail rapid transit line to the Dulles International Airport, and a report, within 18 months after the date the contract is entered into, on the entire study, containing proposed routes for each proposed rail rapid transit line extension. Requires such contract to provide for a Federal contribution, not to exceed 80 percent and to be paid by the Secretary to the Transit Authority, to pay for the costs of the contract."
