Waives such restriction if the head of the department obligating such funds determines that: (1) such restriction is not consistent with the public interest; (2) adequate domestic goods are not available; or (3) such restriction will increase project costs more than ten percent. Prohibits the obligation of over $10,000 in Federal funds for building construction or repair work unless the department head determines that the work will be performed by citizens or resident aliens of the United States. Declares that such prohibition shall not apply if: (1) there are not sufficient qualified citizens or aliens to perform such work; or (2) it would increase project costs by over ten percent."
