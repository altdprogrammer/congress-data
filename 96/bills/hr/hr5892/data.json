    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-1217) Wind Energy Systems Act of 1980 - Makes findings that wind energy can potentially contribute 1.7 quads of energy per year by the year 2000. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to establish an eight year research, development, demonstration and technology applications program for converting wind energy into electricity and mechanical energy. Declares further that it is the policy of the United States to: (1) make the cost of electricity produced by wind systems competitive with the cost of electricity produced from conventional sources by 1988; (2) reach a total megawatt capacity from wind energy systems, by the end of fiscal year 1988, of at least 800 megawatts, of which at least 100 megawatts will be provided by small wind energy systems; and (3) accelerate the growth of a commercially viable and competitive industry industry to make wind energy systems available to the general public. Defines the terms: (1) \"small wind energy system\" to mean a wind energy system having a maximum rated capacity of one hundred kilowatts or less; and (2) \"known wind resource\" to mean a site with an estimated average annual wind velocity of at least twelve miles per hour. Directs the Secretary to prepare and transmit to Congress a comprehensive program management plan which shall include: (1) a five-year program for small wind energy systems; (2) an eight-year program for large wind energy systems; and (3) a three-year program for wind resource assessment. Directs the Secretary to annually transmit to Congress a detailed description of the plan as then in effect. Directs the Secretary to initiate research and development or accelerate existing research and development in areas in which the lack of knowledge limits the widespread utilization of wind energy systems. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements for the purchase, fabrication, installation, and testing of prototype advanced wind energy systems. Directs the Secretary to establish a technology application program for wind energy systems to reduce the cost of wind energy systems through mass production and by determining operating and maintenance costs through broad operational systems experience. Authorizes various forms of Federal assistance to carry out such program including: (1) contracts and cooperative agreements; (2) grants; (3) loans; and (4) direct Federal procurement. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts for the production and utilization of large and small energy systems in order to establish the technology application program. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to provide for loans of up to 75 percent of the total purchase and installation costs of wind energy systems providing in the aggregate up to 320 megawatts peak generating capacity involving a minimum of four projects. Limits any such loan in any year to no more than 50 percent of the amount appropriated under this Act for such year. Directs the Secretary to initiate a three-year national wind resource assessment program. Directs the Secretary, as part of such program, to: (1) validate existing assessments of known wind resources; (2) initiate a site prospecting program; (3) establish standard wind date collection and siting techniques; and (4) establish a national wind data center. Establishes as priorities for program selection: (1) minimizing costs of constructing, operating, and maintaining wind energy systems; (2) making wind power costs competitive; (3) giving priority to programs in which cost-sharing funds are provided; and (4) giving priority, but not exclusive emphasis, in the early years of the programs under this Act to research and development activities and wind resource assessment and in later years to technology application programs. Directs the Secretary, in coordination with appropriate Government agencies, to: (1) monitor the performance and operation of wind energy systems; (2) collect and evaluate date on the performance and operation of wind energy systems installed under this Act; and (3) from time to time carry out such studies and investigations as necessary to assure that the programs under the Act are effectively carried out. Directs the Secretary to utilize to the maximum extent practicable the technological and management capabilities, equipment, and facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in carrying out this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine the potential for the use of wind systems at specific Federal facilities; (2) study the effects of wind energy systems on existing electrical utility systems; (3) determine the necessity for additional incentives to either users or manufacturers of wind energy technologies; (4) evaluate the performance of wind energy systems in various applications; and (5) study the prospects for wind energy systems in foreign countries, particularly lesser developed countries. Directs the Secretary to take steps to assure that small businesses will have realistic and adequate opportunities to participate in programs under this Act. States that the Secretary is not prevented from undertaking projects or activities in addition to those specified in this Act if such projects or activities further the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. Requires that in each of the five years of the small wind energy systems program, at least 25 percent of the total authorization for appropriations shall be for small wind energy systems."
