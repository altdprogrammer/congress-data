Extends to church employees the same option presently enjoyed by employees of tax-exempt health and education organizations to elect alternative exclusion allowances for contributions to annuity contracts. Provides a minimum $10,000 allowance for annual additions to these contracts without regard to the amount of the employee's compensation."
