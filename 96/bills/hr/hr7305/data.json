    "text": "Amends the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1980 and 1981, to increase the authorization of appropriation to the State Department for fiscal year 1980 and 1981 for international organizations and conferences and for fiscal year 1981 for the administration of foreign affairs (earmarks a specified portion for payment ex gratia to Yugoslavia for injuries sustained by a Yugoslav national). Decreases the authorization of appropriations for international commissions. Repeals the ceilings on the aggregate amount spent on the administration of foreign affairs, international organizations and conferences, and international commissions. Amends the Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 to increase the authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 for the Board for International Broadcasting. Amends specified passport provisions to provide for the Secretary of State to prescribe a fee for issued passports which shall be paid into the U.S. Treasury (presently such fees are set at ten dollars for each passport and are paid quarterly). Extends the period of validity of a passport from five years to ten years. Removes the ceiling on authorized funds for the U.S. share of expenses of the Pan American Institute of Geography and History. Prohibits the U.S. payment of its share of the annual expenses of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and of the International (Rome) Institute for the Unification of Private Law from exceeding ten percent of the total expenses after 1978 (currently seven percent). Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to direct the President to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a U.S. representative to the Vienna office of the United Nations. Authorizes the use of appropriated funds for living quarters for the staffs of U.S. representatives to the United Nations. Authorizes necessary appropriations for the U.S. share of the expenses of the United Nations peacekeeping forces (presently limited to those in the Middle East). Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for the Inter-American Foundation. Exempts private sector representatives on U.S. delegations to international telecommunications conferences, who are specifically designated as the U.S. Representative with respect to a particular matter, from specified criminal code provisions on conflicts of interest. Requires such representatives to have on file a financial disclosure report with the State Department. Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to permit any person having special scientific, technical, or professional qualifications, in the employ or service of the U.S. Government, to be assigned to a foreign government (presently restricted to U.S. citizens). Authorizes the making of procurement contracts for periods which do not exceed five years if: (1) appropriations are adequate for the first fiscal year; (2) Government need is reasonably firm and continuing; (3) such contract will encourage effective competition or promote economics in performance and operation; and (4) such method will not inhibit small business participation. Requires such contracts to be cancelled if funds are not available for continuation into subsequent fiscal years. Revises the authority of the Director of the International Communication Agency (ICA) to purchase vehicles for use abroad to permit security vehicles to be purchased without regard to maximum price limitations. Provides for the principal assistant of an ICA Associate Director to perform the duties of any Associate Director who dies, resigns, or is sick or absent. Requires the ICA Director to make available the film, \"Reflection: Samuel Eliott Morison,\" for public distribution within the United States."
