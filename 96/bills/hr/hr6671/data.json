    "text": "(Senate receded from certain amendment) Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 - Establishes navigational rules applicable to all vessels upon the inland waters of the United States, including vessels of the United States on the Candian waters of the Great Lakes to the extent that there is no conflict with Canadian law. Specifies that this Act shall not interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Secretary of the Navy with respect to specified station or signal lights. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to determine whether a vessel complies with this Act regarding the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes as well as the characteristics of sound- signaling appliances. Directs the Secretary of the Navy to determine such compliance for vessels of the Navy. Allows the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to accept a certificate of alternative compliance issued by a contracting party to the International Regulations. Makes any vessel or the owner, master, or crew thereof, responsible for failure to comply with this Act or for failure to take any precautions which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the circumstances of the case. Sets forth comprehensive rules governing the steering, speed, and sailing of vessels, lights affixed to vessels, and sound and light signals required aboard vessels. Exempts certain vessels from specified provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish certain technical annexes to this Act. Makes violators of this Act liable for civil penalties in district court, to be assessed by the Secretary. Empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold or revoke the clearance of any vessel, the owner or operator of which is subject to the penalties of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establish, for five years, a Rules of the Road Advisory Council. Requires such Council to make recommendations relating to this Act to the Secretary. Amends the International Navigational Rules Act of 1977 to exempt vessels which are in inland waters of the United States. Repeals certain Federal law concerning inland navigation."
