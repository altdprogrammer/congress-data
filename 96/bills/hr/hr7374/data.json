Provides that if a couple exercises such option and one spouse is not fully insured, that spouse shall become fully insured by reason of crediting wages and self-employment income to that spouse. Grants a couple, after a divorce, two years within which to exercise the option. Provides that, if a couple chooses not to exercise the option, their benefit will be based on 75 percent of the combined primary insurance amount."
