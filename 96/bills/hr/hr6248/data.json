Prohibits such refiners or distributors from engaging in any act of economic reprisal against such franchisees because of their sale, consignment, or distribution of gasohol or any activities related thereto which are not covered by the franchise termination and nonrenewal provisions of such Act. States that the sale, consignment, or distribution of gasohol or any activities directly related thereto shall not be grounds for terminations or nonrenewal of such franchises. Makes technical amendments to such Act incorporating the provisions of this Act."
