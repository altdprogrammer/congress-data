Makes the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy Chairman of the Council. Directs the Chairman of the Council to give notice of the initial hearing to obtain information relevant to such question to all persons participating in such adjudication. Authorizes the Chairman to establish advisory hearing panels to hold such hearing. Permits those persons participating in the adjudication to present relevant oral and written information.

Sets forth the requirements for reports on questions involving an evaluation of the risk of harm to human health presented by a substance, including a summary of effects observed, the quality of the information presented, and an advisory opinion of such panel. Sets forth Council procedures for final decisions with respect to any question of scientific fact referred to an advisory panel. Requires the agency presiding over the adjudication from which the question is referred to attempt to narrow and resolve such question by stipulations. Requires the Council to respond to the agency within 90 days after a question is referred. Sets forth the requirements of such a response, including written specific findings and hearing transcripts.

Requires all agencies to provide the Council with whatever information it may require. Sets forth the composition of and manner of appointment to the Council. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to refer to the National Science Council, upon the request of any interested person, any question of scientific fact which involves the harm any chemical in or on any consumer product may cause to human health and which is relevant to determining whether such consumer product presents a substantial product hazard. Makes the final decision of the Council the final decision of the Commission with respect to such question.
