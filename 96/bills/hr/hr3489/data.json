Requires that: (1) the first 33,700 acre-feet of water from storage in the enlarged Bumping Lake be used for irrigation pursuant to existing water rights; (2) 75 percent of any additional water from storage in the enlarged Bumping Lake be used for maintenance and enhancement of anadromous and resident fish resources in the Yakima River System; and (3) 25 percent of any additional water be used for irrigation, in integrating and coordinating the operations of the enlarged Bumping Lake into other features of the Yakima project, to effect the fullest, most beneficial and most economic utilization of the available water resources. Directs the Secretary, prior to initiation of project construction,to: (1) secure the necessary permits from the State of Washington for water storage in and operation of an enlarged Bumping Lake; and (2) regulate releases from new storage to carry out the purposes of this Act through agreement with the State of Washington. Directs the Secretary to prepare a detailed fish and wildlife compensation plan in coordination with the United States Forest Service and with appropriate agencies of the State of Washington. Requires that irrigation repayment contracts shall provide for repayment within 50 years. Sets forth the formula to be used in determining the interest to be paid by non-Federal entities."
