    "text": "Biological Organisms Act of 1980 - Prohibits any person from moving any biological organism into or within the United States without the authorization of the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe the conditions and procedures for the movement of such organisms. Prohibits any movement of organisms which would involve a danger of the dissemination of such organisms as may be hazardous to American agriculture or the production of food or fiber. Authorizes inspectors to: (1) stop and inspect without a warrant any person or means of conveyance moving into or within the United States to determine whether any biological organism is being moved; and (2) enter premises with a warrant to make inspections and seizures necessary to enforce the provisions of this Act. Permits the Secretary to compromise, modify, or remit any civil penalty assessed under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue subpoenas. Establishes criminal penalties for the unauthorized movement of biological organisms. Vests the U.S. district courts with jurisdiction in all cases arising under this Act. Empowers the Secretary to seize or quarantine any organisms or premises as an emergency measure. Permits the Secretary to require the owner of such organisms or premises to apply remedial measures to such organisms or premises or to dispose of such organisms in an appropriate manner. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with any Federal or State agency to enforce this Act and to eradicate, control or prevent the spread of any biological organism harmful to agriculture."
