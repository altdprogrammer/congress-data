Requires the Commission to certify: (1) the amount of damages to the individual claimants and to the Secretary of State; and (2) the amount of each award to the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a special fund for the payment of such awards into which shall be paid: (1) payments by Iran to satisfy such claims; and (2) amounts realized from Iranian assets subject to control under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Requires the Secretary to make payments from such funds for awards not otherwise satisfied by Iran. Directs the President to continue to prohibit transactions in at least $100,000,000 of Iranian assets subjected to controls, until all claims are fully satisfied."
