Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe the components and quantities of such ration, and to periodically review it to reflect changes in food service technology, nutritional knowledge and requirements, and food preference of the enlistees. Provides for: (1) ration adjustments; and (2) ration sales to enlisted members, officers, and civilians. Repeals provisions concerning: (1) Presidential authority for prescribing Army and Air Force rations; (2) commissioned officers in the field buying rations; (3) disposition of a deceased's member's personal effects; (4) money for commuted rations; and (5) flight rations."
