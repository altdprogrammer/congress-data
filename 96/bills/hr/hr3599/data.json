    "text": "Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1979 - Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to cooperate with State and local officials in the development of transportation plans and programs which are formulated on the basis of transportation needs with due consideration to comprehensive long-range land use plans, overall social, economic, environmental, and system performance, and with due consideration to their probable effect on the future development of the area. Stipulates that such planning shall include an analysis of alternative transportation system management and investment strategies to make more efficient use of existing transportation facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public agencies for airport system planning and airport master planning to carry out such policies. Stipulates that the total sum of such grants shall not exceed $250,000,000 and that the amount obligated in any single fiscal year may not exceed $25,000,000. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop jointly procedures designed to prevent duplication of their respective planning assistance activities and to insure that such activities are effectively coordinated. Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from approving any project application for a project involving airport location, a major runway extension, or runway location unless the Secretary finds that it is consistent with any water quality management plans certified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and any State Implementation Plan approved by the Administrator under the Clean Air Act."
