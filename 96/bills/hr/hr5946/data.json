Prohibits any foreign nation, and the owners or operators of its fishing vessels, from fishing within such area. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to take any necessary action to ensure that at least one United States observer is aboard each foreign fishing vessel during the time such vessel is within the conservation zone. Requires such foreign vessel to display an insignia, in such form and manner as established by the Secretary, to indicate the presence of such observer. Requires observers to collect such scientific data, and perform such management and enforcement activities as are deemed necessary by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to allow observer assistants, representing various segments of the United States fishing industry, to accompany and assist United States observers in carrying out their duties. Specifies that such assistants are not to be considered employees or officers of the United States for any purpose. Directs the Secretary to provide necessary training to observers and observer assistants, and the Coast Guard to provide transportation to and from foreign vessels for such individuals. Provides that the United States be reimbursed for the cost of such observers and observer assistants on board any foreign vessel by the appropriate foreign nation."
