    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require an electric utility licensed under the Act to obtain insurance to cover excess energy costs incurred when substitute electric energy is sold to consumers to replace nuclear energy which is unavailable to such utility because of a nuclear incident resulting in the shutdown of a commercial nuclear powerplant owned or operated by such utility. Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to require each licensed electric utility to participate in an industry retrospective rating plan. Sets forth the terms of such plan. Directs the Commission to enter into an agreement with each electric utility required to have insurance to pay to such utility the amount by which the excess energy costs associated with a nuclear incident exceed the insurance coverage of such utility. Requires an electric utility which suspends or terminates nuclear energy generation following a nuclear incident to calculate for each billing period its excess energy costs. Prohibits electric utilities which sell electric energy to consumers from receiving from such consumers any portion of the excess energy costs of providing substitute electric energy."
