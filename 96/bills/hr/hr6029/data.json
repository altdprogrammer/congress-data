Establishes criminal penalties for violating such regulations. Requires the President to submit to Congress semiannual reports on the Agreement. Requires the President to exercise the powers and duties conferred by this Act to protect the interests of U.S. consumers. Directs the President to request the International Sugar Council or the Executive Committee to increase supplies of sugar available to world markets if there has been an unwarranted increase in the price of sugar as a result of the Agreement or market manipulation by members of the International Sugar Organization. Directs the President to seek congressional action if the Council fails to take corrective action after such request. Suspends the authority to implement the Agreement until market manipulation activities have ceased after being requested to do so."
