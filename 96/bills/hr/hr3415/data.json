    "text": "Civilian Nuclear Reactor Emergency Act of 1979 - Title I: Nuclear Emergencies - Establishes a Presidential Commission to be called the Nuclear Reactor Emergency Commission. Directs the Commission to develop comprehensive specifications of conditions which an existing or potential malfunction of a civilian reactor would lead to substantial short- or long-term dangers to the health of the general public, or to substantial contamination of the general environment. Stipulates that all operating licenses granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) shall include provisions for the operation of such nuclear reactors in the event of a nuclear reactor emergency as defined by the Commission. Title II: Notification of Public Authorities - Requires operators of any nuclear reactor subject to licensing by the NRC to notify the NRC of the occurrence of any nuclear reactor emergency at a nuclear reactor for which they are the operators. Title III: Emergency Operation and Supervision of Nuclear Reactors - Authorizes and directs the NRC to assume direct responsibility for the operation of a nuclear reactor in the event that the NRC is informed or determines that a nuclear reactor emergency exists. Title IV: Emergency Plans - Directs the Nuclear Reactor Emergency Commission to prepare an analysis of all nuclear accident and malfunctions which have occurred at civilian nuclear reactors. Requires the Commission, based on such analysis, to submit proposals to Congress, and prepare model emergency plans for use by State and local authorities. Title V: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary to carry out the duties of the Nuclear Reactor Emergency Commission. Title VI: Expiration of Authority of the Nuclear Reactor Emergency Commission - Terminates the authority of the Nuclear Reactor Emergency Commission under this Act two years from the date of enactment of this Act. Title VII: Conforming Provisions - Stipulates that this Act supercedes all existing provisions of law."
