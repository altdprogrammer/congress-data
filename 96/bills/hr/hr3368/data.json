    "text": "Nitrite Substitute Research Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct or arrange for the conduct of: (1) further research on the effects of nitrites on animals other than the Sprague-Dawley species of rat; and (2) research on possible nitrite substitutes, and preservative methods and processes, or combinations thereof, that may be used in the preservation of meat, poultry, or fish. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress, one year after enactment, about the actions he has taken to develop an acceptable nitrite substitute. Directs the Secretary to petition the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for the issuance of a regulation prescribing conditions for the safe use of any such nitrite substitute. Authorizes the Secretary to reallocate funds appropriated for the Department of Agriculture for other agricultural research programs to conduct the research required by this Act. Requires the Secretary, within 30 days after enactment, to report to Congress on the funds he plans to commit to nitrite substitute research, on the sources of such funds, and any recommendations about the funding necessary to fully effect such research. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from taking any action under the Wholesome Meat Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or any other law to prohibit the sale, distribution, or use of nitrites as a food preservative solely on the basis of any carcinogenic effect in humans that nitrites may be represented to have, unless validated evidence is made available to the Secretaries which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that nitrites as a food preservative have a significant carcinogenic effect on humans."
