Sets forth elements to be included in such program, including: (1) development of a commercial export market; (2) systems that will serve the needs of international development programs; (3) small-scale solar photovoltaic energy systems for use by nongovernmental organizations; (4) bilateral and multilateral agreements to support solar photovoltaic energy system demonstration projects; (5) development of systems intended specifically for application in foreign countries; (6) marketing assistance for domestic manufacturers; and (7) foreign education and training programs. Directs the Secretary to promote international participation in the development of such program. Permits the use of funds for solar photovoltaics in a hybrid system with other renewable energy sources. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish assistance for activities which facilitate the commercialization of solar photovoltaic energy technologies in foreign countries and which supplement existing programs. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees regarding financial assistance in excess of $2,000,000. Directs the Secretary to subsidize any import fees imposed in connection with any demonstration project. Requires the Secretary to fully disseminate information concerning activities conducted under this Act. Sets forth criteria for the selection of programs. Directs the Secretary to coordinate activities with scientific and technical representatives and other Federal agencies. Requires the Secretary to assure that small businesses have the opportunity to participate in the solar photovoltaic program by reserving ten percent of the authorized funds for contracts with small businesses. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on activities undertaken pursuant to this Act. Title II: International Solar Photovoltaic Energy Advisory Committee - Establishes an International Solar Photovoltaic Energy Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on research and development of solar photovoltaic energy systems."
