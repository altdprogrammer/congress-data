    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to waive the requirement that an alien graduate of a foreign medical school must pass the National Board of Medical Examiners examination for admission as an immigrant or nonimmigrant exchange visitor if such alien was permanently licensed to practice medicine in a State, and was practicing on January 9, 1977. Provides that such an alien's stay shall be for the time typically required to complete the designated course of medical study (presently two years with a one year extension). Makes such provision applicable to aliens entering the United States as exchange visitors on or after January 10, 1978. Permits such an alien to change his/her designated course of medical study upon approval of the Director of the International Communication Agency once within two years after entry or acquisition of exchange visitor status (presently must continue course of education under which admitted to the United States). Extends the waiver authority regarding such aliens from December 31, 1980, to December 31, 1982 (with a discretionary one year extension for programs which have substantially reduced their reliance on such aliens). Directs that the Secretary of Health and Human Services make a case-by-case determination regarding such waiver. Adds the additional requirement before such waiver may be authorized that the medical program concerned have an approved plan to reduce its reliance on alien physicians, including descriptions of: (1) problems anticipated without such waiver and alternative methods to reduce any health services disruption; (2) changes in the program and recruiting efforts to attract U.S. citizens; and (3) how the program, on a yearly basis, has phased down its dependence on such aliens. Directs the Secretary, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to: (1) monitor the issuance of such waivers and programs; and (2) report to the Congress at the start of each fiscal year beginning in 1981 on the nationality, specialization, and geographic distribution of such aliens receiving waivers. Requires the Secretary, after consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the International Communications Agency, to evaluate the effectiveness to foreign nations and to the United States of such medical training programs, and to report to the Congress within two years of enactment of this Act regarding such evaluation. Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) deem as a health manpower shortage area any public or private nonprofit hospital with an accredited residency program for which such a waiver has been authorized; (2) assign National Health Service Corps personnel to such hospital residency programs with the aim of reducing the number of enrolled aliens; and (3) reduce certain payments owed by the hospital to the United States for the services of Corps personnel in positions formerly filled by such aliens. States that a Corps member serving in such a residency program shall have such time counted toward satisfying his/her period of obligated service."
