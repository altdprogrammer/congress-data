Makes funds authorized for 1981 available for: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (3) United States Antarctic Program; (4) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (5) Ocean Drilling Programs; (6) Science Education Programs; (7) engineering and applied science; (8) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (9) Cross-Directorate Programs; and (10) program development and management. Establishes minimum amounts to be spent for specified programs, including Earthquake Hazards Mitigation, the Small Business Innovation Program, Research and Development in Appropriate Technology, Science Facility Improvement Programs, Science Education Programs relating to Appropriate Technology, and for salaries of faculty members at institutions of higher education with limited programs in science and engineering. Establishes spending ceilings for specified programs, including the Ocean Margin Drilling Project and United States/Union of Soviet Socialist Republics cooperative research. Requires the Foundation to prepare and submit to Congress a report on the Ocean Margin Drilling Project. Requires the National Academy of Sciences to study and report on marine earth sciences research. Limits the amount which may be used for official consultation or representation at the discretion of the Director of the National Science Foundation and for the expenses of the National Science Foundation incurred outside the United States. Permits the transfer of funds from one category to another as specified. Requires the foundation to consolidate all Directors. Requires the Director of the Foundation, with the Secretary of Education, to develop and transmit to Congress a proposed joint science education program plan. Eliminates the Civil Service Commission clearance of personnel with access to specified information or property requirement. Makes individuals who make outstanding contributions in the behavioral or social sciences eligible to receive a National Medal of Science. Directs the President to develop and report to Congress a comprehensive national policy respecting women and minorities in science and technology. Requires the Director to require that all Foundation grants contain a brief statement of the purpose of the research being undertaken."
