    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) National Aquaculture Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretaries of Commerce, the Interior, and Agriculture, after consultation with certain Federal and State officials, Regional Fishery Management Councils, and representatives of the aquaculture industry, to establish a National Aquaculture Development Plan. Permits the Secretaries to create an advisory committee to assist in the development of such plan. Requires that such plan: (1) identify aquatic species that have potential for culturing on a commercial or other basis; (2) recommend actions to achieve that potential; (3) include research programs on the effects of aquaculture on water areas; and (4) specify which Secretaries are responsible for certain actions to implement the plan. Directs the Secretaries to: (1) review the plan periodically and revise it as necessary; and (2) undertake a continuing assessment of aquaculture in the United States. Requires the Secretaries to: (1) provide assistance with respect to aquaculture to interested persons; (2) encourage the implementation of aquaculture technology in the rehabilitation of fish stocks; (3) establish an information service on aquaculture; (4) collect and protect confidential information on public and private acquaculture activities; (5) determine whether existing capture fisheries could be adversely affected by competition from commercial aquaculture enterprises; and (6) report to Congress, biennially, on the status of aquaculture in the United States. Establishes within the Office of Science and Technology Policy an interagency aquaculture coordinating group to operate as a Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology. Directs the group to assess national needs for aquaculture research and assistance, coordinate aquaculture programs of Federal agencies, and recommend actions on aquaculture issues to the Federal Council. Authorizes the Secretaries to carry out their functions under the Plan through grants or contracts. Limits the amount of any grant to one-half of the estimated cost of the associated project. Directs the Secretaries: (1) through the coordinating group, to conduct and submit to Congress studies on the capital requirements of and State and Federal regulatory constraints on the U.S. aquaculture industry; and (2) to formulate and submit to Congress plans recommending Federal actions and legislation necessary to meet such requirements and to remove unnecessarily burdensome regulatory constraints. Authorizes appropriations for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and the Interior for fiscal years 1981 through 1983 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
