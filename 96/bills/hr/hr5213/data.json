    "text": "Amends title II (Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to permit an individual to use the monthly (instead of annual) earnings test during the first year, after 1977, of the individual's entitlement to OASDI benefits. Disregards certain royalties and income received on a deferred basis, for purposes of determining OASDI eligibility based on income, where receiving income on a deferred basis for services performed in a previous year or years is a common practice in the business from which such income is derived. Prevents excess earnings from being charged to any month in which an individual did not engage in self-employment and did not render services for wages of more than the applicable exempt amount as determined under title II in calculating the deduction from an individual's benefits because of work. Extends Medicare hospital insurance benefits, available to individuals entitled to benefits under title II, to other individuals who would be entitled to benefits under title II except that such individuals have not applied for such benefits."
