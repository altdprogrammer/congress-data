    "text": "Municipal Waste-to-Energy Act of 1980 - Title I: Research, Development and Demonstration - Requires the Director of the Office of Urban Waste Energy Management (established under this Act) to establish, conduct, and promote an accelerated research, development, and demonstration program for the recovery of energy from municipal wastes. Directs the Director to provide financial assistance in the form of grants, contracts, price supports, purchase guarantees, loan guarantees and cooperative agreements, or any combination thereof, to public or private entities to support the cost of planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining experimental and demonstration facilities and modifications of existing facilities for demonstration purposes, for the conversion of municipal wastes into energy, or for the recovery of materials. Requires that such program be designed to achieve its goals within ten years after enactment of this Act. Amends the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to extend the financial support program to include public and private entity waste reprocessing demonstration facilities. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to carry out this title. Title II: Commercialization - Requires the Director to establish a program of financial assistance for commercial-scale projects designed for the conversion of municipal wastes into energy or the recovery of materials, including, in decreasing order of priority, price and loan guarantees, loans, and grants. Stipulates that such assistance shall be made to supplement but not to compete with nor supplant any private capital investment under authority of any other Federal law. Directs the Director to establish internal procedures, standards, and criteria for the timely review of compliance with such requirement of each new award of assistance for a specific proposed municipal waste processing project. Limits such financial assistance to a maximum of 75 percent of the total capital cost of that project. Prohibits any project receiving such assistance from thereafter being eligible for such assistance. Requires that any specific tax credit directly associated with such projects be considered in determining the need for financial assistance awarded under this title. Limits the amount of loans entered into for such projects to a maximum of 49 percent of the total capital costs of the project, unless the Director determines that such limit would prevent the financial viability of the proposed project. Sets forth requirements concerning the Director's authority to enter into, or make, such loans, loan guarantees, price guarantees, and grants. Directs the Director to conduct economic analyses of municipal waste-to-energy conversion technologies in other countries for publication and dissemination. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to carry out this title. Title III: General Provisions - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to establish an Office of Urban Waste Energy Management within the Department of Energy to perform the research, development, demonstration, and commercialization activities authorized under this Act. Directs the Director of such Office to prepare a program and management plan for such activities and to transmit such plan to specified congressional committees. Requires the Director to annually submit to the Congress a detailed description of such plan as in effect, with proposed modifications as necessary. Requires the Director to support science and engineering education programs to provide trained personnel to perform the activities required under this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other appropriate agency heads to cooperate with the Director in carrying out duties under this Act and to provide the Director with information in their possession which is necessary for such purposes. Requires the Director to assure the full and complete dissemination of information concerning any project or other activity conducted under this Act to Federal, State, and local authorities, relevant segments of the economy, the scientific community, and the public in order to promote the early, widespread, and practical use of municipal waste-to-energy technologies. Directs the Director, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Commerce, to prepare and transmit to the Congress a report analyzing and assessing legal impediments and other barriers to the development and application of such technologies. Sets forth the components of such report. States that amounts received by the Director as repayment of loans made under this Act and other specified amounts shall be deposited in the Federal Treasury as miscellaneous receipts."
