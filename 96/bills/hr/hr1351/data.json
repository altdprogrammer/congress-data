Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation on: (1) the number of audits conducted in the previous 12 month period; (2) a breakdown of individuals audited by income, geography, and profession; and (3) the number of individuals who filed erroneous returns during the previous 12 month period."
