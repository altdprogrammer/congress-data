    "date": "1979-04-10", 
    "text": "Aviation Safety and Noise Reduction Act - Title I: Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a single system of measuring noise and the impact of noise on individuals to be used to measure noise at airports and their surrounding areas and to establish land uses for such areas which are compatible with such noise levels. Allows airport operators to submit noise exposure maps to the Secretary setting forth the noncompatible uses in each area of the map, a description of the projected aircraft operations during 1985, and the ways in which such operations will affect such map. Requires the revision of such maps when changes in airports operations would create any new noncompatible use in areas surrounding an airport. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to authorize the Secretary to make grants to qualified airports for noise compatibility planning. Defines \"noise compatibility planning\" as the preparation of noise exposure maps and noise compatibility programs under this Act. Sets forth limitation regarding the amounts which may be obligated through such grant program. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1980 and beyond to carry out such grant program. Stipulates that noise compatibility programs be filed with the Secretary. Sets forth factors under which the Secretary shall approve noise compatibility programs. Stipulates that the Federal share of an approved program shall be 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 for noise compatibility program grants. Directs the Secretary to prepare noise exposure maps for specified airports near the District of Columbia. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the effectiveness of airport noise compatibility planning and programs and to submit a report regarding such study to Congress by January 1, 1982. Title II: Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to increase specified appropriations authorized pursuant to such Act for fiscal year 1980. Prohibits the Secretary from approving any airport development project involving the construction or extension of an runway at any general aviation airport which is located astride a line separating two countries within a single State unless such a project has been approved by the governing body of any incorporated village which is located entirely within five miles of the nearest boundary of such airport. Title III: Prohibits the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration from approving any plan for the replacement or reengining of civil United States turbojet aircraft which do not meet specified noise standards unless the operator of such an aircraft has entered into a binding contract by January 1, 1981, to purchase replacement or redesigned aircraft which meet specified noise standards and such replacement or reengined aircraft is scheduled for delivery prior to July 1, 1984. Prohibits the Secretary, after January 1, 1983, from issuing original airworthiness certificates for civil subsonic turbojet aircraft above a specified takeoff weight unless such aircraft meets specified noise standards. Prohibits, after January 1, 1985, the operation of aircraft registered in a foreign country which do not meet specified noise standards. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirements with respect to two-engine aircraft under specified conditions. Title IV: Directs the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress regarding the implementation of collision avoidance systems in the national air traffic control system."
