    "text": "National Water Resources Policy and Development Act of 1979 - Title I: Directs States to review periodically their water resources needs. Authorizes the States to request the Water Resources Council for detailed studies of specific water resources needs. Directs States to submit to the Council a list of authorized studies which have not been completed and which are necessary to meet identified water resources needs. Authorizes the appropriate Federal water resources agency to make detailed evaluations of specific water resources needs upon referral by the Council. Stipulates that the State or other non-Federal body must agree to pay ten percent of the costs of the study before any study may be initiated. Provides for State employees to work in coordination with the appropriate agency. Requires such agencies to assure that studies are equitably undertaken on a regional basis. Directs States to develop and submit to the Council annually a priority list of water resource needs and projects. Stipulates that such lists will be deemed approved after 60 days unless the Council finds that such list was developed without adequate public participation. Requires reports to be filed by the appropriate agency with the Council and appropriate States upon completion of studies of water resource projects. Provides for the authorization of construction of such projects upon: (1) certification by the Governor to the Council that a project is needed and entitled to priority consideration; and (2) recommendation of construction by the appropriate agency. Stipulates that if a Governor of a State affected by such project objects to the Council within 90 days, then such project must be authorized by Congress. Requires the States or other non-Federal bodies to agree to pay specified percentages of the costs of construction and operation of such projects. Permits the use of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to pay the non-Federal contribution for commercial inland navigation projects. Requires any revenues from such projects to be shared between the non-Federal interests and the participating Federal agencies based on their percentage contribution to the project. Sets forth the formula for allocating authorized funds by the Council among the States. Terminates projects authorized prior to this Act if: (1) construction has not begun within five years of enactment of this Act; and (2) the project is not on a State's priority list. Authorizes the Council to study and propose legislation authorizing construction of regional water resources projects which have national significance and priority. Directs the Council to select up to 25 of such projects from among projects authorized prior to enactment of this Act which shall be eligible for direct funding by Congress without regard to specific limitations in this Act. Stipulates that such projects, if authorized specifically by Congress, shall be constructed at full Federal cost. Permits States to apply to the Council for loans to finance the construction of projects authorized prior to this Act. Requires the Council to report to Congress concerning: (1) national priorities for water resources development; (2) the needs for cost-effective development of the projects; and (3) the best ways to achieve the maximum efficient use of water supplies from existing Federal projects. Prohibits the construction of water resource projects designed to bring land into production for crops receiving Federal price supports until such studies are submitted. Title II: Amends the Water Resources Planning Act to provide for an independent Water Resources Council. Revises the composition of such Council to include experts in the engineering or economics of water resources development."
