    "text": "Title I: Amendments to Energy Policy and Conservation Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to add a new part relating to synthetic fuel production. Declares that it is a national goal to have a domestic commercial production of synthetic fuels and synthetic chemical feedstocks at a daily rate equivalent to 500,000 barrels of crude oil, beginning five years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes the President to enter into contracts to purchase or commit to purchase synthetic fuels and/or chemical feedstocks to the extent necessary to assure the attainment of such goal and to provide that such fuels and feedstocks be used to meet the Government's fuel and chemical requirements. Authorizes the storage of such fuels and feedstocks in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Sets forth criteria for the making of such contracts by competitive bidding procedures. Directs the President to submit annual reports to the Congress on actions taken under this title. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000,000 for carrying out the purposes of this title. Title II: Priority Energy Project Act - Priority Energy Project Act of 1979 - Declares that the purpose of this title is to provide for a coordinated, simplified, and expeditious process for Federal approval of non-nuclear energy facilities that are determined to be in the national interest. Directs the Secretary of Energy to designate priority energy projects based on specified criteria, and to publish a Project Decision Schedule containing deadlines for all Federal actions relating to such project. Directs the President to make any decisions or perform any actions in the event that an agency or department fails to meet its deadline. Limits judicial reviews to those of absolute necessity. Authorizes the Secretary to establish deadlines for Federal agency action which are shorter than the minimum period required under existing legislation in cases of exceptional national need. Provides for coordination of the actions of Federal, State, and local governments. Directs the Secretary to recommend to any State Governor and to the Congress actions to alleviate or prevent any delays in a priority energy project created or threatened by any State or local government. Sets time limits for filing claims arising out of actions pursuant to this title and bars any claims filed thereafter. Stipulates that such claims shall be brought in the United States court of appeals for the circuit where the project would be located, and grants exclusive original jurisdiction to such court in such matters. Directs such court to give precedence to such matters over all other matters on the court's docket to the greatest extent practicable. Authorizes the Supreme Court, exclusively, to review interlocutory judgments or orders of the court of appeals pursuant to this title, and directs the Supreme Court to give precedence to such matters to the greatest extent practicable. Establishes an Office for Priority Energy Projects within the Department of Energy to assist the Secretary with his duties under this title. Terminates the Secretary's authority to designate priority energy projects seven years after the date of enactment of this Act."
