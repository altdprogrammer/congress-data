Directs the President to prepare and submit to Congress, within 120 days after enactment of this Act, guidelines for preparing such assessments. Requires agencies to review existing rules, upon their own motion or upon petition of any interested person, to compare costs and benefits to the public of such rules. Requires each committee of Congress to include such an assessment in the committee report of any legislation which may have a significant economic impact."
