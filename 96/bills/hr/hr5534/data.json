Limits the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress, Delegates to the House of Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leader of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the Speaker of the House to the rate payable for such positions for September 30, 1978. Requires the annual rates of pay for Members of Congress to be adjusted, effective January 3, 1981, by specified amounts, only at the beginning of the Congress following the Congress during which the adjustments were approved. Specifies that such adjustment shall take effect only if Congress provided for a balanced budget for the preceding fiscal year. Prohibits any congressional employee from being paid at a rate in excess of the pay rate payable for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives."
