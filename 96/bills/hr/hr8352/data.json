Appropriates to the Trust Fund amounts received in the Treasury equivalent to any windfall profit taxes imposed on domestic crude oil production. Stipulates that such amounts shall be transferred at least monthly from the general fund of the Treasury to the Trust Fund. Requires that the amounts in the Trust Fund be used only for the payment, purchase, or redemption of any obligations included in the public debt. Stipulates that all such obligations shall be canceled and retired and shall not be reissued. Repeals provisions of the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 which set up the Windfall Profit Tax Account in the Treasury and direct the allocation of amounts deposited therein."
