    "text": "Tax Reform Act for Nonprofit Organizations - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers who do not itemize income tax deductions a deduction from gross income for charitable contributions. Expands the income tax deduction for appearances with respect to legislation to include expenses for communications between an organization and the officers, directors, or employees of a taxpayer. Exempts certain business and professional organizations from restrictions on income tax deductions for expenses relating to the supply of goods and services to members. Permits members of tax-exempt organizations to participate in educational activities sponsored by the organization or purchase goods and services related to the organization's exempt activities at prices more favorable than are available to nonmembers without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of the organization. Extends to nonprofit business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, and professional football leagues eligibility for participation in tax-exempt annuity plans. Exempts certain incorporated fraternal organizations and lodges from the special tax rules applicable to private foundations. Limits the amount of advertising income of a tax-exempt organization which is subject to the tax on unrelated business income to the lesser of the amount of net income derived from advertising or the net amount derived from subscriptions to the organization's periodical and the advertising contained therein. Excludes from unrelated business activity income certain amounts derived from insurance activity conducted by a tax-exempt organization on behalf of its members. Permits tax-exempt organizations to conduct conventions and trade show activities designed to educate individuals regarding new developments or products and services relating to the exempt activities of an organization without subjecting such exempt organization to the unrelated business tax. Exempts from the definition of expenditure, for purposes of the tax on political organizations, expenses incurred by an organization in communicating with its members on any subject. Extends the availability of the declaratory judgment to all tax-exempt organizations. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make a determination, upon request, of the tax-exempt status of any organization within 90 days of such request."
