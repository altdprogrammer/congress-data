Enables such a guarantee to be made even if the application and/or the total outstanding debt of a unit of local government fails to meet statutory requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to accept as security to assure repayment of such guaranteed debt: (1) a commitment by a local government to impose a unit surcharge on water; or (2) other financial resources of a local government."
