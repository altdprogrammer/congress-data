Stipulates that such value be based on the costs, expenses, and profits of free-market producers of such merchandise most comparable to the nonmarket economy producers. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the International Trade Commission to investigate, and the President to request an investigation into, whether the domestic market is disrupted due to imports from or artificial pricing by nonmarket economy countries (currently Communist countries). Revises the relief available as a result of such disruption caused by artificial pricing to: (1) require the President to take the action recommended by the Commission, unless Congress approves different action by the President; and (2) exempt such relief from specified restrictions."
