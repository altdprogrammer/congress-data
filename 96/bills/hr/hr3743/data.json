Directs the Secretary of the Navy, in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, to conduct a study of the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 and to submit such report to Congress with recommendations regarding: (1) the percentage of the United States share of petroleum in such reserve which should be placed in strategic storage facilities; (2) the most desirable rate of production of such reserve to meet the requirements of this Act; and (3) the most environmentally sound means of transporting the United States share of such petroleum to storage facilities of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Transfers the functions of the Department of Energy with respect to the Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3 and the Oil Shale Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3 to the Secretary of the Navy."
