    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to grant an additional allotment of funds for the construction of publicly owned waste treatment works to any State which has obligated 90 percent or more of the funds previously allotted to it for such purpose by March 31 of any fiscal year. Makes such additional funds available for the fiscal year for which such funds were authorized, and for the succeeding 12 months. Provides that any funds unobligated at the end of such period be allotted equally among the other States. Makes adjustments in the amount of additional funds allocated for a State where funds previously authorized proved inadequate. Authorizes appropriations for such additional funds. Sets the amount of funds authorized to be reserved each fiscal year to two percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for allotments to States under this program. Makes funds allotted to the States for fiscal year 1978 available for the next succeeding 24 months. Provides for the reallotment of funds not obligated at the end of such period to all States except those which failed to obligate any of the funds being reallotted. Stipulates that such reallotted funds be in addition to those otherwise allotted to such State for grants under this program."
