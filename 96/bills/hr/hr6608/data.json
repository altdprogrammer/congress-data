    "text": "Infant Formula Act of 1980 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to set forth requirements for infant formulas. States that formulas which do not conform to such requirements shall be deemed to be adulterated. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (formerly the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare) to make revisions of and exemptions to such requirements. Requires each manufacturer of an infant formula to: (1) semiannually submit to the Secretary reports or test results which show that the formula meets such requirements; (2) promptly notify the Secretary upon determination that a processed formula which has left an establishment subject to the manufacturer's control may be adulterated or misbranded; and (3) report to the Secretary at 14 day intervals during a recall. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe the scope and extent of recalls of adulterated infant formulas to effectively remove them from commercial distribution; (2) review, at 15 day intervals, a manufacturer's actions during a recall; and (3) report annually to Congress on changes, or recommendations for changes, in the list of requirements under this Act. Permits an inspector enforcing the provisions of this Act access to specified test records of the manufacturer at all times. Makes the failure to submit required reports and test results a prohibited act under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
