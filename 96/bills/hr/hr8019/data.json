Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and Housing and Urban Development, to prescribe solar construction credit tables, providing for a credit at the rate of $60 for each 1,000,000 Btu's of annual energy savings per residential unit. Limits the amount of the credit to $2,000 per residential unit. Terminates the authority for such credit for residential units completed after December 31, 1988."
