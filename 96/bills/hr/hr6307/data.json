    "text": "Authorizes the United States Postal Service to demand to buy from any person any article or service offered for sale by mail. Declares that failure by such person to comply with such demand shall constitute probable cause to believe such person is using the mail to conduct a lottery or a scheme to obtain money or property by means of a false representation. Sets forth a civil penalty to be assessed against any person who evades, attempts to evade, or acts in defiance of an order which is issued by the Postal Service upon finding satisfactory evidence the person is using the mail for such a purpose, and which: (1) requires a postmaster to return any mail addressed to such person; or (2) prohibits the postmaster from paying any money order or postal note for such person. Entitles any person against whom a penalty is assessed to: (1) an advance notice of the penalty specifying the charges warranting the penalty; (2) a reasonable time to answer the charges; and (3) a written decision at the earliest practical date. Directs the Postal Service, upon the request of such person, to provide for a hearing on such charges. Declares that the decision of the Postal Service shall be final unless it is appealed to any court of appeals of the United States within a specified period of time. Authorizes the Postal Service to request any district court of the United States to issue an order requiring compliance with such a demand or order of the Postal Service."
