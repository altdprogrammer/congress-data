Directs the President to: (1) adjust such ceilings for every agency four times a year; (2) establish ceilings for new agencies; and (3) transmit such adjustments and new ceilings to Congress. States that such adjustments and ceilings shall take effect unless either house of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving them within 60 days of transmittal. Requires the President to prescribe guidelines for determining personnel costs."
