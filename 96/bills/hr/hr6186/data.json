    "text": "National Technology Innovation Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish and maintain an Office of Industrial Technology to enhance technological innovation for the improvement of the economic, environmental and social well-being of the United States. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the President and Congress, within three years after the date of enactment of this Act, a report on the progress, findings, recommendations, and conclusions of activities conducted. Requires the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint a Director of the Office who shall provide assistance for the establishment of Centers of Industrial Technology, whose activities shall include: (1) research supportive of technology and industrial innovation including cooperative industry-university basic and applied research; (2) assistance in the evaluation and development of technological ideas supportive of industrial innovation and new business ventures; (3) technological assistance and advisory services to industry; and (4) curriculum development and instruction in invention, entrepreneurship, and industrial innovation. Declares that such centers shall be affiliated with a university or nonprofit institution, and authorizes the Director to make available nonrenewable planning grants to such universities or nonprofit institutions for the purpose of developing a plan for the management and evaluation of the activities proposed within the particular Center, including the consideration of means to place the Center on a self-sustaining basis. Declares that each Center has the option of acquiring title to any invention conceived under the auspices of the Center that was supported at least in part by Federal funds and that the Secretary shall obtain title to any invention for which such option is not exercised. Authorizes the Director to make grants and enter into cooperative agreements to assist any activity established under this Act. Prohibits any such grant or cooperative agreement from exceeding 75 percent of the total cost of the program or project involved. Sets forth the terms and conditions for such grants or cooperative agreements. Requires the Director to seek the advice and cooperation of departments and agencies whose missions contribute to or are affected by the programs established under this Act. Authorizes the Director to receive moneys from other departments and agencies to support activities of the Centers. Establishes an independent committee to be known as the Industrial Technology Review Panel which shall review annually the activities of the Office and advise the Secretary and the Director with respect to such activities. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act through fiscal year 1984."
