    "text": "Disaster Relief Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to require the President to immediately provide the Federal disaster assistance requested by a Governor whenever such Governor declares and requests a determination by the President that an emergency or major disaster exists. Requires States to reimburse the Federal Government for such assistance, if the President determines that the emergency or major disaster does not exist or that the amount of assistance exceeds the amount required. Stipulates that a State's budget surplus or deficit shall not be taken into account when recommending to the President whether to declare an emergency or major disaster. Revises the definition of \"emergency\" to include a catastrophe requiring Federal emergency assistance to restore normal delivery of essential services. Eliminates the requirement that appropriate action by the Governor under State law is a prerequisite to major disaster assistance. Deletes the requirement that the Governor certify that State and local governments will spend a reasonable amount of their funds, and instead requires the Governor to certify that State and local governments have made maximum efforts given the circumstances and resources available. Directs the President to appoint a Federal coordinating officer and to request the Governor to designate a State coordinating officer to operate in the affected area upon the Governor's request for declaration of an emergency or major disaster (currently, such officer is appointed or requested upon the President's declaration)."
