Requires the effective separation of smokers from non-smokers in certain areas of such facilities. Requires that nonsmoking employees in Federal facilities be given the opportunity to be assigned to physically distinct offices or workplaces from those who smoke, whenever possible. Makes the executive head or chief administrative officer of each instrumentality responsible for the enforcement of these prohibitions in any Federal facility in which such instrumentality maintains offices. Requires such officers to submit an annual report on the enforcement of these prohibitions to the Administrator of General Services. Establishes civil penalties for individuals who smoke in any area of an interstate passenger carrier facility where smoking is prohibited under this Act. Requires that \"No Smoking\" signs be posted in specified areas."
