    "text": "Emergency Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Conservation Act of 1979 - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to establish an emergency gasoline and diesel oil conservation program. Defines \"fuel\" as gasoline and diesel oil. Imposes a $5 minimum fuel purchase requirement upon all fuel consumers. Stipulates that such purchase requirement shall apply in every State where: (1) the Governor of such State submits a request to the Secretary of Energy to have such requirements applicable therein; and (2) the Governor of such State lacks the authority to invoke comparable requirements but the State could administer and enforce the Federal requirements under a delegation of authority pursuant to Federal law; or (3) the President has found that nationwide implementation of such purchase requirements would be appropriate. Exempts from such minimum purchase requirements motorcycles, motorpowered bicycles, or comparable vehicles, as determined by the Secretary's regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust the minimum purchase level in certain circumstances. Imposes a fine of up to $100 for violation of such requirements. Stipulates that compliance with such requirements shall not be considered a violation of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 or any Federal or State law requiring labeling or disclosure of the maximum price per gallon of fuel. Directs the President to establish emergency fuel conservation targets for the Nation generally and for such State. Bases such targets on a uniform percentage reduction in fuel usage as compared to fuel usage during a uniform base period considered appropriate by the President, taking into consideration past and projected fuel supply and demand nationally and in each State, international commitments, and other appropriate factors. Authorizes the President to adjust such targets where considered appropriate. Directs the Secretary to determine and publish monthly in the Federal Register national and State fuel consumption levels and success with meeting the targets. Directs the Governor of each State to submit to the Secretary a State emergency fuel conservation plan designed to meet or exceed targets established for such State. Authorizes the Secretary to extend for good cause the 45 day period for submission of such plans. Sets forth criteria for State emergency fuel conservation plans to reduce public and private use of fuel, and criteria for the Secretary's approval of such plans. Delegates administrative and enforcement authority for approved State plans to the Governor of a State and other State and local officers and employees designated by the Governor. Imposes a fine of up to $100 for violation of State plan provisions. Directs the Governor of each State to submit to the Secretary reports and information on that State's plan, as necessary. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds or other assistance under the program of Federal assistance to States for development, implementation, or modification of State energy conservation plans under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for failure to submit a plan. Directs the Secretary to establish a standby emergency fuel conservation sticker plan to restrict operation of automobiles on specified days, with exceptions for emergency uses, off-highway agricultural uses, national defense uses, taxicab or similar common carrier uses, rental automobile use, United States Postal Service uses, regulated commercial uses, and other uses determined by the Secretary to require an exemption. Directs the President to implement such sticker plan in any State for which the Secretary finds that fuel conservation targets have not been met. Directs the President to implement such plan nationally upon a finding that: (1) implementing such plan is required by a severe energy supply interruption or in order to fulfill international energy program obligations, pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; or (2) fuel conservation targets established by this Act have not been met, and upon transmission of such finding to the Congress with a statement of the effective date of such measure. Authorizes the States to administer and enforce such plan. Sets forth the Secretary's responsibilities in establishing such plan, including preparation and distribution of stickers and collection of fees. Imposes a fine of up to $100 for violation of such plan. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the commercial and industrial storage of gasoline and middle distillates in specified storage facilities. Sets forth the components of such report. Delegates to the Governor of any State, and other State and local officers and employees designated by the Governor, the authority to administer and enforce this Act. Revokes such delegation upon written request for waiver of authority signed by the Governor or upon the President's determination that such delegation be revoked. Authorizes States to retain fees and penalties collected pursuant to this Act to cover administrative and enforcement costs. Directs the Secretary to use the authority provided under the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to secure any information necessary to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue interim and final regulations necessary to carry out this Act. Requires the Secretary to review actions taken under this Act and to submit to each House of Congress a report thereon, with any appropriate recommendations. Terminates this Act and any actions taken thereunder 18 months after the date of enactment, with specified exceptions. Makes technical amendments to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. Provides that, for the purposes of funding the provisions of this Act for fiscal years 1979 and 1980, this Act shall be treated as a contingency plan under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act."
