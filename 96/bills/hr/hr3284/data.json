Prescribes the duties and authority of the officers of the FPS which primarily involve the protection of persons and property on real property under the control of the Administration. Includes such officers within provisions which: (1) concern the protection of officers of the United States; and (2) prohibit requiring certain policemen to use sick leave for an absence due to an injury sustained in the performance of duty. Requires the United States to make a lump sum payment of $50,000 to the survivors of a Federal law enforcement officer or fire fighter who dies as a result of such an injury."
