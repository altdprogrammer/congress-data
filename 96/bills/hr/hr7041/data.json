Allows the Secretary to approve payment of such premiums on an annual basis if the financial institution, mortgagee, or agent thereof pays interest, at a rate specified by the Secretary, to the insurance fund for the period beginning 20 days after receipt from the borrower and ending upon payment of the premiums to the Federal government."
