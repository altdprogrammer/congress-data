Requires the FCC to make such financial information available for public inspection within 30 days after receiving such information, and to provide a copy of such information to any person upon written request. Allows the FCC to require any person receiving a copy of such information to pay a reasonable fee or to furnish a copy without charge, or at a reduced charge, if the Chairman of the Commission determines that a reduction or waiver of the fee is in the public interest. Requires any broadcast station licensee filing financial information with the FCC to make such information available for public inspection, and to provide copies of such information to any person."
