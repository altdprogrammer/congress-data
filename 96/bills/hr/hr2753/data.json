Requires any rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission to balance any proposed rate increase based on seasonal or peak-period demand for rail services with an appropriately reduced off-peak rate so that the net result is that no person who ships or receives goods year-round will be subjected to a fare increase."
