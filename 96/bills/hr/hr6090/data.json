    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-12-11", 
    "text": "Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to exempt from applicable Federal regulations any State having in effect a law, rule, or regulation applicable to underground injection control related to the production or recovery of oil or natural gas unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency finds that such law, rule, or regulation fails to protect underground sources of drinking water. Provides that any State for which such finding is made may amend its law, rule, or regulation in order to benefit from such exemption where approved by the Administrator. Exempts from the Federal underground injection well permit requirements any State having in effect such law, rule, or regulation approved by the Administrator. Amends the definition of \"underground injection\" to exclude the underground injection of natural gas for purposes of storage. Exempts from the administrative procedure and judicial review requirements of the United States Code any action relating to national interim primary drinking water regulations, revised national primary drinking water regulations, and regulations for State underground injection control programs, except as expressly provided by this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish a docket for such actions, and sets forth notice and public and agency commenting requirements for any proposed rulemaking. Sets forth procedures and other requirements for promulgating rules concerning drinking water regulations, and establishes procedures for judicial review of such actions. Amends the definition of \"primary drinking water regulation\" to revise the standard for the promulgation of such regulations, and makes conforming amendments as necessary. Amends such definition to delete the provision calling for the specification of treatment techniques for those contaminants for which it is not feasible to establish maximum levels, and deletes subsequent references to treatment technique requirements. Requires any State having primary enforcement responsibility to submit notice to the Administrator that its public water system supervision program conforms to any revision or amendment to any national primary drinking water regulation made by the Administrator. States that failure to submit such notice shall be grounds for withdrawal of State primary enforcement responsibility. Amends such Act to authorize a State having such enforcement responsibility to exempt from maximum contaminant level requirements any public water system not having any reasonable alternative source of drinking water available. Revises the dates for compliance by public water systems with contaminant level requirements. Extends the effective date for State underground injection control regulations approved by the Administrator. Authorizes the waiver of the prohibition against State grants being made for any period beginning more than one year after the date of a State's first grant having been made for a period of 18 months after the effective date of any amendment or revision of the national primary drinking water regulations if the State has assumed primary enforcement responsibility and is making diligent efforts to comply with such amendment or revision. Prohibits the Administrator from making grants to any State unless the State has assumed primary enforcement responsibility within two years after the Administrator promulgates State underground injection control program regulations. Amends the emergency powers provisions of such Act to limit the Administrator's authority to issue orders necessary to protect the health of persons to those situations where the commencement of a civil action alone would not be practicable and limits the duration of such orders to 24 hours unless such civil action is commenced. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) conduct a study of any health effects which result from exposure to barium, barium ion, radium, or any combination thereof, in concentrations greater than the maximum level specified in the interim regulations; and (2) conduct an epidemiological study of the occurrence of fluorosis in areas served by public water systems subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act in which fluoride from natural resources occurs in concentrations greater than the maximum contaminant level specified in such regulations. Requires that a report on the results of such studies be submitted to Congress as promptly as possible. Exempts from the application of national interim primary drinking water regulations any drinking water system which serves an area in which barium, barium ion, radium, or fluoride from natural resources exceeds the maximum contaminant level specified in such regulations. Exempts, until one year after the submission of the report required above, from the application of revised natural primary drinking water regulations any such area containing such substances."
