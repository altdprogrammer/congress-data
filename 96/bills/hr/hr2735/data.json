Sets forth grant application requirements which include providing assurance that such Federal funds will not replace State or local funding. Requires the application to be submitted for review to the State Governor, whose comments and recommendations shall accompany the application of the OPM. Authorizes the OPM to: (1) provide technical advice and assistance to such governments for improving productivity; and (2) make grants to organizations which represent or advise such governments to pay the costs of programs to improve government efficiency. Requires an equitable distribution of such grants among States and between State and local governments. Directs the Comptroller General to audit and report to Congress on the implementation of this Act."
