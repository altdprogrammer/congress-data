    "text": "Extends specified farm housing programs of the Farmers Home Administration under the Housing Act of 1949. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 for: (1) loans and grants for the repair of or improvements to rural dwellings and financial assistance to provide low-rent housing for domestic farm labor; (2) research and study programs for buildings and repairs of farm dwellings and facilities; (3) loans and grants for mutual and self-help housing programs in rural areas and small towns; (4) the Self-Help Housing Land Development Fund; and (5) grants for the development of technical and supervisory assistance programs in rural areas with Federal, State, and local housing programs for low-income families. Increases the maximum obligations of the loans insured for housing for domestic farm labor. Extends the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to insure loans which provide rental and cooperative housing for the elderly or others of low- and moderate-incomes and to insure and make loans using the Rural Housing Insurance Fund for housing and buildings on farms owned by low-or moderate-income families. Repeals the requirement that, in order for the Secretary of Agriculture to extend financial assistance, through the Farmers Home Administration, to specified owners of farms or real estate in rural areas for refinancing indebtedness, such indebtedness must be incurred at least five years prior to the application for assistance. Requires the Secretary to allocate assistance for housing to households which have incomes below the national median income. Authorizes the Secretary to make and insure loans for up to 100 percent of the units in multifamily rental or cooperative housing projects and related facilities for domestic farm labor, the elderly, and persons and families of low income in rural areas. Makes provisions for the payment by the Secretary out of the Rural Housing Insurance Fund for the correction of, or compensation to homeowners for, significant construction defects in certain newly constructed assisted homes. Includes among the administrative powers of the Secretary the authority to repair and rehabilitate property pledged or mortgaged under the Housing Act of 1949 and purchased by the Secretary at any foreclosure. Sets forth restrictions on the sale or disposition of such property. Allows the Secretary to provide up to 90 percent of the development costs of housing for migrant farmworkers while they are away from their residence. Authorizes the Secretary to provide rental assistance for 100 percent of the units in such housing whenever any loan or financial assistance is used exclusively for the development of newly constructed housing. Requires assurances from recipients of assistance under the Housing Act of 1949 that rural housing projects which are refinanced or prepaid will continue to be used for their original purposes and that no person occupying the housing shall be required to vacate because of such a transaction. Expands the authority of the Secretary to contract for services facilitating public and private nonprofit entities in providing technical and supervisory assistance to low-income individuals who are participating in mutual self-help housing in rural areas and small towns. Authorizes the Secretary to make and insure loans to residents in rural areas to assure that every occupied dwelling unit has a running potable water supply and a safe and sanitary waste disposal system. Establishes an Assistant Secretary for Equal Opportunity within the Department of Agriculture, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."
