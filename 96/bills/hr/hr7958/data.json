    "text": "Entitles a former spouse of a Federal employee or Member of Congress to a survivor annuity if elected, and to the extent provided in an election, by such employee or Member or provided by any court decree of divorce or annulment. Limits the amount of such survivor annuity to not more than 55 percent of the full annuity of such employee or Member. Terminates the survivor annuity on the last day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 60. Limits the total survivor annuities which may be provided with respect to a Member or employee to 55 percent of the annuity of such employee or Member. Prohibits any adjustment in the amount of a survivor annuity provided to a former spouse after the death of the employee or Member. Provides for a reduction in the annuity of an employee or Member electing such survivor annuity. Permits the employee or Member to continue such reduction upon termination of the former spouse's eligibility for the survivor annuity, in order to provide for a higher survivor annuity for any current spouse. Allows a Member or employee providing such a survivor annuity to a former spouse to elect an additional survivor annuity for another former spouse or surviving spouse, if the employee or Member passes a physical exam prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Requires such employee or Member to provide for such annuity by a reduction in his or her annuity or salary, or by a lump sum payment. Terminates such survivor annuity upon the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 60. Declares that provisions regarding cost of living increases in civil service annuities shall not apply to such a survivor annuity unless authorized by OPM. Prohibits an employee or Member who elects to provide a survivor annuity for another individual, other than any current spouse."
