Limits the amount of basis to which the investment tax credit is applicable to $10,000. Allows a residential energy credit for solar energy property if the original use of such property begins with the taxpayer as the lessee of such property. Allows a residential energy credit with respect to solar energy property to the extent such property performs a solar function. Allows the amortization of solar energy property based on a 36 month period."
