    "text": "Title I: Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1980 - Establishes authorization ceilings for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be used for nuclear reactor regulation, inspection and enforcement, standards development, nuclear material safety and safeguards, nuclear regulatory research, program technical support, and program direction and administration. Limits the Commission's authority to reprogram funds for a specific line item by an increase or decrease in excess of $500,000 for a period of 30 calendar days after notifying the appropriate committees of Congress, unless each committee has transmitted a written notice stating it has no objections to the proposed action. Directs the Commission to establish a Senior Contract Review Board to review placements or modifications of contracts with Federal agencies or for research services in excess of $500,000, with any such contract in excess of $1,000,000 requiring the approval of a majority of the Commission. Authorizes the Commission to retain moneys received for cooperative research programs for salaries and expenses for such programs and to transfer sums from salaries and expenses to other government agencies which perform work for which the appropriation was made. Authorizes the Commission to use the amount of authorized funds necessary to: (1) establish standards for State radiological emergency expense plans for any facility required to be licensed by the Atomic Energy Act; (2) review all plans and other preparations respecting such an emergency made by each State which may be in some way affected by such emergency; (3) assess the adequacy of such plans and the ability of the States involved to effectuate emergency evacuations; (4) identify which States do not have adequate preparations and notify the Governor forthwith; and (5) submit a report to Congress containing results and recommendations. Directs the Commission, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Transportation, to promulgate regulations requiring that timely notice be provided to the Governor of a State prior to the transportation of nuclear materials from commercial facilities through or within the jurisdiction of such State. Title II: Authority to Make Payments - Authorizes payments under this Act only to the extent such amounts are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Title III: Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 by increasing the maximum civil penalty which the Commission can impose for single license violations from $5,000 to $100,000, and removes the maximum total penalty ceiling. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the Commission to protect certain unclassified but sensitive nuclear safeguards information from public disclosure. Subjects to civil penalties violators of regulations or orders issued to prevent such disclosures."
