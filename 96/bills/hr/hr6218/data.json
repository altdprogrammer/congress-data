    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1980-12-09", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Designates the following National Forest System lands in the State of Florida as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Billies Bay Wilderness, the Alexander Springs Wilderness (prohibits the restriction of existing motor boat use on Alexander Springs Creek), the Little Lake George Wilderness, and the Juniper Prairie Wilderness, all in the Ocala National Forest; (2) the Bradwell Bay Wilderness and the Mud Swamp New/River Wilderness both in the Apalachicola National Forest. Designates as wilderness and adds to the Florida Keys Wilderness certain lands referred to as North Cudhoe Key, located in Monroe County, Florida. Specifies that such designation shall be effective on the date such lands are included in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Withdraws from such wilderness the lands referred to as Racoon Key, Florida. Makes the withdrawal of such lands from the National Wilderness Preservation System effective on the date such lands are withdrawn from the National Wildlife Refuge System. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish a notice in the Federal Register and to notify Congress if the United States acquires any lands on Racoon Key, Florida. Declares that all lands on Racoon Key so acquired on or after the date of enactment of this Act shall be added to and incorporated within the Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge and the Florida Keys Wilderness. Declares that the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II) Final Environmental Statement (dated January 1979) with respect to National Forest System lands in States other than Florida shall not be subject to judicial review with respect to National Forest System lands in that State. Deems the review of the National Forest System lands in the State of Florida by RARE II, except those lands remaining in further planning upon enactment of this Act, to be an adequate consideration of the suitability of such lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Provides that the Department of Agriculture shall not be required to review the wilderness option prior to the revision of the initial plans and in no case prior to the date established by law for completion of the initial planning cycle. Declares that areas reviewed in such Final Environmental Statement and not designated as wilderness or for study by this Act or remaining in further planning upon enactment of this Act need not be managed for the purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness designation pending revision of the initial plans. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture, unless expressly authorized by Congress, from conducting any further statewide Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of National Forest System lands in the State of Florida for the purpose of determining their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Exempts the Osceloa National Forest, Florida, from such requirements and prohibitions."
