Requires a well to be producing at the maximum feasible rate throughout a 12-month period in order to qualify for such exemption. Directs that deep stripper well crude oil which is high water-cut crude oil shall be treated as if each barrel limitation were one barrel higher for each full percentage point by which the water cut exceeds 90 percent."
