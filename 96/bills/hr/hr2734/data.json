Requires State regulatory electric and gas utilities to make available to the public weekly reports of involuntary terminations of service to consumers. Provides that during any period when termination of service to an electric or gas consumer would be dangerous to health, such service may not be terminated if the consumer establishes that he or she is able to pay in accordance with a qualified deferred payment program."
