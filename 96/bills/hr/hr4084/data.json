Specifies the requirements of such agreement which include requirements that; (1) the State of California construct and operate certain water control facilities in the Marsh; and (2) the Federal share of the costs of implementing such agreement shall be 50 percent. States that the share of costs may be altered and applied retroactively to such control facilities upon authorization of the development of a more extensive system of preservation facilities for the Marsh area. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for the Federal share of costs of the construction and operation of such control facilities."
