Declares that lands which represent potential wilderness additions, upon publication in the Federal Register of a notice by the Secretary of the Interior that all uses prohibited thereon by the Wilderness Act have ceased, shall be designated as wilderness. Directs the Secretary pending such designation, to administer such lands in such manner as to preserve their wilderness or potential wilderness character. Specifies that wilderness designation shall not preclude the repair of beaches that occur in the wilderness area, in order to prevent loss of life, flooding, and other severe economic physical damage to the Great South Bay and surrounding areas. Limits, to $500,000, the amount of funds available for development in the Fire Island National Seashore. Declares that the authority to enter into contracts, to incur obligations, or to make payments under this Act shall be effective only to the extent, and in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts."
