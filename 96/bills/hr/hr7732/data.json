    "text": "Title I: Purposes and Definitions - Sets forth the purposes of this Act. Excludes nuclear energy production projects from coverage under this Act. Title II: Priority Projects - Authorizes the President to establish an Energy Mobilization Board to be composed of members appointed by the President. Sets forth the general duties and powers of such Board, including the subpoena power. Directs the Board to keep the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs and on Interstate and Foreign Commerce fully informed concerning its activities, including the submission of an annual report. Directs the Board to promulgate regulations establishing criteria for applications for an order designating an energy project as a Priority Energy Project. Requires the Board to publish notice of the application and to allow time after such publication for agencies and interested persons to submit written comments. Requires the Board to order designation as a Priority Energy Project or to refuse to make such an order within a specified time. Sets forth the criteria the Board shall consider in deciding whether to make such a designation. Requires the Board to publish its decision and a report on its findings for each of the criteria. Stipulates that any action by the Board in designating a priority energy project shall not be considered as a \"major Federal action\" for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Directs the Council on Environmental Quality to determine whether any Federal action relating to the Priority Energy Project, after it has been so designated and prior to establishing the Project Schedule, will be a \"major Federal action\" for purposes of compliance with NEPA, and if so, to designate the lead agency. Limits the number of Priority Energy Projects which can be pending certification at any one time to twenty-four. Allows the Board to extend deadlines for receiving comments, for making determinations, and for submitting information. Requires each agency having authority to make any agency decision with respect to any part of a project designated as a Priority Energy Project to transmit to the Board specified information. Directs the Board to publish a Project Decision Schedule to clearly identify the order in which decisions relating to a Priority Energy Project must be obtained. Requires the Schedule to be consistent with tentative schedules submitted to the Board and with the statutory obligations of the agencies governed such schedule. Allows the Board to modify the Schedule and to extend the time period applicable to an agency or applicant if the Board determines that certain conditions exist. Prohibits any deadline or extension from resulting in total time for agency action exceeding nine months. Directs the Board to monitor compliance with the Schedule. Requires the Board to determine the cause of any delay, to notify the appropriate agencies and other persons of its determination, and to publish its findings. Authorizes the Board to establish appropriate procedures to bring any agency responsible for a delay into compliance with the Schedule. Directs the Board, when a Priority Energy Project has failed or refused to take an action necessary for an agency decision, to revise such Schedule or to revoke the Priority Energy Project designation. Requires the President to make the final decision on a project if a Federal agency fails to act. Prohibits the President from making a decision unless there has been notice and an opportunity for public comment on such decision. Allows a Federal agency or a Priority Energy Project to request a deadline extension from the President. Sets forth the factors the President must consider in making the final decision and in deciding whether to grant a deadline extension. Directs the Board to certify that all agency actions and approvals necessary for a Priority Energy Project have been granted. Requires the termination of the Priority Energy Project designation if a negative decision is rendered by a competent authority. Requires the Board to notify the Governor of any State within which any portion of a Priority Energy Project would be located and to request certain information from the Governor. Directs the Board to transmit information received from State and local governments to the Priority Energy Project and to help coordinate Federal, State and local authorities. Requires the Board to notify the appropriate Governor of the unwillingness or inability of the State or local government to implement a schedule for timely review and to transmit to the Congress a description of the delay and a recommendation of action to alleviate or prevent the delay. Authorizes waivers of Federal, State, or local law upon the Board's determination that any Federal, State, or local time requirement for agency action is unreasonable and would impede the making of any agency decision. Specifies the procedure for obtaining such waivers. Title III: Judicial Review and Miscellaneous Provisions - Limits judicial review to cases involving alleged denial of rights under the United States Constitution or violations of statutory jurisdiction, authority, limitations, or rights. Sets time limits for filing claims arising out of actions taken pursuant to this Act, and bars any claims filed thereafter. Requires such claims to be brought in the district court of the district in which the Priority Energy Project would be located, and grants exclusive original jurisdiction to such court in such matters. Directs such court to give precedence to such matters over all other matters on the court's docket, to the greatest extent practicable. Authorizes the Supreme Court, exclusively, to review interlocutory judgments or orders of the district court pursuant to this title. Directs the Supreme Court to give precedence to such matters. Terminates the Board's authority to designate priority projects seven years after the date of enactment of this Act."
