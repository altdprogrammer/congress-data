    "text": "Extends the authorization of appropriations to fiscal year: (1) 1985 to assist States in constructing facilities for providing veterans with domiciliary care, nursing home care, and for the alteration and expansion of existing structures for providing such care in State homes; and (2) 1984 for medical information pilot programs. Prohibits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs from entering into any agreement for providing any assistance to health manpower training programs, to Veterans Administration - affiliated medical schools, or to establish new State medical schools, after December 31, 1979. Authorizes appropriations for such medical schools and training programs for each succeeding fiscal year (presently authorized for each of the six succeeding fiscal years). Eliminates a requirement for grants to affiliated medical schools and to health manpower training institutions that a proposed project will substantially increase the number of students at such medical school or training institution."
