Specifies that the purchase price of the new residence may not be more than $100,000 less than the adjusted sales price of the old residence. Extends from 18 to 30 months the period (rollover period) during which a taxpayer must reinvest the proceeds from the sale of a residence in a new residence in order to qualify for the nonrecognition of gain from any such sale. Allows individual taxpayers an income tax deduction of up to $4,000 annually and $20,000 in a lifetime for cash contributions to an individual housing account established to finance the purchase of a principal residence for the taxpayer. Limits the allowable amount of the income tax deduction for interest paid on home mortgages to $150,000."
