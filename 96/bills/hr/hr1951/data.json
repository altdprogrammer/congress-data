Entitles any candidate in a general or special election for Federal office to mail as third class mail any campaign mail and at rates applicable to bulk mail for qualified nonprofit organizations. Sets forth criteria and requirements for any such mailing. Authorizes appropriations to the U.S. Postal Service equal to the difference between revenues which would have been received if reduced rates under this Act were not permitted and estimated revenues to be received on mail carried under this Act. Repeals the provisions of this Act at the end of fiscal year 1979."
