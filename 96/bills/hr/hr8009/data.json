    "text": "Omnibus Antiterrorism Act of 1980 - Title I: International Terrorism - Directs the President to submit annual reports to Congress concerning: (1) state support of international terrorism, including a list of countries currently supporting international terrorism; and (2) acts of international terrorism which affected U.S. citizens, interests, or property. Specifies the sanctions to be imposed against such countries. Urges the President to seek international agreements to assure cooperation in combating terrorism. Lists provisions which should be given priority in negotiating such agreements. Title II: Aviation Security - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Secretary of Transportation to assess the effectiveness of security measures maintained at foreign airports and report such assessments to Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to restrict operations at those foreign airports failing to bring their security measures to the specified level of effectiveness. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical aviation security assistance to foreign governments. Extends the provisions requiring weapons detection screening for all passenger operations (currently required for all scheduled passenger operations). Amends provisions of the Federal criminal code that specify prohibited acts regarding the destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities to, among other revisions, set forth penalties for committing violence against a passenger which is likely to endanger an aircraft in service, and for communicating false information which results in endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight. Sets forth penalties for a person found in the United States who has committed against or aboard a foreign aircraft an offense in violation of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation. Authorizes civil penalties for carrying an accessible weapon aboard an aircraft and for imparting or conveying information known to be false regarding specified crimes aboard an aircraft. Specifies criminal penalties for threatening to commit air piracy or any other of certain crimes aboard an aircraft or for placing or attempting to place a loaded firearm aboard an aircraft in baggage which is not accessible to in-flight passengers. Title III: Explosive Taggants - Amends provisions relating to the manufacture of explosive materials to require such manufacturers to add an identification taggant and a detection taggant to the explosive materials. Prohibits the distribution, importation, or sale of explosive materials without such taggants. Exempts explosives used by Federal agencies for national defense or security purposes and black, smokeless propellant powders from such tagging requirements. Title IV: Assistance for Victims of Terrorism - Directs the Secretary of State to recommend ways in which the United States can assist in making services available to survivors of terrorist incidents and their families. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a task force for U.S. victims of terrorism to establish guidelines for meeting the needs of such victims. Title V: Federal Preparedness to Reduce the Effects of Terrorist Acts - Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to: (1) coordinate Federal planning to reduce the consequences of terrorist acts that would result in major disruptions in the United States; and (2) recommend to the President ways to reduce the effects of terrorist acts."
