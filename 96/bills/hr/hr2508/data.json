    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-02-28", 
    "text": "Regional Energy Development Act of 1979 - Chapter I: Introductory - Declares that energy shortages and the high cost of energy have created economic hardships in the Northeastern States, which would especially benefit from regional cooperation with the United States through an entity capable of financing and otherwise promoting increased energy supply and energy conservation. Defines \"Northeastern States\" as Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Chapter II: Organization, Management, Powers - Authorizes the creation of a corporation for profit, not an agency or establishment of the United States, to be known as the Energy Corporation of the Northeast. Directs the President to appoint incorporators who reside in the Northeastern States to serve as the initial Board of Directors of the Corporation, and to take whatever actions are necessary to establish the Corporation. Stipulates that a Northeastern State shall become a member of the Corporation when such State subscribes for State stock, contributes initial capital in the amount of $1 per capita, and enacts supporting legislation. Allows the Corporation to become operational if at least three States become members before December 31, 1978. Authorizes States that are contiguous to members to join the Corporation in the same manner. Authorizes the Corporation to participate in joint ventures with public or private groups and to operate through subsidiaries. Requires the Corporation to submit annual reports and audits to the President, Congress, Governors and legislatures of Member States. Directs the Governors, on a rotating basis, to designate independent persons to evaluate the performance of the Corporation every two years. Chapter III: Projects and Programs of the Corporation - Authorizes the Corporation to participate in financing any project related to solving the energy needs of the Northeast. Allows the Corporation to assist projects by loans, guarantees, or equity investments. Stipulates that before any financial assistance is provided, the Board of Directors of the Corporation must find that: (1) the project is expected to have a beneficial impact on the energy problems of the region; (2) the investment together with other Corporation activities will not materially impair the credit of the Corporation; (3) private capital is unavailable or insufficient; and (4) unless this limitation is specially waived, the Corporation will not operate the project on a continuing basis or invest more than 50 percent of the total cost. Authorizes rejection of each project by the Governor of the Member State in which it is located. Charges the Board with reviewing periodically the allocation of Corporation resources among the Member States to assure a measure of equity in the distribution of benefits. Limits the Corporation's investment in any one project to the greater of ten percent of its borrowing authority or $200,000,000. Chapter IV: Financing - Stipulates that capital subscriptions from the States ($1 per capita initial contribution) and private investors shall determine the borrowing authority of the Corporation according to a formula of $15 borrowing backed by Federal guarantees for each $1 capital contribution. Authorizes the contribution of additional capital by the States after the initial subscription. Authorizes the issuance of capital securities to States and private investors in a form determined by the Board. Permits the Corporation to issue its own obligations which shall be general obligations payable out of any revenues. Prohibits the Corporation from pledging the credit of the United States or the credit of Member States. Chapter V: Guarantee of Obligations - Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to guarantee obligations of the Corporation. Stipulates that such obligations are not tax exempt. Prohibits purchase of such obligations by the United States. Establishes an administrative expense fund in the U.S. Treasury to provide for the administrative expense payments with respect to guaranteed obligations. Chapter VI: State Legislation - Requires Member States, upon joining the Corporation, to enact legislation: (1) assuring decisions within 90 days of application on request for permits required for Corporation projects; (2) exempting the property, income, and operations of the Corporation from State and local taxation; and (3) specifying that insofar as the provisions of any State, general, special, or local law may be inconsistent with this Act, the provisions of this Act and the legislation enacted under this Chapter are controlling. Chapter VII: Miscellaneous - Specifies terms of construction and separability of the provisions of this Act."
