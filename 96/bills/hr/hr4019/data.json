    "text": "Nuclear Waste Management Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to make a preliminary determination concerning: (1) the location of a site to serve as a Federal demonstration repository for nuclear waste; (2) the techniques and methods to be used for the design, construction, and operation of such facility; (3) the procedures for transporting such wastes to the facility; and (4) the appropriate actions necessary to assure protection of the public health and safety and of the environment. Requires that any site recommended by the Secretary comport with recommendations made by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to the maximum extent possible. Requires the Secretary to select a site for such Federal nuclear waste repository by June 30, 1980, and to arrange for the construction and operation of such facility on such site by September 30, 1988. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress a detailed construction schedule for such facility, including the completion dates of required environmental impact statements and issuance dates of work authorization permits. Directs the Secretary to file with the NRC a license application for the facility and requires the NRC to act on such application within two years of the application submittal. Directs the Secretary to file a license application with the NRC for the receipt and disposal of nuclear wastes. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress annual status reports on the progress of the facility until operation begins. Directs the Secretary to hold public hearings and submit a comprehensive report to Congress, if the Secretary determines that circumstances exist which may impede the construction of such repository. Authorizes the Secretary to provide funds by contract for any research, development, and construction activities necessary to carry out the duties under the Act. Stipulates that the Secretary need not comply with specified bid advertising requirements with respect to such contracts. Permits the Secretary to enter into agreements with other persons relating to the transfer of nuclear wastes from civilian nuclear power plants licensed under the Atomic Energy Act to the Federal facility. Provides that user fees be established pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Requires that any materials transferred to the Federal facility be in a form suitable for storage, as determined by regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress annual reports of all agreements entered into relating to the transfer of nuclear waste. Provides that all such records, reports, or information obtained by the Secretary be made available to the public, except where either a showing is made that some portion is entitled to protection as trade secrets or the Secretary determines that the confidentiality of information is required as a matter of national security. Permits disclosure of information which may constitute either trade secrets or matters of national security to officers, employees, or authorized representatives of the U.S. concerned with carrying out this Act or involved in proceedings under this Act. Prohibits withholding of any such information from any duly-authorized congressional committee. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to Congress on: (1) the effects of Federal routing requirements for barge, rail, and highway shipment of nuclear wastes; and (2) the methods needed to insure State participation in the transportation planning process. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate standards and criteria for exposure to radiation from activities involved in the permanent storage and disposal of nuclear wastes. Requires that such standards be published in the Federal Register for public comment. Directs the Administrator to submit an assessment of public health and safety aspects of such activities to the NRC. Establishes the Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee to study and advise the Secretary on matters concerning: (1) the scope, pace, costs, and benefits of research and development of nuclear waste disposal technology; (2) the existing and prospective Federal policies and programs affecting development of such technology; (3) research, development, and demonstration activities relating to the construction and operation of a Federal demonstration repository; (4) means to insure effective participation by State and local authorities, relevant segments of the economy, the scientific and technical community, and the public in the research, development, siting, planning, construction, and operation of a Federal demonstration repository; and (5) any other action taken by the Secretary in carrying out the duties under the Act. Directs heads of Federal agencies to cooperate with the Committee and to furnish any information deemed necessary to carry out its duties under the Act. Directs the Secretary to seek advice from State and local governments, public and private organizations, and industry with respect to such technologies. Requires the Secretary to advise the Governor of any State designated as containing a potential site for construction of the Federal facility, to review and consider any materials or recommendations submitted by the Governor of such State and to notify the Governor of the State finally selected for the construction of the Federal facility. Directs the Secretary to not carry out duties under this Act in the event of such a formal recommendation from the Governor unless he resolves the matter with the Governor or finds that the construction of a repository at the designated site is consistent with the public health and welfare and will further the public interest. Affords that State or its representative the opportunity to participate in any NRC licensing proceeding and allows the State legislature to submit materials to be included in NRC's environmental impact statement."
