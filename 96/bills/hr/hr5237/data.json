    "text": "Fuel Stamp Act of 1979 - Establishes a fuel stamp program to assist participants in the food stamp program to pay the cost of fuel consumed for residential heating during the period of December through March. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to administer such program. Sets the monthly value of such fuel stamps to an eligible household at the cost of fuel consumed by such household up to a maximum of $75. Limits the use of such fuel stamps to payment for fuel consumed by a household to heat its residence. Requires payment to and acceptance by any person who sells such fuel to such household. Prescribes criminal penalties for the violation of such requirements. Limits redemption of fuel stamps to persons who sell fuel. Directs the Secretary to prescribe for the printing and inventory control of fuel stamps. Requires every State agency administering the food stamp program to submit for the Secretary's approval a plan of operation, containing specified general provisions, for conducting the fuel stamp program. Authorizes the Secretary to pay up to 50 percent of a State plan's administrative costs, and up to 75 percent of the cost of its investigations and prosecutions. Authorizes payment of a bonus for agencies with a less than five percent error rate. States that the value of any fuel stamp shall not be considered income or a resource under any Federal, State, or local law. Prohibits the reduction of State or local assistance to a household because of the receipt of fuel stamps. Prescribes criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to prohibit, in the calculation of household income, the consideration of the value of any fuel stamp as a household expenditure for shelter."
