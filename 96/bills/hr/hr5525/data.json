    "text": "Federal Property and Administrative Services Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to require each Federal agency, in acquiring personal property or nonpersonal services, to: (1) request a statement of the price of such property or services from each supplier submitting a proposal; and (2) select the lowest price offered. Extends specified provisions of such Act governing the management of property of executive agencies to govern property management for all Federal agencies. Requires the Secretary of Defense to obtain the consent of the Administrator of General Services (Administrator) in order to exempt the Department of Defense from specified provisions of such Act. Declares that procurement policies and methods prescribed by the Administrator pursuant to such Act are binding on all Federal agencies. Requires Federal agencies to acquire all personal property and nonpersonal services through the Administrator. Directs any agency currently exempted from such Act to seek an exemption from amendments made by this Act from the Administrator if the head of such an agency believes such amendments adversely affect the agency's authority. Authorizes the Administrator to review the procurement policies of Federal agencies. Authorizes the Administrator to utilize multiple award schedules in the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services under certain conditions. Directs contractors seeking awards under such a schedule to certify the accuracy of all price and cost data required to be submitted. Requires any contract awarded under a multiple schedule program to provide that: (1) the price to the Government shall be adjusted to exclude any cost increased because of inaccurate data; and (2) the Government may elect to cancel, without liability, any uncompleted portion of the contract. Authorizes the Administrator, upon determining that a contractor knew or should have known that any submitted data was inaccurate, to debar such contractor from participating in Government contracts for three years. Requires the Administrator to establish procedures affording contractors adequate notice and an opportunity for a hearing with respect to any proposed debarment. Permits the Administrator to order a temporary debarment pending such a hearing if such action is necessary to protect public interests."
