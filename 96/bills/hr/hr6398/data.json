    "text": "Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1980 - Title I: Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish and revise within one year safety rules and regulations to assure that: (1) commercial motor vehicles are safely maintained, equipped, loaded, and operated; (2) the responsibilities imposed upon drivers of such vehicles do not impair a driver's ability to operate such vehicle safely; (3) the physical condition of such drivers will be adequate to enable them to drive safely; and (4) the operation of such vehicles does not create deleterious effects on the physical condition of such drivers. Permits the Secretary to waive such rules and regulations if to do so is in the public interest and consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. Directs the Secretary and the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor to undertake, and submit to Congress within one year a study of health hazards to which operators of commercial vehicles are exposed. Requires the development of such materials and information as are necessary to enable such employees to carry out their employment free from recognized hazards capable of causing serious injury. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct research, development, demonstration, and training activities to develop such rules and regulations, to design and develop improved enforcement procedures and technologies, and to familiarize affected persons with such regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to require persons subject to this Act to maintain such records and make such reports as are necessary to insure compliance with this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct investigations and inspections without notice to enforce this Act. Requires the Secretary to timely investigate nonfrivolous complaints alleging a material violation of any rule or regulation issued under this Act. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for such violations. Provides for judicial review of final orders with respect to such alleged violations. Prohibits an employer from discriminating or taking punitive actions against employees who complain of safety violations, who participate in any proceeding regarding such alleged violations, or who refuse to operate a vehicle when to do so would materially violate motor carrier safety violations. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for up to 80 percent of the costs of the development or implementation of programs for the enforcement of commercial motor vehicle safety regulations. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for fiscal years 1981, 1982 and 1983. Requires States which agree to enforce this Act to submit an enforcement plan to the Secretary for approval. Sets forth requirements which must be included in any such plan. Permits any State agency to adopt additional or more stringent rules and regulations which are consistent with the Federal rules and regulations. Permits any State to retain existing hours-of-service regulations except where such regulations diminish commercial motor vehicle safety or are unduly burdensome on interstate commerce. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to the Congress regarding current plans to upgrade the safety and health of operators of commercial motor vehicles. Directs the Secretary to submit a report to Congress within 12 months regarding the advisability of establishing a national commercial vehicle driver register to upgrade safety through improved monitoring of traffic accidents and violations and of multiple State licensing. Exempts vehicles engaged in farming or logging operations from the requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Advisory Committee to review research projects and proposed regulations, make recommendations and advise the Secretary on matters relating to the activities and functions of the Department in the field of commercial motor vehicle safety. States that membership on such Committee shall be appointed by the Secretary."
