    "text": "Nitrite Moratorium and Food Safety Act - Prohibits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Secretary of Agriculture from prohibiting commerce, prior to May 1, 1980, in any food by reason of the carcinogenic or other toxic effect of the nitrite added to that food, if: (1) addition of such nitrite was permitted under applicable Federal Act on May 1, 1979; and (2) the quantity of such nitrite is within the tolerances in effect on May 1, 1979, or within such tolerances as may thereafter be established, for the purpose of preventing botulism. Prohibits either Secretary from prohibiting commerce on or after May 1, 1980, in any food to which nitrite has been added if the addition of such nitrite: (1) is shown to be safe; or (2) if not shown to be safe, is shown to be necessary to protect against botulism. Extends the period of such moratorium until such time as an alternative anti-toxin becomes available. Requires each Secretary to make an annual review of all regulations issued under this Act in order to determine progress toward making available effective and feasible alternative means for preventing botulism."
