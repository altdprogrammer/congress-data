    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income tax credit for individuals who perform voluntary services for public service organizations. Allows a credit equal to the greater of $2.90 for each hour of volunteer service or the minimum hourly wage which would apply for such service under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Limits the amount of such credit to $750 for a taxable year. Requires a volunteer to perform at least 50 hours of volunteer service in order to qualify for any credit. Defines \"public service organizations\" as organizations which are: (1) tax exempt charitable organizations or civic leagues; (2) public safety service organizations (including police, firefighting, ambulance, or civil defense service organizations); or (3) nonpartisan social welfare organizations which seek the advancement of human welfare through electoral or legislative reforms."
