    "text": "National Soil Conservation Act of 1980 - Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and implement a program for the conservation of soil, water, and related resources by providing technical and financial assistance to owners and operators of non-Federal agricultural land. Limits assistance to those lands which are an integral part of a private farm operating unit and are under the control of the private landowners or operators. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into conservation agreements and contracts with such owners and operators. Establishes minimum conservation performance standards in such agreements. Requires landowners and operators to agree to forfeit all rights to any benefit under such contracts if such owner or operator fails to certify to the Secretary his or her compliance with such minimum standards. Directs the Secretary to determine the maximum amount of cost-share assistance that may be provided to any single recipient. Permits the Secretary to terminate or modify any contract by mutual agreement if to do so would be in the public interest. Directs the Secretary to formulate and implement a pilot program to test and demonstrate the effectiveness of achieving conservation of such resources through contracts where the Secretary would pay such owners and operators for amounts of resources saved. Sets forth the requirements for such program including conservation plans and agreements which require resource evaluations and estimates and the use of conservation measures and management techniques. Directs the Secretary to determine the amount of payments to be made based upon an annual report by a qualified conservationist. Requires such program to operate for five years. Limits the amount of payments which may be made to any one landowner or operator. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the progress of such pilot program. Directs the Secretary to protect participants from disqualification or penalty under other agricultural programs."
