Specifies that no site shall be subject to any restrictions as a consequence of listing on the National Register of Historic Places except in cases in which the owner of such site is compensated pursuant to this Act. Permits the Federal government to bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States to list a site on the National Register of Historic Places. Specifies that when any site is listed through such court the Federal government must pay compensation for the listing to each owner of record, except in cases in which the deduction allowed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 adequately compensates such owner."
