    "text": "Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require the financing of disability insurance benefits from general revenues, rather than through the imposition of employment and self-employment taxes. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce employment and self-employment tax rates below the level established by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 for purposes of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance program and the Hospital Insurance program. Requires deductions from disability benefits based on family income to be made on the same basis that such deductions are made from old-age and survivors benefits. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish within the Social Security Administration an Office of Training to provide specialized training for State and Federal officials required to make determinations of disability. Requires that such officials be certified by the Secretary as having successfully completed such training before engaging in making disability determinations. Entitles an individual whose disability claim has been rejected or partially disallowed to a personal interview with the examiner making the determination. Directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register regulations defining physical and mental impairments which would qualify an individual for disability benefits."
