    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Act providing for the location of foreign government and international organization offices within a specified area in the District of Columbia to authorize the Secretary of State to develop in coordination with the Administrator of General Services (GSA) or to exchange, as well as sell or lease, property in such area for such purpose. Increases the specified area available for such purpose. Designates such Act as the International Center Act. Repeals provisions regarding a headquarters building for the Organization of American States within such area. Authorizes the GSA to design, construct and equip a headquarters building, legation building, or related facilities, on property within such area, if so requested by any foreign government or international organization. Exempts such buildings from the District of Columbia zoning regulations, effective January 1, 1980. Requires any such buildings constructed in such area to be subject to the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission. Includes demolition or removal of existing structures and site preparation within the services to be provided by the Secretary, GSA, and the D.C. government within or contiguous to such area. Includes such services for other utilities and related improvements within such authority. Permits the Secretary, until September 30, 1982, to retain a reserve for maintenance and security of public improvements and for development plans of additional areas for chancery or diplomatic purposes out of the proceeds from the sale, exchange, or lease of such property to foreign governments or international organizations."
