Requires, in the case of cards issued to aliens who are not in the United States under conditions which make it lawful for them to engage in employment, that such card be marked to indicate that such individual may not be legally employed. Authorizes the reissuance of such card without such mark at such time as it is determined that the alien may lawfully engage in employment in the United States. Establishes criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly employ alien holders of cards which indicate that they may not lawfully engage in employment in the United States."
