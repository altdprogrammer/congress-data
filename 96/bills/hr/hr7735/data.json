    "text": "Amends the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 to prohibit State limitations on interest or other charges with regard to the extension of consumer credit. Permits States to adopt legislation explicitly exempting themselves from such prohibition. Permits creditors to impose transaction fees and access fees pursuant to an open-end credit plan. Prohibits any State limitation on charges in connection with such plans based on whether the creditor imposes such fees. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to exclude access fees and transaction fees from computation of the finance charges with respect to open-end credit plans. Amends the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 to declare that extensions of consumer credit may be made at the highest applicable rate if one or more statutory provisions apply with respect to the same extension of consumer credit."
