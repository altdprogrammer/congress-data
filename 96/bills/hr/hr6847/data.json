    "text": "Amends the Animal Welfare Act to require any research facility using live animals for research, testing, teaching, or for the production of medical or veterinary products to utilize certain methods of research and testing which minimize the pain inflicted upon such animals. Defines pain for the purposes of the Act to mean not only hurtful immediate physical sensations but also debilitation and significant physical and behavioral distress. Includes within the humane standards for animals transported in commerce the requirement that such animals be provided with space for normal exercise. Permits elementary and secondary schools to keep live animals for observational studies not involving pain without registering with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (formerly the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare) provided that they are kept under humane conditions. Requires research facilities to establish and maintain animal care committees which shall be responsible for the care and use of such animals in accordance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to appoint an advisory committee on the humane treatment of laboratory animals. Subjects research facilities to criminal penalties for violations of the Animal Welfare Act."
