Permits a standard mileage rate of 30 cents per mile for automobile travel expenses, plus expenses incurred for tolls, parking fees, and similar expenses. Defines \"meal expenses\" as amounts paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year for the cost of meals consumed by the taxpayer while away from his residence in pursuit of a trade or business. Limits the amount of such meals to $25 per day."
