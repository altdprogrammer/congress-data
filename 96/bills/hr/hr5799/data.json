    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-11-02", 
    "text": "Federal Personnel and Personal Services Contract Management Act - Prohibits the total number of civilian employees in the executive branch in any fiscal year from exceeding the number of such employees on September 30, 1977. Requires the President to publish in the Federal Register any finding that an increase in such personnel ceiling would service the public interest. Prohibits the amount expended by all executive agencies for personal service contracts during any fiscal year from exceeding the total amount expended by all agencies during fiscal year 1977. Authorizes the President to increase such amount, not to exceed a specified limit, upon publishing a finding that: (1) such increase serves the public interest; (2) an increase is necessary to assure the good administration of the agency; and (3) the contracts involved are not being used to circumvent any personnel ceiling. Precludes an agency from obligating or expending more than 20 percent of the total funds provided to the agency by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for such contracts during the last two months of a fiscal year. Declares that no such contract ceiling shall apply during a time of war or a period of national emergency. Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to submit to Congress annual reports concerning the administration of personnel ceilings and agency contracts for personal services. Requires that such report on contracts specify the number of Federal employees who were separated from the civil service during any period in which a contract for personal services similar to the services performed by such an employee was in effect. Directs the OPM to submit to each House of Congress an annual report which: (1) describes the utilization of temporary employees in each agency during the fiscal year; and (2) recommends ways to enforce personnel ceilings for such employees. Requires the OMB to establish a personnel ceiling and a contract ceiling for each executive agency. Terminates the provisions of this Act on January 31, 1985. Requires certain individuals receiving compensation under personnel service contracts to file financial disclosure reports with the contracting agency. Directs the OPM to implement a system providing annual cash awards to employees for outstanding service, emphasizing responsiveness to public needs at the local level. States that only members of the public may nominate candidates for such awards. Directs an agency to consider performance in administering personnel and contract ceilings and in following contracting procedures when evaluating the performance of senior executives and managers."
