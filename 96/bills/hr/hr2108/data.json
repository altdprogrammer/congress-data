    "text": "Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1979 - Title I: Criminal Justice Assistance - Restates and amends in its entirety title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Law Enforcement Assistance). Replaces the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration within the Department of Justice with a Bureau of Criminal Justice Assistance. Establishes within the Bureau (1) the Office of the Community Anticrime Program, and (2) the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Establishes within the Department and independent of the Bureau two separate bodies: (1) the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), and (2) the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). Establishes Policy Boards to the NIJ and the BJS, and directs each Board to review and make recommendations with respect to the activities undertaken by their respective bodies. Restructures the existing program of grants and assistance to State and local units of government into three categories: formula grants, special emphasis grants, and transition grants. Sets forth the purposes for which such grants may be made and the procedures to be followed in making the grants. Repeals titles I and II of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Title II: Public Safety Officers' Death Benefits - Continues the existing program of public safety officers' death benefits, but transfers its administration to the Secretary of Labor. Title III: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective on October 1, 1979."
