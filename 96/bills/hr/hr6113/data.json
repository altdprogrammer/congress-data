    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-12-12", 
    "text": "Amends the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930, to include in the definition of \"dealer\" any person engaged in the business of packing in wholesale or jobbing quantities any perishable agricultural commodity in interstate or foreign commerce. Excludes from such definition: (1) any producer who raises a commodity and does not engage in the packing of such commodity in containers with specified descriptive markings; and (2) buyers of potatoes for canning and/or processing within the State where grown. Lowers from $200,000 to $100,000 the amount of the invoice cost of purchases of perishable agricultural commodities in any calendar year which a retailer may spend without being considered a \"dealer\". Requires that specified misrepresentations be knowing or negligent in order to be unlawful under this Act. Declares unlawful specified unwitting misrepresentations. Includes the assignees of the claims of nonresidents among those complainants required to furnish a bond in a specified amount before formal action is taken on their complaints under such Act. Terminates the authority of the Secretary to waive the furnishing of such bonds by complainants who are residents of countries which permit the filing of complaints by U.S. residents without the furnishing of a bond. Authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil fine for specified unwitting misrepresentations under such Act."
