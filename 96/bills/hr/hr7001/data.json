Requires that such banks receive certificates of membership which shall be retired upon termination of a bank's status as a member. Prohibits for the retirement of existing stock subscriptions over a five-year period consistent with the operation of the Federal budget and monetary control policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Title II: Structural Changes in the Federal Reserve System - Eliminates the Federal Open Market Committee and places authority for the conduct of open-market operations in the Board of Governors. Requires the president of each Federal Reserve district to be the district's member on the Federal Advisory Council. Requires that each president be a bona fide resident of the district involved. Repeals the requirement that appointments to the Federal Advisory Council be approved by the Board of Governors. Directs the Federal Reserve System to conduct its affairs to foster the policies of the Employment Act of 1946 and the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, particularly those relating to a stable price level and on improved national economic structure. Title III: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective dates of the provisions of this Act."
