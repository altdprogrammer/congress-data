    "text": "Sugar Act of 1979 - Title I: International Sugar Agreement - Authorizes the President to implement the International Sugar Agreement by: (1) regulating the entry of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization; and (2) requiring records and reports concerning the entry of sugar. Title II: Domestic Sugar Program - Establishes 15.75 cents per pound, raw value, as the price objective for domestic sugar during the 1979 sugar supply year. Sets forth the formula for adjusting the price objective for succeeding years. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor the average daily price of sugar imports. Directs the Secretary to recommend that the President impose special import duties on sugar and sugar-containing products to assure that the average daily price of sugar imports will meet the proclaimed price objective for sugar. Requires the Secretary to review the imposed duties and recommend any adjustments to the President. Authorizes the President to impose special import duties after receiving any recommendation of the Secretary within certain time limitations. Requires the President to request an investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission to determine whether the entry of sugar-containing products is adversely affecting the achievement of the price objective before imposing any special import duty on such products. Requires the Secretary to make payments to producers and processors when the price objective is not achieved through the special import duties. Sets forth the formula for determining the amount of payments. Authorizes the imposition of quotas on the entry of sugar when the producer return objective cannot be achieved by special import duties and payments to producers. Requires frequent review of such quotas. Exempts certain sugar or sugar-containing products from this title. Specifies that certain sugar entered for subsequent export shall not be charged against any proclaimed quota. Authorizes the President to suspend the operation of this title in a national emergency. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to permit the President to proclaim special import duties and quotas on sugars, syrups, and molasses in order to carry out this Act. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Vests jurisdiction for enforcing this Act in U.S. district courts. Requires all persons engaged in manufacturing, marketing, transporting, or industrial use of sugar and other sweeteners to furnish the Secretary with necessary information. Prohibits officials engaged in the administration of this Act from investing or speculating in sugar. Establishes penalties for violating these regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct surveys and investigations to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies on the costs of producing various sugar and sweetener products. Authorizes the Secretary to waive part of the interest and/or principal to encourage repayment of Commodity Credit Corporation loans with respect to the 1977 and 1978 crops of sugar beets and sugarcane. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act to exempt sugar from the 50 percent ad valorem limitation on duties."
