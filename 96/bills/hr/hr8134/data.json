Directs the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture to administer a protected agricultural river in a manner consistent with the agricultural cultivation and grazing practices which have contributed to the natural character of such river, unless such practices present a clear hazard to safety or health. Directs the President to make recommendations and proposals to Congress on the designation of rivers as protected agricultural rivers."
