    "text": "International Human Rights Policy Act of 1979 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to deny development assistance to any country which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of those human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, unless the Administrator of this Act certifies to the Congress and the Congress adopts a concurrent resolution approving such certification that such assistance will directly benefit the needy people in that country. Requires congressional approval of the President's certification that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting the provision of security assistance to a government despite such governments practice of engaging in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. Directs the President, with the assistance of the Secretary of State, to respond to requests from the Congress setting forth information as to a designated country's observance of and respect for human rights and whether, notwithstanding human rights violations, the President believes extraordinary circumstances necessitate the continuation of security assistance to such country. Makes such amendments applicable to any licenses in effect with respect to the export of defense articles or defense services under the Arms Export Act. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to prohibit agreements for financing the sale of agricultural commodities with countries violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, unless the Congress approves the President's submission of information that such agreement will directly benefit the needy people in the country involved. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act to permit the Export-Import Bank to deny applications for credit for violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support a project, despite a country's human rights violations, if: (1) the President determines that national security interests so require; and (2) Congress approves such determination. Amends the Act which provides for increased U.S. participation in specified international financial institutions to repeal the requirements that Executive Directors of such institutions consider specific actions by the executive branch or Congress on individual bilateral assistance programs because of human rights considerations. Requires U.S. Executive Directors to oppose loans or other assistance to countries to which U.S. foreign assistance has been terminated on account of human rights violations."
