    "text": "Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to exclude the judicial branch of the Federal Government from coverage under such Act which prohibits discriminatory practices in personnel actions affecting specified employees and applicants in units having positions in the competitive service. Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to exercise specified authorities (otherwise granted to the Civil Service Commission) including the enforcement of discrimination prohibitions through appropriate remedies and the review of equal opportunity programs with respect to employment in any unit of the legislative branch of the Federal Government (except the Library of Congress). Amends the National Labor Relations Act to include the United States, and any unit of the legislative branch of the United States, in the definition of \"employer\" for purposes of such Act. Declares that provisions of such Act relating to the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively shall not be construed to limit the application of specified loyalty and no-strike requirements for Federal and District of Columbia government employees. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to include in the definition of \"employee\" for purposes of such Act any individual employed by the U.S. Government in any unit of the legislative branch of the Government. Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to include the United States and any unit of the legislative branch of the United States in specified definitions of \"employer\" for purposes of such Act. Includes any authority of the Congress in the definition of \"agency\" for specified public information purposes (Freedom of Information Act). Amends the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to include service performed as the Vice President of the United States, as a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner of or to the Congress, or in the legislative branch within the definitions of employment for purposes of such Acts relating, respectively, to Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits and to Federal Insurance Contributions (applicable to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1979)."
