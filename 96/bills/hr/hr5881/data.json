Limits the total amount of such credit to five percent of the taxable business income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. Exempts such reserve fund from income taxation. Allows an income tax deduction for the basic research expenses paid out of the reserve fund during the taxable year. Specifies that research financed pursuant to this Act shall be performed by an institution of higher education, and that the results of such research must be made public not later than one year after such research is made available to the taxpayer."
