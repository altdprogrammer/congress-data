Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to remove the existing 70-year upper age limit to which the prohibitions of such Act apply, thereby extending the protection of such Act to all individuals who are at least 40 years of age. Requires that an examination of the effect of such removal of the upper age limit be included in a specified study by the Secretary of Labor."
