    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-04-09", 
    "text": "Solar Energy Employment and Training Act - Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA) to authorize the Secretary of Labor to provide financial assistance to certain CETA prime sponsors and other private nonprofit or public agencies, including community-based organizations, unions, and vocational education facilities, to provide employment and training programs in the fields of solar energy and energy conservation for persons who are: (1) unemployed or underemployed; or (2) in school and are ages 16 to 24, inclusive. Directs the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to promulgate guidelines for such programs. Allows Governors or prime sponsors, in order to carry out such programs and after consultation with community-based organizations and nonprofit groups, to: (1) enter into contracts with project applicants or employers organized for profit (with limitations on payments to such employers); or (2) operate such programs directly. Requires the Secretary, in awarding financial assistance under the provisions of this Act, to assure that: (1) each geographical section of the country is awarded a project; (2) sufficient natural resources and technology are available to ensure a successful project; and (3) areas which are poor in conventional energy sources are awarded financial assistance. Directs the Secretary to use up to 20 percent of such funds to support certain apprenticeship projects, including those in the solar and energy conservation aspects of traditional building trades and new trades. Authorizes appropriations for such programs for fiscal years 1980 through 1984. Limits to 25 percent the amount of such funds which may be used for administrative and other allowable costs incurred by groups conducting such projects. Directs the Secretary to arrange for the implementation of solar energy and energy conservation education and training programs in suitable Job Corps centers."
