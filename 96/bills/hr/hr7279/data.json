    "text": "Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Act which provides for the establishment of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in the State of Ohio to permit the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a lease providing for the continued use by an individual of land within the recreation area which is acquired for the purposes of such Act, if, immediately before its acquisition: (1) a mobile home was located on such land; (2) such mobile home was owned by an individual and occupied by him as a principal place of residence; and (3) such land was owned by a person other than the owner of the mobile home. Allows the Secretary to enter into a contract with any person to carry out such leasing and to manage the land subject to such leasing arrangements. Gives the person who, immediately prior to its acquisition by the Secretary, owned such land to be leased the right of first refusal to enter into such a contract. Allows such lease to be for any specified period of time acceptable to the lessee, but no longer than 25 years after the date of the Secretary's acquisition of such land. Permits any such lease to require the lessee to assume all or a portion of the cost of maintenance of the leased premises and the utility services associated with such premises. Requires the Secretary, in managing any such leased land, to take into account the views of the occupants of the mobile homes. Makes the owner-occupant of any mobile home located on land within the recreation area acquired by the Secretary, who elects to move to any dwelling outside the recreation area before the expiration of the ten year period beginning on the date of acquisition of such land, eligible for additional relocation payments under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Properties Acquisition Act of 1970. Authorizes the Secretary to assist and consult with the appropriate members or officers of the Cuyahoga Valley Park Community Council in establishing or coordinating zoning laws."
