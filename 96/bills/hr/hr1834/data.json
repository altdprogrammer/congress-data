    "text": "Act to Combat International Terrorism - Directs the President to report biannually to Congress regarding acts of international terrorism and to submit lists of countries supporting international terrorism. Specifies the sanctions to be imposed against such countries. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Secretary of Transportation to assess the effectiveness of security measures maintained at foreign airports and report such assessments to Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to restrict operations at those foreign airports failing to bring their security measures to a standard level of effectiveness. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical aviation security assistance to foreign governments. Amends the provisions of Federal law which relate to the manufacture of explosive materials to require such manufacturers to add an identification taggant and a detection taggant to the explosive materials. Prohibits the distribution, importation, or sale of explosive materials without such taggants. Specifies penalties for those manufacturers found violating such provisions. Exempts manufacturers of: (1) explosive materials which are to be used by the Federal Government for national security purposes; and (2) small quantities of black powder, from such provisions. Amends the provisions of title 18 of the U.S. Code that specify prohibited acts regarding the destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities to, among other revisions, set forth penalties for committing violence against a passenger which is likely to endanger an aircraft in service, and for communicating false information which results in endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight. Sets forth penalties for a person found in the United States who has committed against or aboard a foreign aircraft an offense in violation of the convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation. Authorizes civil penalties for carrying an accessible weapon aboard an aircraft and for imparting or conveying information known to be false regarding specified crimes aboard an aircraft. Specifies criminal penalties for threatening to commit air piracy or any other of certain crimes aboard an aircraft."
