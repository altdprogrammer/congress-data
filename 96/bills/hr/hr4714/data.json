Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service, to make grants to certain States enumerated in the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to develop marine artificial reefs in the territorial waters of such States and to develop such habitats in the fishery conservation zone off the coasts of such States. Requires each fishery management council established under the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to establish a fishery management plan for each habitat established under this Act in the Councils' region."
