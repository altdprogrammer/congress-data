Directs the Secretary of Energy to acquire and install wind energy systems in Federal facilities and authorizes the Secretary to issue necessary rules and regulations concerning site selection, maintenance and repair of such systems, and transfers of ownership to State or local governments. Directs the Secretary to establish a wind energy systems evaluation and purchase program to stimulate the early development of a permanent low-cost private wind energy systems production capability and stimulate the private sector market for such systems in the United States. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $500,000,000 for fiscal years 1980 through 1984 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
