    "text": "Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to prohibit the export of any agricultural commodity pursuant to an agricultural commodity export agreement unless the exporter has obtained an agricultural export license from the Secretary of Commerce. Prohibits approval of such license unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that: (1) there will be a sufficient domestic supply of the commodity for a 12-month period; (2) the proposed transaction will not increase consumer prices; and (3) the proposed transaction will not increase domestic unemployment. Exempts from this Act exports in a quantity for which the price is less than $10,000,000. Stipulates that such agreements, occurring within a 30-day period between the same parties and for the same commodity shall be considered a single agreement for purposes of this exemption."
