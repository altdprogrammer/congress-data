    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-05-24", 
    "text": "Reform of Federal Regulation Act of 1979 - Title I: The Analysis, Planning and Management of Regulatory Functions - Requires each Federal agency to publish for each proposed major rule, as such rule is defined in this Act, an initial regulatory analysis which describes the need for the rule, at least two available alternative approaches, and a description of the economic and social effects of the proposed rule and alternatives. Requires that each agency publish for each adopted major rule a final regulatory analysis which includes a summary of public comments received on the initial analysis, and a justification of the selection of the final rule. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to review and report to Congress on the agency actions to implement this Title. Directs each agency to: (1) report annually to Congress and the public on its regulatory agenda and priorities for the current fiscal year; and (2) include in the announcement of a rulemaking or adjudication the date by which the agency intends to complete such proceeding. Requires each agency to report annually to the Administrative Conference of the U.S., the Congress, and the public on its regulatory activities of the past fiscal year. Stipulates that such report include: (1) the number of agency proceedings which the agency failed to complete by the established deadline and the reasons for such failure; and (2) any changes the agency made to improve its regulatory actions. Directs each regulatory agency to establish an office to be responsible for regulatory planning and management. Requires any independent regulatory commission to submit any budget information or legislative recommendation to Congress concurrently upon submission to any officer or agency of the executive branch. Title II: Improving the Efficiency of Administrative Proceedings - Establishes a new procedure for administrative rulemaking and adjudication by United States Government agencies. States that such procedure shall apply to: (1) all adjudications; and (2) all rulemaking or licensing proceedings required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing except proceedings to withdraw, suspend, revoke, or annul a license. Provides two levels for the conduct of proceedings subject to this Act, a \"general hearing process\" and a \"formal hearing\" for the resolution of matters determined during the general hearing to involve general and substantial issues of fact which cannot be resolved at the general hearing and upon which the decision of the agency is likely to depend. Requires, for the general hearing process, the conduct of a hearing to afford parties an opportunity to submit written data, and, at the request of any party, an opportunity for oral argument. Enumerates the powers of the presiding employee at a general hearing. Authorizes such employee to cross- examine witnesses and to request the agency to consider and act on interlocutory appeals when action on such appeals would expedite final agency action. Directs the employee to: (1) oversee the expeditious completion of such hearing; and (2) provide a concise record of the important matters of the proceeding. States that no person who participates in the decision making of any proceeding or in a board or agency review of such decision may: (1) make ex parte communications; or (2) be responsible to or subject to the supervision of an employee or agent performing investigative or litigating functions for the agency. Allows an agency to prohibit an individual from appearing at a proceeding if the individual engages in unethical conduct or deliberate dilatory tactics. Authorizes an agency to subpoena any person or evidence as necessary. Sets forth the judicial procedure and civil penalty for persons who fail to comply with a subpoena. Requires each agency to maintain a public file of significant material concerning the major stages of a proceeding. Authorizes the presiding employee at a formal hearing to: (1) rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence; (2) require written testimony and arguments when oral testimony is not required; and (3) upon request, to issue a decision prior to completion of the hearing if there is no substantial dispute of fact. Authorizes each agency to establish employee boards to review the decisions of presiding employees. Directs each agency to specify the conditions under which it will accept an appeal of the decision of such a board, and specifies the conditions which enable an agency to review such a decision. Requires the Office of Personnel Management to test, register, and certify eligible candidates for the position of administrative law judge (hereinafter referred to as \"judge\"). Authorizes each agency to appoint a judge from the list of certified candidates. Directs the Administrator of the Administrative Conference of the U.S. to: (1) establish a performance appraisal system for evaluating judges at least once every ten years; and (2) establish performance and evaluation review boards to assist in setting up the appraisal system and in evaluating judges. Directs the Administrator to evaluate each judge before the expiration of the judge's ten-year term, and to make a recommendation on the reappointment of the judge. Requires each agency to reappoint a judge if the Administrator so recommends. Directs the Merit Systems Protection Board to remove, downgrade, or suspend a judge whose performance is found to be unacceptable. Provides for the transfer and reassignment of judges by the Administrator. Requires the President to nominate members of independent regulatory commissions by reason of their training and experience, and to appoint the chairman of each commission with the advice and consent of the Senate. Directs each agency to issue rules to implement this title within 150 days. Title III: Agency Review of Rules - Direct each agency to review annually one or more of its rules to determine whether continuation or amendment of the rule is in the public interest. Sets forth guidelines the agency should consider in selecting rules to review. Requires each agency to: (1) publish an agenda and the procedure for reviewing one or more rule every five years; (2) provide an opportunity for public comment on such rule; and (3) report the results of each review to Congress and the public. Requires the Director of the CBO to review the agency reports and oversee implementation of this Title. Title IV: Administrative Conference of the United States - Reorganizes the Administrative Conference. Makes the head of the Conference the Administrator who shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a four-year term. Grants the Administrator authority to appoint officers and employees and to prescribe their powers and duties as necessary. Sets forth the functions of the Conference which include: (1) studying and making recommendations on the adequacy of administrative procedures used by agencies to carry out regulatory functions; (2) monitoring agency compliance with such laws as the Freedom of Information Act and the Administrative Procedure Act; (3) compensating persons for the cost of participating in agency proceedings in certain cases; and (4) evaluating the performance of administrative law judges. Directs the Conference to submit an analysis of agency reports on regulatory activities to Congress, and to report to Congress on a study of providing incentives to participants to expedite agency proceedings. Establishes an Advisory Commission within the Conference."
