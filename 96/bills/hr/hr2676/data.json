Specifies amounts authorized for programs concerning air quality, water quality, drinking water, pesticides, solid waste, toxic substances, radiation, program management and support, noise control activities, interdisciplinary activities, and energy-related activities. Prohibits the transfer of funds, above a specified amount, without prior written approval by the appropriate Congressional committees or the lapse of 30 legislative days after the transmittal to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the President of the Senate of a written report containing a full and complete statement concerning the nature and reason of the transfer. Prohibits the transfer of energy-related environmental protection projects from EPA to the Department of Energy and prohibits actions taken through administrative or budgetary means to diminish EPA's ability to initiate such projects. Directs the Administrator to establish a separately identifiable long-term environmental research and development program to be funded by a percentage of funds appropriated under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for use by the National Bureau of Standards for research in the area of environmental measurement and for development of specifications for recovered materials. Requires the Administrator to make available to the appropriate Congressional committees all reports relevant to the agency's program of research, development, and demonstration. Authorizes the Administrator to allow outside groups or individuals to use special EPA research and test facilities and to receive reimbursement for such use."
