    "text": "Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to prohibit Federal officers or employees from refusing to issue or renew airman certificates or from requiring air carriers to terminate the employment of, or refuse to employ, airline pilots solely by the reason of the age of such person, if such person is less than 70 years of age. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, upon a determination that it is in the interests of safety, to require airline pilots over the age of 60 to pass more frequent or more comprehensive medical exams than pilots who are less than 60 years of age. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Health, in consultation with the Secretaries of Transportation and Labor, to review available medical data to determine whether an age limitation for aircraft pilots is medically warranted. Requires the Director to submit a report regarding such study to Congress by January 1, 1982."
