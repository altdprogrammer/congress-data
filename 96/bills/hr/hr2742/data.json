    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1979-10-29", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Act establishing the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore to dedicate such lakeshore to the memory of Paul H. Douglas. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to designate the West Beach unit as the \"Paul H. Douglas Ecological and Recreational Unit.\" Authorizes the design and construction of a structure, or the designation of an existing structure, to be known as the \"Paul H. Douglas Center for Environmental Education. Expands such Lakeshore to include 1,435 additional acres of land. Authorizes the Secretary to use appropriated funds for the acquisition of State or local school lands. Amends the provisions of such Act dealing with the qualifying dates for the retention of rights of occupancy for improved properties. Removes the maximum 20 year right of retained occupancy of improved residential property within the Lakeshore, and permits an owner, at his or her option, to select either a lifetime retained occupancy, or a fixed term occupancy of up to 25 years, not to extend beyond the specified date. Authorizes the Secretary to extend the term of currently existing reservations of use and occupancy of 20 years or less. Extends the life of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Advisory Commission. Increases the amount of the existing development ceiling for the Lakeshore, and increases the authorization of appropriations for land acquisition therein. Directs the Secretary to acquire only those interests sufficient to protect the natural resource values of a specified area of land if the owner should degrade or threaten to degrade the natural qualities of such area. Directs the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a plan to achieve and maintain the integrity of the lands in the vicinity of Cowles Bog and the Nipsco Greenbelt. Sets forth the components of such plan. States that if a judicial or administrative determination is made that the acquisition of any portion of certain specified lands has prevented or impaired the ability of the former owner to construct, operate or maintain the power generating facilities in operation or under construction as of the date of enactment of this Act, the utility operator will have the option to repurchase the necessary interest for the original amount paid by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to conduct a public access study of the Lakeshore, and thereafter to designate a principal public entrance for the west unit, as well as to acquire additional lands necessary for improved public access. Identifies a specific utility corridor running through a portion of the Lakeshore within which the Secretary is to acquire only a sufficient interest in order to ensure public access across the corridor."
