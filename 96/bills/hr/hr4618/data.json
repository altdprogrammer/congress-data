    "text": "Energy Technology and Planning Act of 1979 - Title I: Energy Technology and Planning - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to assure that policies and programs are established by the Federal Government, the States and the private sector to synchronize the production, distribution, and use of energy with research and technological development of new methods for energy production, distribution, consumption, and waste disposal. Declares further that such policies and programs be established with due regard for their effects upon the use of materials, upon the natural environment, and upon social institutions, values, and mores. Title II: National Energy Policy Plan - Directs the President to prepare and submit to the Congress a National Energy Policy Plan setting forth objectives, strategies, and contingency plans for the system of energy production, conservation, distribution, consumption, and waste disposal. Requires the President to consult with regional, State, and local governments, agencies, citizens, private businesses, and other groups and individuals in the formulation of such plan. Sets forth details of such plan and directs the President to recommend legislation and administrative actions necessary to achieve the purposes of such plan. Title III: Congressional Review - Directs each House of Congress to approve, disapprove, or amend such plan and allows the President to resubmit the proposed plan with modifications in the event of congressional disapproval. Title IV: Implementation - Directs the President to report to the Congress by July 1, 1980, on programs and organizational structures within the executive branch as he deems to be required to prepare such plan. States that such report shall include a program of energy research and development and legislative recommendations for establishing programs and structures for carrying out programs contained in such plan. Directs the President to recommend programs and methods of energy policy analysis designed to provide forecasts of unanticipated environmental, economic, social, and political effects of activities resulting from implementation of such plan. Directs the President to take appropriate actions to assure that Federal departments and agencies, State and local governments, independent agencies and the private sector carry out their programs in compliance with the objectives of such plan. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. Title V: Conforming Amendments - Amends the Federal Nonnuclear Research and Development Act of 1974 to repeal the requirement that the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration prepare a comprehensive plan for energy research, development, and demonstration, and to make such Act conform to the provisions of this Act with respect to the National Energy Policy Plan."
