    "text": "Wind Energy Systems Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1979 - Declares it to be the policy of the United States and the purpose of this Act to establish a research, development, and demonstration program for converting wind energy into electricity. Sets as a goal of such program the attainment of a total megawatt capacity of at lease 500 megawatts from wind energy systems by fiscal year 1986 and the reduction of the average cost of electricity produced by such systems to a level competitive with conventional energy sources. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into such contracts and make such grants as may be necessary or appropriate for the development of wind energy systems for commercial production and utilization. Directs the Secretary to enter into arrangements with appropriate Federal agencies to carry out projects and activities with respect to Federal facilities as may be appropriate for the demonstration of wind energy systems which are suitable and effective for use in such facilities. Sets forth criteria for selection of programs consistent with the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to monitor, collect and evaluate data and information, and conduct studies and investigations relating to wind energy systems and programs. Directs the Secretary to assure that information relating to programs, projects and other activities conducted under this Act are widely disseminated to Federal, State, and local authorities, relevant segments of the economy, the scientific community and the public, so as to promote the use of wind energy to the maximum extent feasible. Directs the Secretary to assure that small businesses will have adequate opportunities to participate in the programs conducted under this Act to the maximum extent practicable. Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
