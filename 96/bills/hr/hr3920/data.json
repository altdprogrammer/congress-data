    "text": "Amends the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 to provide compensation for members of the National Commission on Unemployment Compensation who are not full-time Federal employees. Directs that: (1) the interim reports of the Commission be sent to the President, as well as to Congress, from time to time and as the Commission deems appropriate; and (2) the due date of the Commission's final report be extended one year, until July 1, 1980. Exempts the Commission from certain provisions of the Federal Reports Act which require clearance from the Office of Management and Budget for information gathering. Provides that any reports the Commission makes to Congress shall be made directly and without clearance from the Office of Management and Budget. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to delay the effective date of provisions extending unemployment compensation coverage to certain alien agricultural workers until January 1, 1982. Provides that remuneration paid for services performed after December 31, 1979, by such alien agricultural laborers, shall be taken into account to determine whether there is such coverage for the agricultural labor of persons paying cash remuneration for the agricultural labor of other individuals (formerly, payments to such aliens were excluded in determining whether a $20,000 cash payments threshold had been reached, for purposes of such coverage)."
