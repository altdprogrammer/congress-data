Specifies that such study include a determination of any adverse health effects associated with fluoride in drinking water at different concentrations. Stipulates that a report detailing the results of such study be submitted to Congress as promptly as practicable. Exempts the areas specified for study from the national interim primary drinking water regulation respecting fluoride."
