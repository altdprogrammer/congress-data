    "text": "National Export Policy Act of 1980 - Title I: General Findings and Purposes - Sets forth congressional findings and the purposes of this Act. Title II: Export Financing - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to direct the Export-Import Bank to adopt export finance programs comparable in structure to those extraordinary measures of official export credits offered by competing countries, until such financing is limited by international agreements. Requires the Bank to report annually to Congress as to whether any additional appropriations or any increases in its commitment authority or ceiling levels are necessary to carry out this Act. States that this Act shall not take effect until six months after enactment, unless the President defers the effective date for an additional six months. Declares it to be the policy of the Congress that the Export-Import Bank of the United States should facilitate, particularly in the presence of foreign officially-supported export credit competition, exports to countries: (1) having insufficient access to international credit facilities; (2) demonstrating reasonable economic progress; and (3) offering adequate formal assurances of repayment (currently, must offer sufficient likelihood of repayment). Increases the aggregate amount of loans and contractual liability of guarantees and insurance which may be outstanding at any one time. Requires such activities to be carried out through the Export Expansion Facility. Provides for the capitalization of such facility. Establishes staggered ten-year terms of office for the Bank directors. Declares that the appropriate congressional committees should consider limitations on Bank activities when considering appropriations for international trade activities rather than when considering foreign assistance activities. Title III: Export-Related Tax Policy - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the earned income exclusion for United States citizens working abroad, who are bona fide residents of a foreign country, from an annual rate of $20,000 to: (1) $50,000; or (2) $65,000, if such persons qualify as bona fide residents for certain specified periods. Allows separate exclusions to married individuals who are both working overseas, although one's excess exclusion cannot be used against income earned by the other. Waives the residency requirements to qualify for such exclusion for those required to leave a foreign country because of civil unrest, war, or similar adverse conditions precluding the normal conduct of business. Reduces from 17 to 11 months the foreign residency requirement with respect to the deduction for certain housing expenses of living abroad. Revises the formula for determining the base housing amount with regard to such deduction to make it 16 percent of the salary of a GS-14, step 1. Repeals similar deductions for cost-of-living differential, schooling expenses, home leave travel expenses, and residence in a hardship area. Provides that the foreign bad debt loss deduction shall not exceed the greater of 15 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income from exports, or two percent of the taxpayer's export receivables outstanding at the close of the taxable year. Provides that the amount of bad debt losses that may be added to a bad debt reserve shall not exceed five percent of the taxpayer's export receivables outstanding as of the close of the taxable year. Permits the amortization, based on a period of 60 months, of: (1) foreign market studies; (2) foreign marketing expenses; and (3) foreign patents. Permits an income tax deduction for currency fluctuation losses on export credit which have not been repaid by the end of the taxable year. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to extend the six-month deadline for exempting exports from the manufacturer's excise tax for an additional 12 months if it is determined, after consultation with the Secretary of State, that exports were delayed because of war, civil unrest, or similar adverse conditions in a foreign nation. Amends the Foreign Trade Zones Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to approve the duty-free entry of machinery, materials, and fuels to be used for the production of goods in a foreign trade zone if such goods are not subsequently entered into U.S. customs territory. Sets forth requirements before applications for such treatment will be approved. Makes such approval valid for six years. Requires the Foreign Trade Zones Board to include in its annual report to Congress a summary of activities and proposals to increase the use of foreign trade zones to expand U.S. exports. Makes banking organizations which have invested in an export trading company eligible for treatment as domestic international sales corporations (DISC). Includes the gross receipts from the export of services produced in the United States and from export trade services as qualified export receipts, in the case of a DISC which is an export trading company. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, with the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and distribute information concerning the utilization of the DISC provisions. Makes export trading companies eligible for Subchapter S treatment if the shareholders of such companies are otherwise small business corporations. Exempts such companies from restrictions on the amount of foreign income they can receive and still be eligible for Subchapter S tax treatment. Title IV: Antitrust - Amends the Webb-Pomerene Act to exempt the export trade, export trade activities, and methods of operation of certified export trade associations and export trading companies from the antitrust laws. Delays the effectiveness of any certificate upon the notification of the Secretary of Commerce by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of disagreement with the decision to issue a certificate. Sets forth the procedure to be followed by any association, company, or export trading company seeking certification under this Act and by the Secretary in issuing such certificates. Provides for appeal of the Secretary's denial of certification. Authorizes the Attorney General or the FTC to bring an action to invalidate a certification. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General and the FTC, to publish guidelines for determining whether an association or export trading company will meet the certification requirements. Requires certified associations and export trading companies to submit annual reports to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Commerce an office to promote export trade associations and trading companies. Provides for automatic certification of existing associations. Requires that all applications for certification be kept confidential with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Secretary to require an association or trading company to modify its operation to be consistent with international obligations of the United States. Directs the President to appoint, with the Senate's advice and consent, a task force seven years after enactment to examine the effect of this Act and to make recommendations. Directs the Attorney General to study whether: (1) U.S. business conduct to expand exports conflicts with basic antitrust principles; and (2) a more liberal enforcement policy for overseas activities would impede implementation of the antitrust laws. Requires the Attorney General to identify such conduct which would not warrant prosecution under the antitrust laws. Sets forth the procedures for describing such permissible conduct and disclosing such descriptions. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to intervene in such suits and to provide legal assistance to exporters. Prohibits prosecution under the antitrust laws of exporters who: (1) have notified the Attorney General of their intention to engage in such designated conduct; or (2) receive an approval, or no objection, from the Attorney General concerning proposed transactions. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress concerning implementation of this section.

Requires only good faith efforts by issuers holding 50 percent or less of the equity capital to use their influence to cause transactions and dispositions of assets to be carried out consistent with such provisions. Repeals the provisions specifying prohibited foreign corrupt practices by issuers. Amends the Business Practices and Records Act to include issuers within the provisions specifying prohibited foreign corrupt practices by domestic concerns. Permits items of value to be given to foreigners in specified circumstances, including courtesy items, demonstration expenses, and payments lawful under the laws of the country of the intended recipient. Directs the Attorney General to issue guidelines specifying permissible conduct and arrangements associated with common types of export sales arrangements and business contracts and precautionary procedures creating a rebuttable presumption of compliance. Provides for the establishment of a Business Practices and Records Act Review Procedure to answer specific inquiries concerning enforcement of such Act. Requires the Attorney General to issue opinions regarding compliance. Makes such opinions final and binding on all parties if the conduct does not involve a violation. Requires annual reports to Congress by: (1) the Attorney General concerning actions taken pursuant to such Act; and (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the reporting requirements.

Directs the President to report to Congress concerning the progress of such negotiations. Requires Congress to review the Business Practices and Records Act after receiving the President's report.

Small Business Export Expansion Act of 1980 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to permit participating lending institutions to take actions on behalf of the Administrator with respect to deferred participation loans. Empowers the SBA, either directly or in cooperation with lending institutions, to extend credit for export purposes to enable small business concerns to develop foreign markets.
