    "text": "Defines an \"air traffic controller\" as a Department of Transportation employee who actively engages in the separation and control of air traffic. Restricts the controllers who are entitled to training after being judged as unfit for duty to only such controllers who: (1) are not eligible for civil service retirement benefits; (2) have completed five years of service in a position classified at grade GS-10 or above; and (3) are certified by a physician as suited for such training. Establishes within the Department a Training Program Board of Review to review each controller's training program to ensure that it meets reasonable standards for providing successful training and job placement. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to pay for only those programs which are approved by such Board."
