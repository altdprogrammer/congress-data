Sets forth the requirements such a product liability trust must meet to be tax-exempt. Includes distributions from such a trust other than for payment of product liability claims in the recipient's gross income. Imposes excise taxes on such trusts for self-dealing, unqualified expenditures, and contributions in excess of the fair market value of product liability insurance."
