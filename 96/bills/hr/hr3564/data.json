Prohibits any educational or occupational admissions test affecting interstate commerce to be administered unless: (1) each applicant is provided written notice describing the nature of the test, to whom the results will be distributed, and a statement of the applicant's rights; and (2) provision is made to provide upon request performance-related information to an individual taking such test. Provides that an individual adversely affected by a test administered, or about to be administered, in violation of this Act may sue for preventive relief in a United States district court."
