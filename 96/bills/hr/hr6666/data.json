    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Makes technical amendments to the law governing the Coast Guard Reserve. Grants a member of the Reserve on inactive duty training the same authority, rights, and privileges in the performance of that duty as a member of corresponding grade or rating of the Regular Coast Guard or of the Reserve on active duty. Retains a Reserve officer, if assigned to active duty of a limited or temporary nature from an inactive duty status, within the promotion structure for Reserve officers of the inactive Reserve. Reduces from 20 to ten years the length of commissioned service required for eligibility for promotion to rear admiral in the Reserve. Requires that the last five years of such service shall have been served in the Coast Guard Reserve. Requires the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to remove from an active status Reserve captains who have completed 30 years of total commissioned service. Reduces from five to four years the period which a Reserve rear admiral may serve before removal from active status."
