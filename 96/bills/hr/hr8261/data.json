    "text": "Congressional Regulatory Review Procedure Act - Requires each Federal agency to transmit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives a copy of each rule upon its promulgation or repromulgation. States that a rule shall not become effective if: (1) both Houses of Congress adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving it within 90 days after it is promulgated; or (2) either House adopts such a resolution within 60 days after the rule is promulgated and the other House does not disapprove such resolution within an additional 30 days. Permits a rule to become effective: (1) 60 days after it is promulgated if no committee of either House has reported or been discharged from further consideration of such a resolution; or (2) not earlier than 90 days after its promulgation if such a resolution has been reported, discharged, or adopted within such 60 day period. Prohibits an agency from promulgating a rule which is identical to a disapproved rule. Authorizes either House of Congress to adopt a concurrent resolution directing agency reconsideration of a rule. States that if the other House does not disapprove such a resolution within 60 days, the rule shall lapse within 180 days after the resolution is adopted unless the agency repromulgates the rule in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Directs an agency to provide notice of a proceeding to consider repromulgation of a rule at least 60 days before it is repromulgated, and to hold a hearing for oral presentations as part of such proceeding. Sets forth House and Senate procedure for the consideration of resolutions of disapproval and resolutions for reconsideration. Establishes in the House and the Senate a Resolutions on Regulations Calendar to which any such resolution reported by a committee or from which the committee has been discharged shall be referred."
