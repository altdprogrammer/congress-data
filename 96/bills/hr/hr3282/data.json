Establishes the Asbestos Hazards School Safety Task Force. States that such Task Force's duties shall include: (1) compiling and disseminating medical, scientific, and technical materials to State and local entities; (2) reviewing and approving State applications for grants and loans; and (3) reviewing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines established to identify schools in which exposure to asbestos constitutes a health problem and for taking corrective action at such schools; and (4) assisting in formulating standards and procedures by recommending modifications to such guidelines. Stipulates that the Task Force shall avoid duplicating activities undertaken by the EPA. Requires State educational agencies which seek administrative funds to submit to the Secretary a plan which: (1) describes the manner in which such State shall disseminate information on the health hazards of asbestos fibers; (2) describes the content of such information; and (3) describes the procedures to be used by the State in maintaining records on asbestos.
