Exempts IHA's from income taxation. Excludes from gross income distributions to a taxpayer from an individual housing account used to purchase a principal residence. Allows an income tax deduction for sales taxes on items used in the construction of new homes. Allows a refundable income tax credit for the amount of interest income which a taxpayer loses on amounts paid as real property tax prepayments. Limits the amount of such credit to $200 for the taxable year."
