    "text": "Tuition Tax Credit Act of 1979 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individual taxpayers an income tax credit for 35 percent of the tuition paid for the elementary, secondary, college, or post-secondary vocational education of the taxpayer, his spouse, or any of his dependents. Sets forth maximum dollar amounts allowable as a credit for calendar years 1979 through 1982, after which the credit expires. Treats tuition payments as paid for calendar year 1979 only if such payments are made on or after August 1, 1979, and before February 1, 1980, for education furnished on or after August 1, 1979, and before January 1, 1980. Treats tuition payments as paid for calendar years 1980 and thereafter only if such payments are made during the particular calendar year or within one month of the beginning or close of such calendar year for education furnished during that year. Defines full-time and qualified half-time student. Excludes from the definition of \"tuition\" any amounts paid for books, supplies, equipment for coursework, meals, lodging, transportation, or similar personal expenses. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school except to the extent necessary to determine whether such school is an eligible educational institution within the meaning of this Act. Provides for the immediate certification of any judicial action brought in a United States district court concerning the constitutionality of this Act to the appropriate circuit court of appeals. Authorizes direct appeal to the Supreme Court of any decision by a circuit court. Requires the expedited consideration of such a case at both judicial levels. Requires the disregard of any amount received by the taxpayer as a tuition tax credit for purposes of determining the eligibility of the taxpayer for Federal, State, or local educational assistance."
