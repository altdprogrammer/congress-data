    "text": "Declares the policy of the Congress to preserve and promote the natural, cultural, historic, and other values of the Connecticut River Valley. Establishes the Connecticut Historic Riverway to provide for the conservation of such values for the public's use and enjoyment. Provides that such riverway shall be composed of the Mount Holyoke unit together with other areas as authorized. Limits the total acreage of land and water of such unit to no more than 13,150 acres. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands, waters, and interests therein, in the Mount Holyoke unit, and specifies that the acquisition and development authority of the Secretary shall be in accordance with the Acquisition Zoning Plan, Connecticut Historic Riverway-Mount Holyoke unit and with the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations specifying approval standards for municipal ordinances affecting the Private Use and Development Zone of such zoning plan which are consistent with the provisions of this Act. Permits owners of improved property within the riverway but not acquired under this Act to elect to retain a right of use and occupancy of such property for noncommercial purposes and for a specified period upon payment by the Secretary of the fair market value of such property on the date of its acquisition less the fair market value of the right retained by the owner. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate such right upon finding that the property has ceased to be used for noncommercial residential use. Directs the Secretary to administer and protect the riverway in accordance with this Act and any other statutes. Authorizes hunting, fishing and trapping in the riverway area in accordance with applicable State and Federal law and with any restrictions the Secretary may impose as authorized by this Act. Prohibits the Federal River Commission from authorizing the construction, operation, or maintenance of any Federal Power Act project within the riverway which has not been previously licensed. Establishes the Mount Holyoke Riverway Committee to consult with the Secretary on all matters relating to development and administration of such unit and to submit to the Secretary an annual report on development and other matters relating to such unit. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the New England River Basin Commission and the Committee, to encourage coordinated planning for the conservation and development of resources of the Connecticut River Valley Corridor, with special emphasis on outdoor recreation resources outside the Boundaries of the Connecticut Historic Riverway. Directs the Secretary: (1) to encourage appropriate bodies to adopt and enforce master plans compatible with this Act; and (2) to cooperate with appropriate agencies in providing safeguards against pollution of the Connecticut River. Requires all Federal departments, agencies or instrumentalities to consult with the Secretary on any plans, programs, projects or grants having a potentially adverse effect on outdoor recreation resources of the corridor. Requires any such entity considering pending license applications for activities having such potential effect to notify the Secretary and to take no final action thereon without giving the Secretary 90 days to present his views on the subject. Directs the Secretary to cooperate with the Secretary of the Army in the study and formulation of shoreline erosion control plans for the Connecticut River. Stipulates that any such project must be carried out in accordance with a plan acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior and consistent with the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of funds necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
