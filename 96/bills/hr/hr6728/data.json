Makes funds authorized for 1981 available for: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (3) United States Antarctic Program; (4) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (5) Ocean Drilling Programs; (6) Science Education Programs; (7) engineering and applied science; (8) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (9) Cross-Directorate Program; and (10) program development and management. Limits the amount in both fiscal years which may be used for official consultation or representation at the discretion of the Director of the National Science Foundation and for the expenses of the National Science Foundation incurred outside the United States. Permits the transfer of funds from one category to another as specified. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to require the Board of such Foundation to make a report every three years on indicators of the state of science in the United States."
