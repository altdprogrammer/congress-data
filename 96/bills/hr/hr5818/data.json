    "text": "Small Business Soft Drink Energy Conservation and Interbrand Competition Act - Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to declare that exclusive territorial arrangements made as a part of a licensing agreement for the manufacture, distribution, or sale of a trademarked soft drink product are lawful under the Federal Trade Commission Act and Federal antitrust laws. Requires that: (1) such product shall be in competition with other products of the same general class; and (2) the elimination of the territorial provisions in such agreement would not adversely affect the quality of the environment, significantly increase energy consumption, cause inflation in the cost of soft drink products, or lead to concentration of economic power in the soft drink industry. Makes this Act applicable to any proceeding involving the lawfulness of any territorial provision which is pending on or commenced after the date of enactment. Requires the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to consult with the Small Business Administration prior to any action with respect to soft drink product territorial arrangements. Directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to report to the President and to Congress within two years of the date of enactment of this Act on the implementation of the provisions of this Act."
