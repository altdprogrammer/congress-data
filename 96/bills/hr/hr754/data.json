Requires that such products: (1) meet the same health standards as domestically produced meat; and (2) be tested in the exporting country. Requires periodic tests of such products in the United States by the Department of Agriculture. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe necessary assessments and fees. Title II: Dairy Products - Prohibits the importation of dairy products into the United States unless certified wholesome and pure by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requires the Secretary to establish standards for such products comparable to standards imposed on domestic dairy products. Directs the Secretary to inspect imported dairy products and to require a certificate of compliance to accompany them. Requires imported dairy products to comply with United States labeling and packaging requirements, and to carry indications on their labeling that they are imported."
