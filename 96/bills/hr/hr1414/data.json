    "text": "Liquefied Gas Marine Transportation Safety Act of 1979 - Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 to add a new title, \"Title III: Liquefied Gas Marine Transportation Safety.\" Prohibits, under such Title, the ownership, construction, or operation of an onshore liquefied bulk gas facility without a certificate of safety issued pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the ownership, design, construction, or operation of such a facility offshore except in accordance with a license issued pursuant to this Act. Sets forth the procedures for applying for a certificate or license as required by this Act. Directs the Secretary of the department under which the Coast Guard is operating to prescribe safety standards for the location, design and construction, and operation of both onshore and offshore liquefied bulk gas facilities. Requires the Secretary to promulgate environmental standards, as well as safety standards, for offshore facilities. States that regulations governing the location of such facilities shall include standards: (1) for their location at a safe distance from other facilities or operations which might be a hazard to the facility or increase the damage caused by a liquefied bulk gas incident; (2) for natural hazards, such as meteorological or geological conditions; and (3) for the availability of incident prevention and control facilities. States that regulations governing the location of onshore facilities shall include standards for the location of facilities at a safe distance from persons and property, and for the safe navigation of liquefied bulk gas vessels into such a facility. Requires regulations governing the location of offshore facilities to include standards for the location of such a facility in safe navigation areas, with respect to the effect of the facility on the marine environment, oceanic currents and wave patterns, and alternative uses of the oceans. Directs the Secretary to require that the best available technology be used in the design and construction of both onshore and offshore facilities and to prescribe minimum standards for materials and for methods and techniques of design and construction. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the operation of liquefied bulk gas facilities. States that such regulations shall include standards: (1) for the use of Coast Guard-certified tankermen in the handling and transfer of liquefied bulk gas from vessels to facilities, and for the training of other personnel; (2) for the availability and use of incident prevention and control equipment; (3) for the use of security measures at facilities for protection against intentional acts which might cause incidents; and (4) for the maintenance of facilities and equipment and periodic Coast Guard inspections. Requires, in the case of offshore facilities, standards for vessel safety including the establishment of safety zones around offshore facilities. Establishes Federal jurisdiction over offshore facilities licensed under this subtitle. Extends such jurisdiction to foreign vessels located within the safety zone of a facility. Directs the Secretary of State to seek effective international action and cooperation in support of the policy and purposes of this Act. Establishes in the United States Treasury a Liquefied Bulk Gas Incident Liability and Compensation Fund for the payment of claims under this Act. Provides for the establishment of such Fund from fees collected from facility owners, and other amounts collected pursuant to this Act. States that claims for damages arising out of a liquefied bulk gas incident may be asserted for personal injury, and loss, injury to, or destruction of real or personal property. Sets forth standards for the establishment of liability for incidents at facilities. Establishes a limit of liability of $50,000,000 for an incident except one caused through the gross negligence or willful misconduct or by a violation of applicable safety, construction, or operating standards. Promulgates a procedure for the making of a claim arising out of an incident involving a liquefied bulk natural gas facility. Sets forth procedures for the administrative and judicial settlements of claims made pursuant to this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to the President and Congress an annual report on the administration of the Fund. Sets forth the procedure for the revocation of a certificate or license issued pursuant to this Act."
