    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-02-11", 
    "text": "Reclamation Reform Act of 1980 - Sets forth acreage limitations for limited and qualified landholdings which may be served with water under Federal reclamation laws. Declares that, upon the request of a land owner or lessee, the acreage limitation for a qualified landholding shall be considered applicable to: (1) a specified amount of land classified by the Secretary of the Interior as project land having the greatest productive potential; or (2) an equivalent amount of less productive land. Directs the Secretary to take into account all factors which affect the economic feasibility of irrigated agriculture in determining the productive potential of land and land classes. States that any land for which the frost-free growing season exceeds 180 days shall be considered to be highly productive land for purposes of acreage limitations, except under certain conditions. Specifies those lands which may receive project water three years after enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to deliver project water to bona fide religious or nonprofit charitable organizations and certain excess lands, provided that such lands otherwise would be eligible to receive project water. Amends existing Federal reclamation laws to delete the 25-year limitation on the period during which lessees of lands owned by States and political subdivisions which are subject to acreage limitations may receive project water. States that no provision of Federal reclamation law shall apply to landholdings receiving benefits from a Federal water resources project which has not been designated as a Federal reclamation project. Requires an owner or qualified lessee of a limited or qualified landholding to be a resident of such landholding to be eligible to receive project water for agriculture purposes. Prohibits an owner of a qualified landholding acquired after the enactment of this Act from leasing such landholding unless the Secretary determines that the owner, during each of the last five years after acquiring the land, has derived 51 percent of his or her income directly from agricultural production. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or grant exemptions from such agricultural production requirements. Exempts from such requirement any owner who resides within 50 miles of the landholding. Amends the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 to direct the Secretary to publish notice of the proposed contract or amendment and provide an opportunity for written comments, before entering into or amending any repayment contract or contract concerning the delivery of project water for irrigation purposes. Permits the owner of any excess land: (1) to dispose of such land before the end of the term of a recordable contract, to specified persons, at a price approved by the Secretary; or (2) to request the Secretary to dispose of such land by lottery. Vests power of attorney in the Secretary to sell such land, if it is not sold by the end of the term of the contract. Repeals provisions which limit the right to receive water on sold excess lands until one-half of the construction charges have been paid. Sets forth requirements to be met before a sale of excess land, or resale of such land within 15 years of initial sale, shall carry rights to receive project water. Declares that any nonexcess land which is acquired into excess status pursuant to foreclosure or other process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of mortgage, inheritance, or devise, may be sold at its fair market value without regard to provisions of this Act or existing law. Approves water contracts pertaining to qualified landholdings, which provide that relief from acreage limitations will result upon full payment of construction charges. Specifies the expiration date for acreage limitations following the repayment of construction charges which shall apply in any case in which such date is not specified in the project repayment contract. Directs the Secretary to provide a landholder with a certificate acknowledging any relief from acreage limitations. Sets forth administrative rules and regulations for purposes of this Act and penalties for violations of this Act."
