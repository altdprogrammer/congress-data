Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to identify and describe situations and conditions which warrant special attention within the next four years, rather than the next five years as is now required, including the significant effects of current and projected trends in science and technology on the requirements of the Nation and existing and projected scientific and technological resources. Requires the director to consult with the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology concerning programs and responsibilities relating to the problems, constraints, and opportunities so identified, and to recommend legislation which will contribute to the resolution of such problems. Requires the Office of Science and Technology Policy to study on a continuing basis the impact of inflation on the conduct of federally-supported research and development. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to require the Foundation to annually submit to Congress an analysis of all Federal research and development funding by function."
