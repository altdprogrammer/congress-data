    "date": "1979-08-01", 
    "text": "Transportation Labor-Management Disputes Act of 1979 - Amends title II of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Conciliation of Labor Disputes; National Emergencies) to set forth new procedures for settling emergency labor disputes in the following transportation industries: (1) railroad; (2) airline; (3) maritime; (4) longshore (including the loading or stowage of any maritime cargo); and (5) trucking. Authorizes the President to appoint a board of inquiry to report on the issues involved in a threatened or actual strike, lockout, or other labor dispute which imperils the health or safety of the Nation or a substantial part or its population or territory, or deprives any section of the country of essential transportation services. Directs the President to file a copy of such report with the Secretary of Labor and to make public its contents. Authorizes the Secretary, upon receiving such report, to initiate one or more of the following three actions: (1) issuance of an order that for a specified period up to 30 days work shall continue with no changes in the conditions out of which the dispute arose except by agreement, during which period the parties shall bargain collectively; (2) issuance of an order for partial operation specifying the extent and condition of partial operation for a period of up to 180 days; or (3) a mediation procedure, with provision for a final offer selector panel upon impasse. Makes such orders by the Secretary and final offer by the panel conclusive unless found arbitrary or capricious by a three-judge district court, subject to Supreme Court review. Prohibits an order for partial operation from placing a greater economic burden on any party than would be imposed by a total cessation of operations. Prohibits the parties from interfering with such operation by strike or lockout. Allows the Secretary to modify such order to effectuate the purposes of this Act. Provides that no change shall be made in the terms and conditions of employment during such period except by agreement, but allows the Secretary to suspend or modify any particular existing term and condition which is inconsistent with the conditions of partial operation. Provides, with respect to the mediation procedure, that: (1) the Secretary shall direct the parties to submit a list of resolved and unresolved issues and shall send a copy of a complete list to each party; (2) each party shall then submit to the Secretary a final and one alternate final offer covering all unresolved issues; (3) the Secretary may act as a mediator during a five-day period during which the parties shall continue to bargain collectively; (4) if no settlement is reached the parties shall mutually appoint a three-member panel to act as the final offer selector (if the parties are unable to agree, the President shall appoint the panel); (5) the panel shall conduct an informal hearing and select a final, unaltered offer from the parties' final and alternate offers which it determines to be the most reasonable, taking into account the public interest and other employment factors; and (6) such final offer shall be binding upon the parties, whether or not signed by both parties."
