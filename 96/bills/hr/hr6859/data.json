Requires the taxpayer to demonstrate that at least 80 percent of his commutes are with use of such passes provided by his employer. Declares such passes to be nontransferable. Allows a credit against the income tax of an employer of an amount equal to five percent of the cost of such passes. Requires substantiation of such costs with a receipt from the local transit authority. Requires the pass plan to be nondiscriminatory and in writing."
