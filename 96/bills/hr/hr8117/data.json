    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to extend by three years the date by which public water systems which have been granted an exemption from contaminant level and treatment technique requirements must meet such requirements. Provides an alternative procedure by which a State with an underground injection control program relating to oil or natural gas production or recovery may receive approval for obtaining primary enforcement responsibility for protecting its underground water sources. Authorizes a State to demonstrate that its underground injection control program meets the minimum requirements of State program regulations and will prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources, rather than file an application which meets the regulations established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection AGency. Authorizes a State which has made such a demonstration to make a similar demonstration with respect to any amended requirement of underground injection rather than file a notice that the State program meets the new requirement. Prohibits the application of requirements to determine whether a State retains primary enforcement responsibility if the State initially acquired the responsibility because of such a demonstration. Authorizes the Administrator to determine, after an opportunity for public hearing, that such a demonstration is no longer valid and to remove primary enforcement responsibility from the State. Permits a State which has primary enforcement responsibility to exempt a public water system from a contaminant level or treatment technique requirement if the system was not in operation at the time the requirement took effect and no reasonable alternative source of drinking water is available. Prohibits underground water source protection grants to any State which has not assumed primary enforcement responsibility within a specified time. Directs the Administrator to make grants to a public water system which is required to meet more stringent standards relating to drinking water turbidity than the standards of the Act. Requires that such grants be used for the development and demonstration of any water filtration system which will demonstrate a new or improved method of meeting such more stringent standards."
