Authorizes the Secretary to implement a national moratorium on the repayment or foreclosure on loans made or held by the Secretary or under the provisions of any law administered by the Farmers Home Administration for up to three years if warranted by emergencies adversely affecting the agricultural economy. Requires the Secretary to implement a local moratorium on repayment or foreclosure for any county or area which has been declared a disaster area in 1980. Authorizes the Secretary to consolidate or reschedule such loans for payment. Sets forth the terms for such payment."
