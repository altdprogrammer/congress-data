Withdraws all lands within such wilderness from all forms of entry or appropriation under the mining laws and from the operation of the mineral leasing laws of the United States. Increases the authorization of appropriations, from $12,000,000 to $20,000,000 for the acquisition of lands to be added to the Cibola National Forest. Allows specified lands to be included within such national forest until a determination by the Secretary of Agriculture that the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, has acquired an option to purchase specified lands for open space or city park use. Stipulates that if such option is not exercised such land shall no longer be included in such national forest."
