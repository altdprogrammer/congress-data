    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 96-1055) Communications Cross-Ownership Act of 1980 - Amends the Communications Act to 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from granting any commercial broadcasting station license to any applicant if: (1) such applicant, at the time such application is made, owns, controls, or operates any daily newspaper; and (2) the station signal of the broadcasting station for which such license is sought will encompass the entire community in which such daily newspaper is published. Prohibits the Commission from renewing any commercial broadcasting station license for a term which is due to end after June 1, 1980, if the licensee involved: (1) owns, controls, or operates the only commercial aural broadcasting stations which encompass the entire community required to be served under the license with a city-grade signal; (2) owns, controls, or operates the only daily newspaper which is published in such community; and (3) owned, controlled, or operated such station and such newspaper as of January 1, 1975. Stipulates that such restrictions shall not apply to a commercial aural broadcasting station licensee if: (1) a commercial television broadcasting station is licensed to serve the community which is served by the commercial aural station involved; and (2) such commercial television broadcasting station is not owned, controlled, or operated by such commercial aural broadcasting station license. Permits any licensee who, on the effective date of this Act, owns , controls, or operates a daily newspaper and is the licensee of a commercial broadcasting station which has a station signal which encompasses the entire community in which such newspaper is published, to apply for renewal of such license and not be required to relinquish ownership or control of such broadcasting station or such newspaper. Prohibits any licensees from transferring, assigning, or otherwise disposing of the commercial broadcasting station license held by such licensee and the ownership of, or any interest in, the daily newspaper to the same person, except in specified conditions. Prohibits the Commission, in considering an application for the renewal of a broadcasting station license, from taking into account the following: (1) any ownership interest which is held by the renewal applicant involved in any other broadcasting station or in any nonbroadcasting communications medium; or (2) any participation by such renewal applicant in the day-to-day administration and operation of the broadcasting station involved. Permits the Commission to consider ownership interests or official connections in other broadcast stations or other nonbroadcast communications media where the Commission does not have in effect a rule of general applicability which prohibits or restricts such interests or connections. States that this Act does not affect the applicability or enforcement of the Federal antitrust laws. States that this Act does not affect specified proceedings before the Commission or in the courts before September 10, 1980. Repeals the provision of the Communications Act of 1934 relating to consolidations and mergers of telegraph carriers. Sets the radio and television broadcasting station operating licensing term at not more than five years. Permits the renewal of such license for an additional five years. Sets the initial licensing and renewal term for the operation of other classes of stations at not more than ten years. Permits the Commission to adopt rules and procedures relating to the renewal of a broadcast station license where a compelling application for the same facilities has been filed."
