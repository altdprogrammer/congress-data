Sets forth the procedure for making such claims or settling such claims. Permits a claimant, whose claim is denied or not settled within 60 days of presentation, to commence a district court action against the Secretary in lieu of resubmitting such claim to the Secretary for a decision. Prohibits claimants receiving compensation from recovering under any other Federal or State law for the same injury. Permits States to impose additional requirements or liability. Directs the Secretary to make a grant to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for the construction and operation of a saltwater fish hatchery. Stipulates that the amount of compensation payable to Texas shall be reduced by the amount of such grant."
