Directs the Secretary of Transportation to encourage the private sector development of the rail passenger corridor between Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Directs the Secretary to: (1) cooperate with specified bodies to remove institutional and legal barriers to such private development; (2) ensure that investment of Federal funds in contiguous corridors is coordinated with privately developed corridors; and (3) coordinate the investment of Federal funds with other government and private funds for nonoperational improvements. Directs the Secretary to report on such actions to Congress by February 15, 1981. Authorizes an appropriation for the purposes of this Act for fiscal year 1981."
