Repeals requirements that such a discount: (1) not exceed five percent; (2) be offered to all prospective buyers; and (3) be adequately disclosed in accordance with regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Repeals the authority of the Board to promulgate regulations characterizing cash discounts as finance charges under the Truth in Lending Act or State usury and credit disclosure laws."
