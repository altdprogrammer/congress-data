    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Public Works and Transportation with amendment, H. Rept. 96-983) Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to extend through fiscal years 1981 and 1982 authorizations for: (1) pilot programs of manpower development, training, and retraining for the operation and maintenance of treatment works and related activities; (2) a system for forecasting and publishing the supply of and demand for professions and other occupations for regional, State, or area pollution prevention, reduction, and elimination; (3) grants for pollution control programs; (4) training grants and contracts and scholarships; (5) grants for developing and operating a continuing areawide waste treatment management planning process; (6) a program, administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, to install and maintain measures incorporating best management practices to control nonpoint source pollution in specified areas; (7) grants to States for Clean Lakes programs; and (8) a general authorization for specified programs under such Act. Repeals specified limitations and conditions on grants under such Act for the construction of treatment works which required that: (1) the applicant make provision for receiving payment from industrial users of the treatment works for that portion of the Federal share of the construction cost of such works allocable to industrial wastes treatment; (2) the grantee retain a specified portion of such revenues; and (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency be authorized to exempt certain industrial users from such payments. Repeals provisions of the Clean Water Act of 1977 which provided for a moratorium on such payments for treatment works by industrial users. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to repeal provisions for such payments for treatment works by industrial users to the United States in the case of privately owned treatment works. Makes other technical and conforming amendments to such Act. Extends from July 1, 1983 to July 1, 1985 the final deadline for municipal compliance with specified requirements for construction of publicly owned treatment works. Removes certain time-limitations for filing requests for specified extensions of the time of such compliance. Repeals specified limitations on approval of applications for Federal reimbursement for advanced construction of municipal treatment works projects. Raises the construction cost limits applicable to a combined grant procedure for the Federal share of the cost of preparing construction plans and specifications and the building and erection of treatment works."
