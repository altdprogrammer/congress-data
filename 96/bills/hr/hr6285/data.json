    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1980-06-04", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Egg Research and Consumer Information Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act to raise the maximum allowable number of members of the Egg Board from 18 to 20. Provides that two such voting members, and alternates therefor, be consumers or representatives of consumers, if approved by egg producers. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make such consumer appointments from nominations submitted by eligible organizations. Authorizes the Secretary to make such consumer appointments as necessary to protect consumer interests if such nominees are not members of bona fide consumer organizations or do not represent consumers. Raises the limit on the rate of assessment prescribed by the order of the Egg Board from five cents to seven and one-half cents per case of commercial eggs or the equivalent thereof for fiscal year 1981. Permits such rate to be increased by no more than three-quarters of a cent for each fiscal year thereafter, up to ten cents per case. Declares that the failure of egg producers to approve an amendment to any Egg Research and Promotion Order shall not be deemed to invalidate such order. Sets a minimum civil penalty of $500 for violations of this Act. Raises the maximum civil penalty for such violations from $1,000 to $5,000. Authorizes the Secretary to issue cease and desist orders against such violations, in addition to or in lieu of such civil penalties. Requires notice and opportunity for a hearing before such penalties may be assessed or such orders issued. Permits appeals of such penalties or orders in the appropriate U.S. court of appeals. Provides for civil penalties for failure to obey cease and desist orders which have become final and unappealable. Directs the Secretary to refer unpaid civil penalties to the Attorney General, who shall recover such amounts assessed in the appropriate U.S. district court. Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish a joint working group with the Federal Reserve Board, Department of the Treasury, and Securities and Exchange Commission to analyze and report to the appropriate committees of Congress on specified aspects of events on the silver cash and futures markets during the September 1979 through March 1980 period."
