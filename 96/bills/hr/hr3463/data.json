Authorizes, pursuant to such agreements, payment to be made for skilled nursing services and intermediate care services furnished by a hospital. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into such agreements on a demonstration basis with hospitals having between 100 and 150 beds if such hospitals meet the other requirements of this Act."
