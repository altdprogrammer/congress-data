Limits the authorized appropriation to a health service agency to $3,750,000 for any fiscal year. Amends the alternative sets of requirements which a health maintenance organization or combination of such organizations must meet in order to buy, lease, or acquire a health care facility. Modifies the definitions of the terms \"provider of health care\" and \"expenditure minimum.\" Exempts expenditures for health research not affecting a facility's services or charges to its patients from the requirement of a capital expenditure certificate of need. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for primary health centers. Makes other technical changes in specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act and other Federal laws regarding health planning."
