    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #403 (383-0)) Veterans' Rehabilitation and Education Amendments of 1980 - =Title I: Revision of Vocational Rehabilitation Program= - Revises veterans' vocational rehabilitation provisions to declare the purpose of this Act to be to provide all services necessary to enable veterans with service-connected disabilities to attain maximum independence, to become employable, and to obtain and maintain suitable employment. Redefines \"vocational rehabilitation\" to include the provision of all services required to achieve the purpose of this Act, including discharge, medical, social, psychological, economic, and vocational services (presently defined in terms of educational and vocational training to restore employability). Defines \"employment handicap\" as a disability impairing a veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests. Revises entitlement provisions to: (1) make eligibility run as of September 16, 1940, (rather than World War II as at present); (2) require a handicap to be an employment handicap as defined by this Act; and (3) provide for follow up vocational services to a rehabilitated veteran in order for such veteran to enter new employment more suitable to his or her current capacity or condition. Eliminates the language extending eligibility for specified veterans to October 15, 1971. Sets forth the scope of services, including: (1) evaluation of rehabilitation potential; (2) educational, vocational and personal counseling; (3) a vocational rehabilitation plan; (4) vocational and related services including tutorial services, tuition, books, and other training materials; (5) treatment for mental and emotional disorders; (6) medical care; (7) prosthetic and other corrective devices; (8) placement and postplacement services; (9) services to a veteran's family; (10) special rehabilitation services, including services for the blind and the deaf; (11) subsistence allowances; (12) essential employment equipment and supplies for severely disabled veterans requiring homebound training and or self-employment; (13) transportation costs, including pre- and post-training services; and (14) work study allowance, loans, and other incidental goods and services.

Revises subsistence allowance provisions to: (1) provide for payments during the evaluation of vocational rehabilitation potential; (2) provide payments for unpaid on-job training or work experience in a Federal agency or during such evaluation period; (3) pay room and board expenses for individuals pursuing a program on a residential basis in a specialized rehabilitation facility; (4) provide that vocational payments be paid on a full-time basis for two months following a determination of employability; (5) set forth the rate of payment for individuals in unpaid Federal training or work experience; (6) prohibit payments to incarcerated individuals; and (7) provide for advance payment of subsistence allowances. Authorizes personal adjustment counseling during the evaluation of rehabilitation feasibility period. Sets forth basic requirements of a vocational rehabilitation program, which shall include: (1) participation by the veteran in formulation of a written plan; and (2) a statement of objectives and goals, services and a time schedule for providing such services, and a projected completion date. Revises leave of absence provisions to remove the 30-day per year limitation on such leave. Revises the regulation of conduct provisions to remove the three-month forfeiture of subsistence penalty for unsatisfactory conduct and to replace the permanent disqualification for further vocational rehabilitation penalty with a provision allowing the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to reinstate such benefits upon satisfactory conduct. Increases the maximum amount of loans available to a veteran from $200 to $400. Authorizes vocational rehabilitation to members of the Armed Forces, otherwise eligible, and veterans hospitalized in VA or non-VA medical facilities.

Directs the Administrator to appoint a Veterans' Advisory Committee on Rehabilitation. Revises provisions concerning the limitation on periods of assistance under two or more veterans' educational assistance programs to include post-Vietnam era benefits within such limitation, and to provide a 48-month aggregate eligibility period for vocational rehabilitation and other educational assistance. Limits the current provision which reduces the number of clock hours of attendance required for payment of benefits for certain courses to courses accredited by nationally recognized accrediting agencies.

Includes post- Vietnam era veterans' educational assistance, and deletes vocational rehabilitation, within such committee's responsibility. =Title IV: Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program Adjustments= - Makes eligible for participation in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program certain persons who entered military service on or after January 1, 1977, after having served on active duty before or after such date for a period of 180 days or less and were discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable. Revises the procedure for distribution of unused contributions to such program fund by the participant, if the participant dies while on, or after discharge from, active duty and has not designated a beneficiary under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program. =Title V: Veterans Employment and Training Programs= - Defines \"veteran\" for purposes of veterans' job counseling, training, and placement benefits, and disabled and Vietnam era veterans' employment and training benefits as one who: (1) served on active-duty for more than 180 days and received other than a dishonorable discharge; or (2) received a service-connected disability discharge.

Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations to set forth the rate of interest to be charged. Repeals the authority of the Administrator to deduct from future payments any overpayment made to parents for dependency and indemnity compensation. Revises existing provisions of law relating to overpayments made to veterans receiving educational assistance to declare that such overpayment constitutes a liability of the veteran to the United States (present provisions cover the liability of the institution attended by the veteran). Stipulates that if such liability of the veteran is waived, the institution is not released from its liability. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to disclose to a consumer reporting agency the name and address of an individual indebted to the Veterans' Administration (VA) for the purpose of obtaining consumer reports in order to assess such individual's ability to repay the debt and to give notice of the outstanding obligation. Prohibits: (1) the VA from disclosing other information that would imply an individual's indebtedness to the United States; and (2) the credit reporting agency from indicating in its reports or files that such VA inquiry indicates any indebtedness by such individual (willful violation punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 for the first offense and up to $20,000 for a subsequent offense). Authorizes the disclosure of an individual's name, address, and other identifying information necessary to locate him or her in order to carry out specified VA evaluation studies. Requires the Administrator to make a pre-disclosure determination that the inclusion of a particular individual in such study is clearly warranted. Establishes other disclosure requirements similar to those for indebtedness disclosures. Authorizes the disclosure of information affecting an individual's credit rating (name, address, indebtedness) if such individual has failed to respond to administrative debt-collection efforts. Requires the VA, before making such indebtedness disclosures, to: (1) notify an individual of the information to be disclosed, and to which credit agencies, at least 30 days prior to such disclosure; (2) inform the individual of his or her right to dispute the debt claim; and (3) make a determination regarding any such disputed debt.
