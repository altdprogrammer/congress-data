    "text": "Rock Island Railroad Employee Assistance Act - Expresses Congressional findings regarding the provision of protection for the employees of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company. Provides for priority hiring of Rock Island employees by other railroads so long as it does not interfere with other carriers' equal employment obligations. Specifies that the rights afforded to Rock Island Railroad employees by this Act shall be coequal to Chicago, Milwaukee, Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad Company employees under the Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act. Prescribes methods by which the Rock Island Railroad and labor organizations representing the employees of such railroad may enter into an agreement on labor protection for employees adversely affected as a result of a reduction in service by such railroad. Directs the parties, if unable to enter into an employee protection agreement within a specified period, to immediately submit the matter to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Requires that within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission impose upon the parties an arrangement with respect to employee protection, unless the Rock Island Railroad and the authorized representatives of its employees have entered into a labor protection agreement. Provides that any order of the Commission entered pursuant to such an agreement may not be stayed by any court and is appealable directly to an appropriate United States circuit court of appeals. Requires that such appeal shall be filed within five days after entry of the Commission's order, and that the court shall finally determine any such appeal within 60 days after it is filed. Prohibits any other court from reviewing such a determination by the court of appeals. Directs the court having jurisdiction over the reorganization of the Rock Island Railroad to direct the Railroad's trustee and the labor organizations representing the employees of the Railroad, to implement any employee protection arrangement imposed by the Commission. Requires that employee benefit or allowance claims under such agreements be filed with the Railroad Retirement Board. Directs the Board to determine the amount for which an employee is eligible and to certify such amount to the Rock Island Railroad for payment. Directs that such payments be made from the assets of the Rock Island Railroad and treated as administrative expenses of the estate of the Rock Island Railroad. Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (formerly Health, Education, and Welfare) to make specified records available to the Board. Requires the Board to prepare lists of employees separated from employment to be made available on request to other rail carriers, and to maintain such lists through December 31, 1984. Allows an employee who elects to receive a separation allowance from the Rock Island Railroad under an employee protection agreement to receive from the Board reasonable expenses for training for new career opportunities. Sets forth eligibility requirements for such assistance. Prohibits any such assistance after April 1, 1984. Provides, generally, that an employee who receives assistance under an employee protection agreement or an arrangement entered into pursuant to this Act shall be deemed to waive any employee protection benefits otherwise available to such employee under the Bankruptcy Act or any other applicable contract or agreement. Authorizes appropriations for new career training assistance. Authorizes appropriations to the Board to cover administrative expenses. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to guarantee obligations, not to exceed $75,000,000, of the Rock Island Railroad for purposes of providing employee protection. Orders such obligations to be treated as administrative expenses of the estate of the Rock Island Railroad. Limits to $75,000,000 the aggregate unpaid principal amount of obligations which may be guaranteed by the Secretary. Limits to $75,000,000 the total liability of the Rock Island Railroad in connection with benefits and allowances provided under employee protection agreements or arrangements entered into under this Act. Exempts transactions under this Act from the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. Directs the Board to publish, within 45 days of this Act, and make available for distribution by the Rock Island Railroad to all eligible employees, a document which describes in detail the rights of such employees."
