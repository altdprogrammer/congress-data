Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to extend its coverage to discrimination based on age in public accommodations, public facilities, and public education. Requires the Community Services Administration to provide assistance in resolving difficulties relating to discriminatory practices based on age. Prohibits discrimination based on age in: (1) the sale or rental of housing; (2) the financing of housing; and (3) the provision of brokerage services. Prohibits intimidation of any person because of age because such person is or has been selling, purchasing, or renting any dwelling. Defines \"age\" for the purposes of the amendments made by this Act, as being considered too old, but only if the individual has attained the age of 40 years."
