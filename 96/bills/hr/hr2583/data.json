    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Discontinues payment of a civil service pension annuity to an annuitant who becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States. Resumes such payments in the same amount upon resignation or retirement from such reemployment. Allows such former employees or former Members of Congress, any time before resigning or retiring from active service as a judge or justice, to apply for and be paid the amount by which their lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid to them. Permits present or former justices or judges who voided the right to receive an annuity, having been refunded the lump-sum credit, to redeposit such refund and thereby reestablish eligibility to receive an annuity. Authorizes any surviving spouse of such a judge or justice to redeposit such refund and receive both: (1) the annuity to which the judge or justice would have been entitled; and (2) any survivor annuity the judge or justice could have provided under the provisions of law in effect at the time of separation from the service on which title to the annuity is based. Requires that a surviving spouse, other than a surviving spouse who remarried, of a justice who died before October 19, 1976, shall be paid an annuity of $20,000 per year from the Judicial Survivors' Annuities Fund as if such justice had elected to deposit the amount required to provide annuities through such Fund. Requires such an annuity to be increased to reflect cost-of-living increases as any other annuity payable from such Fund is increased. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to determine and deposit the amount necessary to offset any resulting deficiency in the Fund. Repeals provisions of Federal law requiring the Administrative Office of the United States to pay a $10,000 annuity to the surviving widow of a justice who died on or before August 20, 1972."
