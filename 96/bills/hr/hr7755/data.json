    "text": "Special Areas Soil Conservation Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a program for the conservation of soil, water, and related resources in specified areas by providing technical and financial assistance to owners and operators of non-Federal farm, ranch, and other lands. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with owners of land within such designated areas. Limits contracts with owners of non-farm or non-ranch land to owners of lands with erosion problems which threaten adjoining farm or ranch land. Requires such contracts to assist in making necessary changes in cropping systems or land uses. Requires the owner or operator of such land to furnish the Secretary with a plan of farming operations or land use which incorporates practical conservation practices and outlines a schedule for the implementation of such practices. Requires such owner or operator to forfeit future and refund past payments if the Secretary determines the submitted plan has not been substantially followed. Sets forth other terms of such contract. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate or modify such agreement if to do so would be in the public interest. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report assessing the problems, objectives, and a schedule for implementation of this program in a designated special area. Requires the approval of such committees before such area shall be finally designated. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) utilize the services of State and local agencies; (2) fund research necessary to develop new technologies for controlling erosion-related problems in a designated special area; and (3) provide grants to any State containing lands within such areas to conduct an evaluation and analysis of the local and State tax structures and their effect on the implementation and maintenance of conservation measures. Directs the Secretary to: (1) report annually to Congress on the activities and results of such program; and (2) protect program participants to the degree possible from any penalty under other agricultural programs for participating in such program."
