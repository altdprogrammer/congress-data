    "text": "Declares that, if any crude oil delivery system for transporting Alaskan and other crude oil to northern tier and inland States is approved for expedited processing of Federal permits pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, any refinery currently receiving crude oil by tanker must execute agreements to provide for the delivery of crude oil supplies by pipeline. States that such agreements must be executed within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Directs the President, in the event such agreements should not be made, to require the use of a pipeline system if doing so would help meet environmental protection requirements with respect to the transportation of crude oil. States that the President shall not require the use of such system if the net costs of pipeline delivery will significantly increase the cost of products from affected refineries. Provides for the expedited resolution by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of disagreements on tariffs for transportation of crude oil to refineries affected by this Act. States that, in resolving any dispute, the Commission shall establish a tariff schedule which will share the costs of connecting such refineries throughout the entire pipeline system. Sets forth exceptions to this Act."
