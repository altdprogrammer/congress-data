Authorizes the Administrator to issue regulations permitting a recipient of assistance to develop, for two or more covered programs, an integrated program plan to: (1) increase program management efficiency and environmental effectiveness; (2) reduce program duplication and overlap; and (3) limit the transfer of such recipient's Federal and non-Federal funds to any covered program. Directs the Administrator to assure that such plans further the objectives of this Act and the covered programs. Authorizes appropriations for supplementary assistance for fiscal years 1982-1986. Directs the Administrator to establish criteria for such assistance, and specifies the minimum considerations for such criteria. Prohibits additional EPA support for any activity funded by supplementary assistance. Directs the Administrator to assure that a State's integrated program plan provides Federal or State funding to any local government given responsibility by a State under such plan. Directs States to consult with local governments and the public in developing such plans. Sets forth administrative provisions relating to maintenance of effort and accountability for expenditures. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress with recommendations on the programs set up under this Act."
