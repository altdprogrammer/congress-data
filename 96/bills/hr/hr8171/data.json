    "text": "Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate and implement a program for furthering the conservation of soil, water, and related resources through annual grants to conservation districts. Requires such districts to be eligible for such grants to have in effect both a long-range program and an annual work plan and provide equal matching funds or in-kind services. Alters the matching fund formula whenever a component of the long-range program or annual work plan of a conservation district involves a national objective. Requires such plans and programs to be formulated in consultation with and approved by the Secretary and the State soil conservation agency. Requires such programs and work plans to include one or more of the following objectives: (1) soil erosion prevention and control; (2) cropland, forest, woodland, pasture, or rangeland improvement; (3) water conservation, development and management, and water quality improvement; (4) agricultural land retention or preservation; and (5) demonstration projects to test and publicize the effectiveness of natural resource management systems adapted to local conditions. Sets forth optional objectives. Permits the Secretary to enter into long-term agreements of not more than ten years. Sets forth recordkeeping requirements for each conservation district receiving assistance under this Act. Directs the Secretary to require the landowner or operator of land with a specified, large amount of soil loss or with unhealthy land or water management practices to develop and implement a soil and water conservation plan approved by the conservation district as a condition of eligibility to receive any benefit under all but specified Department of Agriculture programs. Requires the Secretary to provide cost-sharing and/or loan assistance for such plan. Requires the Secretary to report biennially to specified congressional committees on the program's progress."
