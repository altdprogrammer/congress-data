    "text": "Community Energy Act - Title I: General Provisions - Sets forth: (1) congressional findings; (2) the purpose of this Act (to develop a national community energy policy); and (3) definitions of terms used in this Act. Title II: Local Energy Management Partnership Community Energy Block Grants - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make energy conservation block grants from the Solar and Conservation Reserve in order to encourage units of general local government to adopt and implement community plans and programs designed to achieve significant energy savings and encourage the use of renewable energy resources. Requires a grant applicant to submit a three year comprehensive community energy conservation strategy which describes energy needs and directives. Directs the Secretary to annually review and audit each grantee's program. Provides that 80 percent of funds appropriated for grants in any year shall be allocated to metropolitan areas. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to make grants to units of local government and to States and areawide planning organizations on behalf of units of local government to implement energy projects which the Secretary finds will contribute to a significant reduction in the use of nonrenewable energy supplies. Prohibits making such grants: (1) if the grant will not primarily benefit the public; (2) for projects intended to facilitate the relocation of industrial or commercial plants of facilities, unless the relocation does not significantly and adversely affect the unemployment or economic base from which the plant is to be relocated; or (3) for projects which could be successful without Federal financial assistance. Directs the Secretary to annually review and audit such projects. Limits to 80 percent the funds available for grants to units of local government located in metropolitan areas. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to establish and operate a National Community Energy Reference Center to provide information and technical assistance in planning and implementing local programs and activities in conservation and renewable resources to units of local government, areawide planning organizations, and neighborhood and community-based organizations. Title III: State Energy Management Partnership - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize the Secretary of Energy to provide financial assistance to assist States and Indian tribes to develop, implement, or modify a State energy plan, or portion thereof, submitted pursuant to its energy plan and to provide technical assistance to States and Indian tribes for energy planning and management. Directs the Secretary to prescribe guidelines for State energy plans which plans shall include: (1) a description of State energy supply and demand and of it goals and policies; (2) a management plan for, and a description of, planned uses of funds provided pursuant to this Act and under any other Federal financial assistance program that the State intends to use to implement the State energy plan; (3) a description of how the State plans to implement the energy conservation and renewable resource programs required by this Act; (4) preparation of a State emergency conservation plan prepared pursuant to the Emergency Energy Conservation Act; (5) a description of the provisions of the participation of units of local government, Indian tribes, and the public; (6) a program to grant appropriate units of local government authority to enact energy related ordinances which include mandatory measures; and (7) a description of the means by which the preparation and implementation of the State energy plan will be coordinated with plans and programs of State agencies and units of local government for economic development, transportation, environmental protection, coastal management, and other energy-related purposes, and assurance that due regard will be given to the needs of the poor, handicapped, and elderly. Requires each State receiving financial assistance pursuant to its State energy plan to: (1) implement the Building Energy Performance Standards program of the Energy Conservation and Production Act; (2) permit motor vehicles to turn right ar a red light after stopping; (3) provide for a program to prevent unfair or deceptive practices affecting commerce which relate to the implementation of energy conservation and renewable resource measures; (4) promote the availability of carpools, vanpools, and public transportation; (5) utilize energy conservation measures and renewable resources in State facilities; and (6) provide for an energy extension program as described in the National Energy Extension Service Act. Requires a State receiving assistance pursuant to its State energy plan to provide: (1) for a satisfactory consultation process with local government units, Indian tribes, and the public; (2) financial assistance to local government units; and (3) for the direct involvement of those units of local government that own and operate a public utility engaged in energy demand and supply forecasting activities as must be provided for in a State energy plan. Sets forth various administrative provisions, including that a State or unit of local government receiving financial assistance, under its State energy plan must provide that at least 70 percent of the assistance will be spent for the development and implementation of programs for energy conservation and renewable resources. Authorizes a State to make an annual consolidated application for financial assistance authorized under this Act and under any State energy program or programs. Repeals provisions of the National Energy Extension Service Act which provide for the establishment, implementation, and authorization of appropriations for the Energy Extension Service."
