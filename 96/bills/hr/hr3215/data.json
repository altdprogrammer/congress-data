    "text": "Winter Emergency Highway and Transportation Repair Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to enter into a contract with each State for the payment of 90 percent of the costs of repairing weather related damage to: (1) highways in such State; and (2) the surface rails of urban mass transportation systems in such State (other than railroads). Stipulates that such damage must be attributable to the weather during the winter during which this Act is enacted or the first winter which begins after the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to determine that a State is capable of paying its share of such costs before such a contract may be entered into. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding such repair program."
