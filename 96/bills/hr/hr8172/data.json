    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to make the same standard of performance of allowable emissions apply to any stationary source (currently fossil fuel fired stationary sources are also required to reduce emissions if such fuels are not treated prior to combustion). Removes the requirement that a system of continuous emission reduction be technological. Permits coal-fired stationary sources to substitute coal having low-pollution characteristics for coal having high-pollution characteristics as a means of limiting emissions. Includes the use of coal having low-pollution characteristics as the best available control technology for coal-fired stationary sources. Disapproves any State plan, if not amended, which: (1) prohibits the use of such coal to limit emissions; or (2) does not permit the reduction of any air pollutant which is attributable to the substitution of such fuel for fuel having high-pollution characteristics."
