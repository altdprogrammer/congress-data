    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 to exclude from the definition of \"producer\" any fruit, vegetable, or nut grower. Defines \"bargaining\" for the purposes of such Act. Makes a refusal to bargain in good faith with an association of producers producing under a certified contract a prohibited practice under such Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a certificate to any association of producers which desires to bargain and which meets specified criteria. Requires such an association to: (1) submit to the Secretary a petition for accreditation; (2) have contracts with its members that are binding under State law; (3) be directly producer- owned and controlled; (4) act as principal or agent for its members in contract negotiations for the production, sale, and marketing of their product; and (5) submit an annual report to the Secretary. Sets forth the procedures for the granting, modification, and revocation of association certification. Grants the Secretary, rather than the Attorney General, enforcement power under such Act. Sets forth the enforcement and review process. Establishes civil penalties for violations of orders issued by the Secretary under such Act. Makes any final regulation of the Secretary subject to Congressional disapproval."
