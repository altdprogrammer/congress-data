    "text": "(House receded and concurred in Senate amendment with amendment) Military Construction Appropriation Act, 1980 - Makes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 for military construction projects and for military family housing, including appropriations to eliminate losses caused by fluctuations in Foreign currency exchange rates. Appropriates $1,000,000 for use in the Homeowners Assistance Fund. Prohibits the use of funds under this Act for the procurement of steel if American steel producers, fabricators, and manufacturers have been denied the opportunity to compete for such steel procurement. Excludes purchases of steel for NATO from the prohibition against using funds under this Act to buy non-American steel. Provides that up to $1,000,000 in funds appropriated under this Act for the Air Force shall be available to assist State and local governments in potential MX basing areas to conduct studies and evaluations of such system in their areas. Provides that no funds may be used in a fashion which would commit the U.S. to only one basing mode for the MX missile system."
