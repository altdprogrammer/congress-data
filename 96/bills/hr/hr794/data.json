    "text": "Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to authorize the Secretary of Labor to make visits to the work place of any employer, upon the request of the employer, to consult with and advise the employer concerning the obligations of the employer under such Act. Directs the Secretary to give priority to small business and hazardous workplaces. Stipulates that no consultative visit made under this Act may serve as an inspection or investigation as otherwise provided for by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, except: (1) in the case of an employer who fails to eliminate a danger disclosed during such a visit; or (2) if conditions are found during such a visit which indicate the probability that death or serious harm could result to employees therefrom, the Secretary may notify the employer of such conditions and afford him a reasonable time to eliminate such conditions. Directs the Secretary to establish education programs to inform employers and employees of the hazards in particular industries."
