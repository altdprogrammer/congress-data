    "text": "Small Business Development Center Act of 1980 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make grants to States, regional entities, and any public or private institution of higher education to assist them in developing centers to provide small businesses with a broad range of advice, information, and assistance. Requires grant applicants to obtain matching funds on a 50-50 basis from non-Federal sources. Limits any recipient from receiving a grant greater than its pro rata (based on population) share of a $65,000,000 program, or $200,000, whichever is greater. Sets forth application guidelines. Authorizes the SBA to permit a center to provide assistance to small businesses within close proximity located in another State. Requires applicants to assist small businesses to solve their business problems in such areas as: operations, manufacturing, engineering, technology and development, personnel administration, marketing, sales, merchandising, finance, accounting, and business strategy development. Sets forth services to be provided by such centers including: (1) counseling; (2) information services; (3) research and surveys; and (4) financial, legal, and other business-related information and consulting sources. Authorizes the use of consultants, engineers, and testing laboratories. Directs the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to cooperate with small business development centers participating in the program, to report annually to the SBA and the Congress, and to make recommendations to the SBA on continued funding. Directs the Administrator of the SBA to appoint a Deputy Associate Administrator for Management Assistance to administer the small business development center program. Establishes a National Small Business Development Center Advisory Board composed of nine members appointed by the Administrator to advise and confer with the Deputy Associate Administrator for Management Assistance. Requires each State small business development center to establish an advisory board appointed by the Governor to advise and confer with the Director of such State small business development center. Directs the SBA, with the advice of the Board, to establish an evaluation plan of the center program and to submit a report to the Senate Select Committee on Small Business and the House Committee on Small Business by January 31, 1982. Eliminates such program as of October 1, 1983. States that on or after October 1, 1979, the SBA shall only fund small business development center programs authorized by this Act. Stipulates that: (1) such restriction shall not apply in fiscal year 1980 to any center funded by the SBA before October 1, 1979; and (2) no such center funded in fiscal year 1978 may be funded in excess of $300,000 in fiscal year 1979."
