Authorizes the Attorney General to deport such aliens, and prohibits the Attorney General from allowing such aliens to voluntarily depart rather than being deported. Removes specified diplomatic and semidiplomatic immunities from such aliens. Makes it a felony under such Act to knowingly aid such an alien to enter the United States. Defines terrorist organization for purposes of such Act. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to: (1) define terrorist organization for purposes of such Act; (2) direct the Attorney General to investigate the activities of any person registered under such Act as an agent of a terrorist organization; and (3) make such an agent who knowingly receives funds from such an organization or who collects money in the United States for such an organization without filing a statement with the Attorney General, criminally liable."
