    "date": "1979-12-19", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in House H. Rept. 96-715) Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 - =Title I:= Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) establish a single system of measuring noise for which there is a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and the surveyed reactions of people to noise to be used to measure noise at airports and their surrounding areas; (2) establish a single system for determining the exposure of individuals to noise which results from the operations of an airport and which includes noise intensity, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence; and (3) identify land uses which are normally compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise. Allows airport operators to submit noise exposure maps prepared in consultation with public agencies and planning agencies in the area surrounding the airport to the Secretary setting forth the noncompatible uses in each area of the map, a description of the projected aircraft operations during 1985, and the ways in which such operations will affect such map. Requires the revision of such maps when changes in airport operations would create any new noncompatible use in areas surrounding an airport. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to authorize the Secretary to make grants to qualified airports for airport noise compatibility planning. Defines \"noise compatibility planning\" as the preparation of noise exposure maps and noise compatibility programs under this Act. Sets forth limitations regarding the amounts which may be obligated through such grant program. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for each fiscal year to carry out such grant program. Directs that noise compatibility programs be filed with the Secretary. Sets forth measures which may be included in such program, including: (1) the implementation of any preferential runway system; (2) the implementation of any restriction on the use of such airport by any type or class of aircraft based on the noise characteristics of such aircraft; (3) the construction of barriers and acoustical shielding, including the soundproofing of public buildings; (4) the use of flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft to reduce the impact of noise in the area surrounding the airport; and (5) acquisition of land and interests therein, including, but not limited to, air rights, easements, and development rights, so as to assure the use of property for purposes which are compatible with airport operations. Sets forth factors under which the Secretary may disapprove noise compatibility programs. Makes any failure to act on a program tacit approval of such program. Permits airport operators receiving grants to agree to make such grants available to public agencies. Stipulates that the Federal share of an approved program shall be 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes the Secretary to make additional grants to operators of airports and to units of local government for projects to carry out a noise compatibility program developed prior to the enactment of this Act or the promulgation of its implementing regulations under specified conditions. States that the approval of a program does not make the United States liable for damages from noise. Authorizes the Secretary to obligate not less than $25,000,000 out of funds available under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 for fiscal year 1980 to make such grants. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Federal Aviation Administration, after consultation with the officials of any public agencies or planning agencies, to prepare noise exposure maps and noise compatibility programs for specified airports near the District of Columbia. Provides that no part of any noise exposure map or related information and no part of the list of land uses that are normally compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise shall be admitted as evidence or used for other purposes in any suit or action seeking relief for airport noise. Limits suits for damages resulting from airport noise by individuals acquiring property in an area surrounding an airport for which a noise exposure map has been submitted. Presumes constructive knowledge of such map if notice of its existence was published at least three times in the county where such property is located or a copy of such map is furnished at the time such property is acquired. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the effectiveness of airport noise compatibility planning and programs which were funded pursuant to this Act. =Title II:= Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to increase specified appropriations authorized under such Act for fiscal year 1980. Increases the Federal share for specified airport development projects under such Act. Allows the use of funds from the unexpended balance of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to finance expenditures incurred under the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979. Waives the environmental impact statement requirement relating to noise for specified airport development projects which will allow airport usage by aircraft in compliance with the noise standards prescribed in this Act. Prohibits the construction or extension of any runway located within two counties of a single State without the prior approval of communities located within a specified radius of the airport. =Title III:= Directs the Secretary to require all air carriers and foreign air carriers engaging in foreign air transportation to meet specified noise standards if the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) does not adopt noise standards which are the same as or substantially similar to the noise standards prescribed for new subsonic aircraft in regulations issued by the Secretary which were in effect on January 1, 1977. Directs the FAA to require such carriers to comply with such regulations at a phased rate of compliance similar to that in effect for U.S. aircraft. Authorizes the Secretary to provide an exemption from applicable noise standards for noncomplying three-engine aircraft until January 1, 1985, and for noncomplying two-engine aircraft until January 1, 1986, if the operator has a plan and contract for the replacement of such aircraft by specified dates. Authorizes an exemption for specified two-engine aircraft with specified seating configurations until specified dates. Sets forth the factors the FAA is urged to consider in evaluating carrier compliance with the four-engine requirements of FAR 36 in specified hardship situations. =Title IV:= Directs the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress regarding the implementation of collision avoidance systems in the national air traffic control system. Exempts the employees of air carriers from the payment of income taxes to any State or subdivision thereof other than the State or subdivision of the employee's residence unless such employees earn more than 50 percent of their income in another State. =Title V:= Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to regulate the access to public areas by individuals or by religious and nonprofit organizations for the purpose of soliciting funds or distributing materials. Establishes criminal penalties for carrying deadly weapons or placing a bomb on board an aircraft. Prohibits any Federal agency from authorizing interstate air transportation of passengers to or from Love Field, Texas, except on a turnaround basis. Permits intrastate and limited commercial passenger service in interstate transportation at such airport."
