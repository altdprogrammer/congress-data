Authorizes the Commission to institute a civil action in any appropriate district court of the United States to request that the court enter such a cease and desist order. Directs the court to enter such order as it deems appropriate if it finds that the method of competition in question is prohibited by such Act and that enjoining the method serves the public interest."
