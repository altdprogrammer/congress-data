Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, to increase the interest yield on outstanding retirement bonds to make such yield consistent with the interest rates for new issues of such bonds. Makes technical amendments to several provisions of the Internal Revenue Code pertaining to General Stock Ownership Corporations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit employees of charitable organizations (other than private foundations) working in underdeveloped countries to elect, in lieu of the income tax deduction for excess foreign living costs, an income tax exclusion equal to $20,000. Sets forth arbitrage requirements for mortgage revenue bonds."
