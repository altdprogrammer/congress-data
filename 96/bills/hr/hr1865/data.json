States that such business should remain subject to State regulation and taxation. Establishes an exemption from the antitrust laws for the insurance business effective until February 1, 1980, but declares that such exemption shall not apply to any act or agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to propose rules for public comment which would exempt from the antitrust laws essential collective activities of the insurance business. Requires such rules to take effect no later than February 1, 1980."
