    "text": "Victims of Crime Act of 1979 - Establishes an Advisory Committee on Victims of Crime to advise the Attorney General with respect to the administration of this Act and the compensation of victims of crime. States that grants made under this Act shall total 25 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of State crimes designated by the State as appropriate for compensation under this program and 100 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of crimes which would constitute designated State crimes except for the fact that the crime is subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualifying State programs for the compensation of victims of crime. Requires that such programs: (1) offer compensation for personal injuries suffered as a result of qualifying State and Federal crimes; (2) offer compensation to surviving dependents of persons whose deaths resulted from such crimes; (3) grant claimants the right to a hearing; (4) require cooperation with law enforcement agencies as a condition for recovery; (5) do not require claimants to accept welfare benefits; and (6) require denial or reduction of a claim where the victim contributes to the injury suffered. Requires such States to have in effect laws which: (1) subrogate the State to any claim the victim or dependent has against the perpetrator to the extent of the amount compensated by the State; (2) provide for restitution by the perpetrator of the crime; (3) require proceeds earned for interviews or articles by an individual charged or convicted of a crime to be deposited in escrow for the benefits of the victim or dependents of such crime; and (4) require law enforcement agencies to take reasonable care to inform victims of qualifying crimes of compensation programs. Sets forth specified expenses that may not be included in the State program's cost of paying compensation when determining the amount of the grant for which such program is eligible. Directs the Attorney General to publish a report with respect to each qualifying State program, and the activities of the Attorney General in carrying out this Act."
