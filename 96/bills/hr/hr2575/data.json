    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #178 (314-72)) Department of Defense Supplemental Appropriation Authorization Act, 1979 - =Title I: Procurement= - Authorizes additional appropriations in specified amounts for use by the Air Force and Navy in fiscal year 1979 for the procurement of aircraft, missiles, and naval vessels. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1979 for the United States' share of the cost of the acquisition by NATO of the Airborne Early Warning and Control System as specified in the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Between NATO Ministers of Defense on the NATO E-3A Cooperative Programme. Specifies expenses for which the Secretary of Defense may waive reimbursement in carrying out the NATO E-3A Cooperative Programme. Permits the Secretary to assume contingent liability for identifiable taxes, duties, and other charges levied on the program within the United States and unfunded liability resulting from the termination of contracts. Declares that the authority to enter contracts in connection with the NATO E-3A Cooperative Programme shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent such amounts are provided in appropriations Acts. =Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation= - Authorizes additional appropriations for use during fiscal year 1979 by the Army and Air Force for research, development, test, and evaluation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that maintaining a survivable land-based intercontinental ballistic missile system is vital to the security of the United States. States that it is the sense of the Congress that the basing mode for the MX missile should be located on the least productive land available. Requires the Secretary to proceed immediately with the development of the Multiple Protective Structure missile basing mode, without restricting the study of alternate basing modes for land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles."
