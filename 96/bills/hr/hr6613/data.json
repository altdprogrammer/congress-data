Directs that certain collectively bargained fringe benefit assessment agreements shall be deemed approved upon filing with the Commission. Directs the Commission, upon complaint, to disapprove, cancel, or modify such agreements and to issue its final decision within one year of the date of filing of the complaint. Sets forth remedies for discrimination or unfairness in such agreements. Exempts maritime labor agreements (except for provisions dealing with fringe benefit obligations) from the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933."
