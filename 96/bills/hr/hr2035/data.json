Rept. 96-173) Amends the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982 to carry out cooperative programs with the States for the conservation, development, and enhancement of anadromous fish. Allows the use of Federal funds to operate and maintain multi-State common basin facilities constructed with funds under such Act. Declares that the title to lands or interests therein acquired under such Act shall be transferred to the State in which the lands are located, or in the case of a non-Federal party, to such party. Directs the Secretary of Interior to cooperate with States and other non-Federal interests in conducting studies of: (1) the size and distribution of the population of striped bass throughout its range; and (2) the factors responsible for the decline in the numbers of striped bass which are available to the public for recreational or commercial use. Directs the Secretary to make annual reports to Congress concerning the progress and findings of such studies. Authorizes additional appropriations for fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982 to carry out such studies."
