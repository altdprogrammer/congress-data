    "text": "Foreign Language Assistance Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to State educational agencies applying to reimburse local educational agencies for part of the costs of foreign language instruction for students in grades one through six, at a rate of $20 per student. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a survey of the effectiveness of foreign language training in grades seven through 12, and in community colleges; and (2) report to Congress within two years on the results of such survey. Directs the Secretary to make grants to applicant institutions of higher education as reimbursement for part of the costs of foreign language instruction. Conditions eligibility for such grants upon an institution's: (1) having more than five percent of its total number of students enrolled in qualified postsecondary language courses; and (2) meeting such standards and reporting requirements for assisted instructional programs as the Secretary may establish. Sets rates for such grants, per student beyond the minimum five percent of total enrollment, of $30 for first or second year language courses and $40 for courses above second-year level, with an additional $20 for less commonly taught languages. Directs the Secretary to make grants to each institution of higher education which requires at least two academic years of secondary school foreign language credits or knowledge of a foreign language for each graduating student, at a rate of $30 per number of students enrolled (as full-time students or the full-time equivalent of the number of part-time students) at such institution. Provides that grants under this Act shall be ratably reduced if sums appropriated are not sufficient for full payment. Prohibits the making of a grant, or entering into a contract, under this Act except to such extent, or in such amounts, as provided in appropriation Acts. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for fiscal year 1982."
