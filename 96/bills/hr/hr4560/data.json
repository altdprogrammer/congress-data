    "text": "Federal Salary Control Act of 1979 - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to prohibit any increase in the pay of a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives for any calendar year after 1986 if the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases by more than two percent for either of the two fiscal years immediately preceding such calendar year. Reduces the annual pay rate of members of Congress by a percentage of the rate of pay for the previous calendar year equal to the percentage increase in the CPI for the fiscal year ending during such previous calendar year. Stipulates that such a reduction in pay shall not take effect: (1) for any of calendar years 1982 through 1985 if the CPI does not increase by more than seven percent during each preceding fiscal year; and (2) for any calendar year after 1985 which is preceded by a fiscal year in which the CPI does not increase by over two percent. Declares that the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress shall not be reduced to less than $42,500. Sets forth similar provisions regarding pay reductions and increases for employees of the executive branch who are appointed by the President or the head of an executive department and whose annual pay equals or exceeds $40,000. Prohibits the reduction of the annual pay rate for such employees to less than $32,500."
