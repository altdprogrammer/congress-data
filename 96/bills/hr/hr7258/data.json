    "text": "Paperwork Elimination and Control Act of 1980 - Includes independent regulatory agencies within the definition of the term \"agency\" for purposes of provisions of Federal law regarding the coordination of Federal reporting services. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to provide for increased communication between the Government and the small business community with respect to Federal information collection activities. Directs the Director to require each agency to include on each of its information collection forms: (1) the expiration date of such form; (2) a registration number; (3) a statement as to whether the information collection is required by law, voluntary, or a requirement for obtaining a benefit administered by the agency; and (4) the name and toll-free telephone number of an agency representative who shall be designated by the agency head to provide assistance concerning the agency's information collection activities. Requires the Director to consult with the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and to establish guidelines which provide for: (1) differing information collection requirements that take into account the resources available to small businesses; (2) exemptions to small businesses from certain requirements; and (3) consolidated or simplified requirements for small businesses. Requires the Director to develop and maintain a Federal Business Requirements Locator System to serve as the authoritative register of all Government information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Directs the Director to: (1) promulgate rules requiring each agency head to submit a data profile of each existing and proposed information collection and recordkeeping requirement; (2) compare submitted data profiles to profiles in the System and notify agency officials and members of the public, upon request, of the results; and (3) provide any person, upon request, with a list of requirements applicable to a certain type of business. Requires the use of data profiles to: (1) identify duplicative requirements; (2) locate existing information and promote agency sharing of information; (3) provide a central coordination mechanism for information collection activities; (4) catalog requirements by types of industries; and (5) monitor the total requirements imposed on the public by the Government so that such paperwork may be reduced. Directs the head of each agency to submit, annually, an analysis of the agency's information collection activities to the Director with the agency's request for appropriations submitted under the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921. Requires the Director to publish in the Federal Register: (1) a summary of such analysis with a notice soliciting public comments; (2) a summary of comments received; and (3) a statement explaining the Director's determination regarding any issue raised by a comment disagreeing with data or conclusions of the analysis."
