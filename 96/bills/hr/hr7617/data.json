Limits such additional leases to no more than 6,400 acres. Provides that such land be used for any purposes, except mining, that the Secretary of Interior allows. Prohibits mining oil shale under such leases. Requires the lessee to show to the Secretary's satisfaction that the lessee needs the additional land and has the ability to conduct environmentally safe operations. Requires the Secretary's determination that the additional lease is in the public interest. Establishes guidelines for other lease provisions including rent and duration."
