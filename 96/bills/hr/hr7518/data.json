    "text": "Labor Statistic Respondent Privacy Protection Act of 1980 - Prohibits any employee of the Bureau of Labor Statistics from disclosing data requested under a pledge of confidentiality in connection with a statistical program which could reasonably be uniquely associated with the identity of any individual or establishment to which the data pertains, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner. Prohibits such data from being used to determine any right, privilege, benefit, or penalty, or to facilitate any investigation of an individual or establishment. Makes these provisions inapplicable to the use or disclosure by a State agency of data collected in accordance with a cooperative statistical program conducted jointly by the State and the Bureau. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Bureau to transfer data collected under a pledge of confidentiality to another Federal agency for statistical purposes only, in which event the protections of this Act shall continue in effect. Authorizes the Commissioner to set forth regulations establishing exceptions to the protections of this Act if the respondents are informed of the use or disclosure at the time the data is requested and a compelling public interest exists. Permits a respondent to waive the provisions of this Act in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner. Permits the Commissioner to make such waivers with respect to data collected at least 72 years prior to such waiver. Exempts from disclosure under any Federal, State, or local law (including the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts) and immunizes from legal process: (1) submissions exempt from disclosure under this Act; and (2) all data in the possession of any Federal, State, or local agency derived from data submitted to the Bureau under a pledge of confidentiality which could reasonably be uniquely associated with the identity of any individual or establishment. Subjects violators of this Act to a civil fine and/or debarment from participation in any statistical grant or contract with the Department of Labor."
