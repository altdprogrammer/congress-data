Declares that it shall be the policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with other nations and in partnership with the States, local governments, Indian tribes, and private organizations and individuals, to: (1) use measures to foster conditions under which our modern society and our prehistoric and historic resources can exist in productive harmony; (2) provide leadership in the preservation of the prehistoric and historic resources of the United States and of the international community of nations; (3) administer federally owned, administered, or controlled prehistoric and historic resources; (4) contribute to the preservation of nonfederally owned prehistoric and historic resources; (5) encourage the public and private preservation and utilization of all usable elements of the Nation's environment; and (6) assist State and local governments and the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States to expand and accelerate their historic preservation programs and activities. =Title II: Historic Preservation Program= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to expand and maintain a National Register of Historic Places composed of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture.
