Declares that such estimate need not include an estimate of funding to defray the costs of development, demonstration, testing, or evaluation of the Department of Defense. Requires the President to transmit such estimate to Congress as part of the annual budget submission in each odd-numbered calendar year. Requires the President to transmit to Congress, from time to time as appropriate (previously annually), a Science and Technology Report which shall be prepared by the Office of Science and Technology Policy with such assistance from the Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities as the Director of such Office may find necessary. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to require the National Science Foundation to submit annually to the President for transmittal to the Congress an analysis of all Federal research and development funding by function."
