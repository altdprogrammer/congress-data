    "text": "Underutilized Species Development Act of 1979 - Allows any citizen of the United States to apply to the Secretary of the Department in which the National Marine Fisheries Service is located for approval of an underutilized specie development plan. Authorizes the Secretary to approve such plan if it is determined that it will facilitate the development of an underutilized specie or species. Subjects any vessels used in the training of fishermen and crew pursuant to an underutilized specie development plan and which operates in the fisheries of the United States within the territorial zone and lands any catch in the United States to specified terms and conditions. Prohibits the Secretary from approving: (1) any plan where its approval would result in the applicant and its affiliates having in effect underutilized specie development plans pursuant to which training vessels would harvest a catch equal to more than 20 percent of the total allowable level of foreign fishing established for any specie at the time of such application; or (2) any plan that would result in there being in effect plans pursuant to which training vessels would harvest a catch equal to more than 50 percent of the total allowable level of foreign fishing established for any specie at the time of such application. Declares that fish harvested by a training vessel shall be deemed fish harvested by United States vessels and the total allowable level of foreign fishing shall be reduced accordingly. Allows the maximum allowable catch permitted to be harvested by an applicant and its affiliates to be increased by ten percent of the total allowable level of foreign fishing established for any specie at the time of application whenever all of the training vessels of an applicant have their home port in a State, territory, district or possession of the United States with an unemployment rate equal to or in excess of 8.5 percent."
