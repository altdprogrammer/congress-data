    "text": "Administrative Procedure Reform Act of 1979 - Repeals the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act which permits agencies to refuse to hold a public hearing on a decision on the basis that such a hearing is impracticable where one would otherwise be required. Gives any interested party a right to present an oral argument at any hearing subject to the Act. Repeals other specified exemptions from the public notice and hearing provisions of the Act and extends from 30 days to 90 days the length of time which must pass between public notice of and the actual holding of a hearing conducted pursuant to the Act. Grants any person the right without charge to a copy of the transcript of any portion of an administrative hearing which deals with evidence submitted by such person. Prohibits any Federal official from entering upon private property for inspection or seizure of evidence without a search warrant. Directs the evidence be admitted at an administrative hearing only pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence. Permits agencies to impose sanctions on a person only if such person has been given at least 30 days to correct the violation on which such sanction is based. Grants any such person the right to confront and cross-examine any adverse witness and rebut all evidence concerning such alleged violation. Requires a copy of all proposed rules of Federal agencies to be sent to Congress. States that such rule, other than an emergency rule, shall not become effective if it is disapproved within 90 days by both Houses of Congress, or it is disapproved within 60 days by one House and no action is taken on the disapproval resolution by the other House. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for consideration of such resolutions. States that judicial review of agency decisions shall be had without requiring the appellant to exhaust administrative remedies. Permits de novo trials of appealed issues."
