    "text": "Taxpayer's Litigation and Equity Award Act of 1979 - Awards reasonable court costs, including attorneys' fees, to a prevailing party in any civil action for the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, interest, penalty, or other matter arising under the Internal Revenue Code. Requires the Internal Revenue Service to reimburse the reasonable expenses of a taxpayer who prevails in any administrative proceeding. Limits the amount of such awards to $20,000. Permits awards in excess of such amount only if the taxpayer can show that his costs are computed on the basis of the costs expended by or allocable to the United States in prosecuting such case, and that the assets of such taxpayer do not exceed $1,000,000 at the time such action began. Includes within the term \"fees and other expenses\" the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the prevailing party's case, and reasonable attorney or agent fees. Grants discretion to a court to reduce or increase a claim for reimbursement under specified conditions. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the appropriate officer of the United States Tax Court, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to submit to Congress a report on the amount of fees and expenses awarded during the preceding fiscal year pursuant to the terms of this Act. Specifies that the terms of this Act shall apply to civil actions or proceedings filed after December 31, 1978, and before January 1, 1985."
