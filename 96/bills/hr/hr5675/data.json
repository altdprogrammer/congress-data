    "text": "Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to change the criteria for establishing national primary drinking water regulations from requiring that such regulations specify contaminants \"which pose a substantial health hazard.\" Makes such amendment applicable only to primary drinking water regulations promulgated or amended after November 1, 1979. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study of any health effects which result from exposure to barium, barium ion, radium, or any combination thereof, in concentrations greater than the maximum level specified in the interim regulations. Requires that a report of such study be submitted to Congress. Directs the Administrator to promulgate a revised national primary drinking water regulation for such substances following completion of such study. Exempts from the application of such regulation any drinking water system which serves an area in which barium, barium ion, or radium from natural sources exceeds the maximum contaminant level specified in such regulation."
