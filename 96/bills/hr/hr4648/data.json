    "text": "Utility Lifeline Act of 1979 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require State regulatory authorities and nonregulated utilities to establish uniform minimum amounts of electric energy and natural gas necessary to supply the essential needs of residential consumers, schools, and hospitals during any billing period. Stipulates that no utility's rate schedule for such amounts shall exceed the lowest rate charged by such utility for any equivalent amount of electric energy or natural gas sold during such period for use by any other customer or class or category of customers. Permits utilities to establish higher rates for that portion of electric energy or natural gas which exceeds the minimum amounts established under this Act. Prohibits electric and natural gas utilities from imposing rates or charges for electric energy or natural gas sold to retail consumers other than those for which minimum amounts of electric energy or natural gas are established which rates or charges exceed by more than 12 percent the charges which would be applicable to such sales if such charges were based on the cost of providing such service, with exceptions. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue an order establishing the amounts of electric energy or gas specified by this Act for essential needs in the event a utility fails to establish such amounts, and requires such utility to establish rates or charges for such amounts which meet the requirements of this Act. Authorizes judicial review of the Commission's action in setting minimum amounts of electric energy or gas for essential needs, but prohibits courts conducting such reviews from a State regulatory authority's rate determination relating to such amounts, except as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Stipulates that in the case of provisions of this Act applicable to electric utilities, nothing under such provisions shall be construed to prohibit the adoption of time-of-day and seasonal rates to the extent that such rates are consistent with this Act. Makes conforming amends to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978."
