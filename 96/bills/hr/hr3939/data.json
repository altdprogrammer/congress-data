Prohibits the investment of assets of the funds in obligations issued or guaranteed in whole or in part by the government of the District of Columbia, the government of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the government of the State of Maryland, or the government of any political subdivision thereof, or in obligations secured by real property in the District of Columbia, Virginia, or Maryland. Directs the Board to engage an enrolled actuary to determine, in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices, the level percentage of payroll required to be paid into the Fund, considering length of participation in the retirement program and the present value of future benefits. Sets forth formulae to determine annual Federal Payments and annual District of Columbia payments to each Fund. Reduces the Federal share of such Funds from 100 percent to 75 percent. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums from the revenues of the United States and from amounts in the United States Treasury credited to the District of Columbia contributions to each Fund, respectively.

Directs the Board to prepare summary retirement program descriptions to be supplied to each participant in, and beneficiary under, each retirement program to which this Act applies. Requires that annual reports and copies of summary retirement program descriptions, including periodic updates containing material modification, be filed with the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Council, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President pro tempore of the Senate. Empowers the Mayor, the Council, or either House of Congress to reject any filing upon making specified findings. Suspends Federal contributions to any Fund with respect to which a filing is rejected or no timely filing has been made pending an acceptable filing. Requires that copies of such reports and descriptions be made available for public inspection. Designates the Board and each member of the Board fiduciaries with respect to the Funds.

Prohibits any person convicted of specified crimes from serving as an administrator, fiduciary, counsel, or employee of, or as a consultant to, the Fund established by this Act within five years of any such conviction or release from imprisonment, unless the Board of Parole of the United States determines that such person's service with the Fund would not be contrary to the purposes of this Act. Requires every fiduciary of a Fund established by this Title and every person who handles its funds to be bonded. Sets forth criminal penalties for violation of fiduciary obligations. Creates civil causes of action for the benefit of specified plaintiffs to enforce the provisions of this Act. Specifies time limits within which civil action grounded on breach of fiduciary duty must be brought. =Title II: Changes in Retirement Benefits= - Revises the method for determining the salary base period for computation of annuities of participants in the District of Columbia Policemen and Fire Fighters' Retirement Fund. Permits any member or officer of the Metropolitan Police or Fire Department who is on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time official of an employee organization to have such service credited towards his retirement upon meeting specific requirements.
