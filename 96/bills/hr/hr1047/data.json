    "text": "Citizens' Right to Standing in Federal Courts Act - Prohibits a Federal court from dismissing an action brought against the Federal, State, or local governments, or entities or officers of such governments, based upon a violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, on the ground that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue because: (1) the alleged injury is shared by a large class of persons; (2) the defendant's conduct is not the primary cause of the injury; or (3) such injury is not substantially likely to be remedied or prevented by a determination on the merits in the plaintiff's favor, if such determination may contribute in significant part to remedying or preventing such injury. States that such prohibition shall not affect the standing or lack of standing of a taxpayer plaintiff. Precludes the raising of a standing challenge on appeal except as may be required by Article III of the Constitution."
