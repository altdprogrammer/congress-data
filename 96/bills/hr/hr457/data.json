    "text": "Requires that whoever uses or carries a firearm during the commission of a felony over which a Federal court has original and exclusive jurisdiction, or whoever uses or carries a firearm transported in, or affecting, interstate or foreign commerce during the commission of any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term over one year and is convicted of such crime in a State court, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such crime, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five nor more than ten years. Requires in the case of a second or subsequent conviction the imposition of a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years, or of life imprisonment. Stipulates that the execution or imposition of any term of imprisonment under this Act: (1) may not be suspended; (2) may not run concurrently; and (3) may not include probation. Requires the purchaser of any firearm, who does not appear in person at a licensed dealer's business premise, to be 18-years-old, rather than 21-years-old, as currently required for purchasing any firearm other than a shotgun or rifle. Eliminates the requirement that licensed importers, manufacturers, dealers, or collectors keep records on ammunition sold or delivered to any person."
