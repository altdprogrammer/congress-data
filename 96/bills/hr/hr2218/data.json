    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to authorize appropriations to carry out the purpose of such Act during fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to make decisions concerning determinations of endangered or threatened species based on data obtained after conducting a review of the status of the species. Revises the notification provisions applicable to regulations issued pursuant to this Act. Requires the Secretary to establish agency procedures to ensure that the determinations of endangered or threatened species are achieved. Requires Federal agencies to insure that agency actions are not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species, using the best scientific and commercial data available. Requires such agencies to confer with the Secretary concerning actions which may jeopardize endangered or threatened species. Permits anyone seeking an exemption for an agency action to conduct a biological assessment to identify endangered or threatened species likely to be affected by such actions. Revises the procedure for considering applications for such exemptions. Stipulates that grants of such exemption shall be permanent, even if the species was not identified in the required biological assessment. Specifies exceptions to such permanent grant of exemption. Repeals the provision making it unlawful for fish or wildlife importers or exporters to fail to file any required reports. Designates the Secretary as the Management Authority and the Scientific Authority for purposes of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, acting through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Establishes within such Service the Endangered Species Scientific Authority Commission to make recommendations concerning the responsibilities of the Scientific Authority. Directs the President to designate those Federal agencies that shall act for and represent the United States as required by the Convention on Nature Protection and Wilderness Preservation in the Western Hemisphere. Allows any person to whom an exemption certificate for endangered species parts (sperm whale oil or finished scrimshaw product) has been issued pursuant to this Act to apply to the Secretary for a renewal of such exemption for a period not to exceed three years. Declares that if such a renewal is granted all terms, conditions, prohibitions, and other regulations made applicable by the original certificate shall remain in effect during the renewal period. Includes plants within the protection provisions of this Act. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 to enable the Department of Agriculture to enforce this Act and the Convention with regard to the importation and exportation of terrestrial plants."
