    "date": "1979-04-04", 
    "text": "Repeals provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which require tax-exempt private foundations with assets of $5,000 or more to make annual reports of their receipts and expenditures. Requires that information previously required by such annual reports be included in the foundation's annual tax return. Imposes the same reporting requirements on non tax-exempt charitable trusts and private foundations. Requires that such returns be opened to public inspection and imposes a fine for failure to do so. Permits private foundations to treat as confidential, and not to list on their tax returns, the name and address of any indigent or needy recipient of charitable gifts or grants amounting to $1,000 or less during the taxable year."
