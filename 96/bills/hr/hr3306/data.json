Stipulates that such certificates shall constitute part of the general reserve and net worth of the association. Directs the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to issue rules and regulations authorizing the sale of such certificates. Specifies that losses shall be charged against such certificates only after other reserve and net worth accounts have been exhausted. Requires the approval of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation before payment of interest shall be made on such mutual capital certificates and debentures in the event an insured institution fails to maintain the required reserves."
