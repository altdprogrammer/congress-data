Directs the President to establish a reserve stock of wheat of up to 4,000,000 metric tons. Authorizes the President to release such stocks on a donation or sale basis to provide emergency food assistance to developing countries at any time that domestic supply of wheat in the United States is so limited that quantities cannot be made available except for urgent humanitarian purposes. Authorizes the release of up to 300,000 tons of wheat in any fiscal year for urgent humanitarian relief in a developing country (or countries) suffering a major disaster. Exempts such reserve stocks from limitations which may be imposed under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 and the Export Administration Act of 1969."
