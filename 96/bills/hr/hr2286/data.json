Specifies the amount of an individual's earned income and work-related expenses which shall be allowed in determining the amount of earned income to be attributed to an individual in determining the amount of such individual's Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits. Establishes a criminal penalty for fraud related to the application for and use of Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits. Stipulates that the Federal share of the expense of a State in investigating and prosecuting fraud shall be 75 percent of such expense, under title IV and under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act.
