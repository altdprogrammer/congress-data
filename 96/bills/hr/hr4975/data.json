    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Establishes the Orange Coast National Urban Park in the Irvine Coast - Laguna area of California to protect the area's ecology and topography and for public outdoor recreation and use. Declares that it is the intent of Congress that all the property within the park be acquired by December 31, 1984, and that any lands, or interests therein not acquired by that date shall not longer be deemed included in the park. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to the property acquired pursuant to this Act, to: (1) convey the property to the State of California or any political subdivision thereof, subject to such terms, conditions, and reversionary provisions as will assure preservation of the property for public park or open-space purposes; and (2) enter into an agreement with the State or a political subdivision thereof pursuant to which the State or such subdivision shall administer, protect, and manage the property for public park or open-space purposes. Authorizes the Secretary, with specified exceptions, to acquire lands and interests therein within the boundaries of the park by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange, or otherwise. Requires the Secretary to take such actions as may be necessary to convey and transfer for purposes of the proposed San Joaquin Hills transportation corridor and the proposed Sand Canyon Road such rights-of-way through the park as may be necessary for the establishment of such corridor and/or road. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to expeditiously take such actions as are required to construct the portion of such transportation corridor as is within the boundaries of the park."
