Requires that the deed of conveyance of such property provide that the property shall be used for the purpose for which it was conveyed in perpetuity or, at the Secretary's option, it shall revert to the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, subject to the disapproval of the Administrator, to: (1) enforce compliance with the terms of any instrument governing such transfer; (2) reform any such instrument; (3) grant releases from any of the terms of such an instrument; or (4) convey to the transferee any right or interest reserved to the United States by such an instrument upon determining that such conveyance shall not prevent the accomplishment of the purpose of the transfer."
