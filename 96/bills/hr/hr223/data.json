Authorizes any agency to provide by rule for abridged proceedings. Authorizes the Administrative Conference of the United States to establish a Committee on Uniform Rules. Authorizes such Committee to draft uniform procedural rules to be binding on all Federal agencies if not disapproved by a majority of the Conference. Prohibits the publication by any agency of any information which relates to an agency investigation or proceeding if such information contains prejudicial bias or may otherwise harm any person in his business, property, or reputation. Requires, in the event that an agency is about to publish information which may reasonably be expected to cause such damage, that such agency inform the possibly adversely affected person 72 hours before such publication to afford such person an opportunity to obtain an injunction prohibiting such publication."
