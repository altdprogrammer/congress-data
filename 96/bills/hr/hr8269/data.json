    "text": "Coal Utilization Incentives Act of 1980 - Title I: Balancing Energy and Environmental Policies - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a cost-benefit analysis on any proposed national ambient air quality standards with an emphasis on the impact of any proposed modification in any standard on the use of domestic coal. Prohibits, for a ten-year period, subject to any more stringent emission limitation or standard of performance of: (1) any existing major stationary source which comes into compliance with all emission limitations in the applicable implementation plan; or (2) any new or modified applicable emission limitations and standards of performance. Sets such ten-year period to run from the date of completion of such compliance, construction, or modification, or during the period of depreciation or amortization of such facility for Internal Revenue Code purposes, whichever period ends first. Exempts from the application of this Act any source to which a substantial imminent threat to public health can be attributed, as determined by the Administrator. Authorizes the President to issue to any fuel-burning stationary source a temporary emergency suspension of any part of an applicable implementation plan adopted by a State in the event the President determines that: (1) a national or regional emergency exists involving high levels of unemployment or loss of necessary energy supplies for residential dwellings; (2) such unemployment or loss can be alleviated by such emergency suspension; and (3) foreign imports of fuels used by such source have reached an excessive level which can be reduced by such suspension. Extends the duration of such emergency suspensions from a maximum of four months to five years or such longer period as the owner or operator of such source may establish as reasonable, except that such suspension is limited in duration to a maximum of four months if it would result in violation of any national ambient air quality standard. Authorizes the Administrator to specify a date not later than December 31, 1983, for final compliance with an applicable State implementation plan by a major stationary source which burns petroleum products and/or natural gas and which: (1) is prohibited from doing so by an order under the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974; (2) gives notice of intent to convert to coal as a primary fuel because of actual or anticipated curtailment of natural gas supplies; or (3) gives notice of intent to voluntarily convert to coal as a primary fuel. Extends to July 1, 1981, the deadline for revision of any applicable implementation plan for which an attainment date later than December 31, 1982, has been granted by the Administrator to include comprehensive public transportation measures. Directs any State agency evaluating a permit request for any stationary source proposing to use coal as a fuel to prepare a cost-benefit analysis on the environmental costs and economic benefits of such proposal. Exempts from the penalty for noncompliance with an emission limitation or standard or other requirement under the Clean Air Act the owner or operator of a source the noncompliance of which is due to the use of coal as a primary energy source where the only alternative is to use oil, natural gas, or other nonrenewable forms of energy. Eliminates the maximum increases in sulphur dioxide and particulate matter concentration allowed for a 24-hour period or for a three-hour period. Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit the amortization of coal utilization property, based on a 36-month period. Defines \"coal utilization property\" as tangible, depreciable property which is: (1) a boiler or burner the primary fuel for which will be coal; or (2) pollution control equipment required for such boiler or burner. Allows an investment tax credit to public utilities for coal utilization property. Qualifies coal utilization property for the full investment tax credit allowed for pollution control facilities with a useful life of not less than five years."
