Prohibits the synthetic fuel so transferred from being treated as alternate fuel, but allows the petroleum or natural gas involved in the exchange to be treated as alternate fuel upon submission of appropriate documentation and certification to the Secretary of Energy. Requires persons utilizing such exchange to report annually to the Secretary describing the source, amount, quality, and point of delivery of the synthetic fuel and the petroleum or natural gas involved."
