Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land or interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. Specifies that the owner or owners of any improved residential property or agricultural property acquired by the Secretary may retain a right of use and occupancy of the property for noncommercial residential or for agricultural purposes, as the case may be, for: (1) a definite term of not more than 25 years; or (2) a term ending at the death of the owner or owners. Allows the Secretary to lease land owned by the United States which has been acquired by the Secretary under this Act and which was agricultural land immediately before such acquisition. Subjects such leases to such conditions and restrictions as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Withdraws the lands within the monument, subject to valid existing rights, from entry or appropriation under the mining laws of the United States and from the operation of the mineral leasing laws of the United States."
