Stipulates that a writ of habeas corpus shall be granted on behalf of a person in custody under a State court judgment only if: (1) any of the grounds of such applications were not considered in the State court proceedings and the lack of such consideration (A) was not caused by the action of such applicant and (B) was prejudicial to such person; and (2) the application is made within three years of the date the judgment became final. Revises the standards governing proceedings in Federal court for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody under a State court judgment."
