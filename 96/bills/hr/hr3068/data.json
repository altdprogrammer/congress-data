    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow handicapped individuals a nonrefundable income tax credit for 20 percent of their commuting expenses for a taxable year. Limits the amount of commuting expenses which may be taken into account for the credit to $5,000. Reduces the amount of commuting expenses eligible for the credit by one-half of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $20,000. Defines a \"handicapped individual\" as an individual who is blind or has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last continuously for at least 12 months and which prevents the individual from using public transportation. Defines \"commuting expenses\" as expenses for the transportation of a handicapped individual between his residence and his principal place of employment."
