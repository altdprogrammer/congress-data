    "text": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to waive specified requirements for the use of title I special educational needs funds by local educational agencies participating in experimental programs designed to consolidate State categorical educational programs. Permits such waiver for any one of fiscal years 1982 through 1985, with possible renewal for an additional one-year period, of requirements that: (1) such Federal funds be used to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds for regular and certain special State and local programs; and (2) agencies receiving Federal assistance maintain, through use of non- Federal funds, services comparable to those provided by unassisted agencies. Prohibits the Secretary's approval of a waiver application unless it contains the following assurances plus an assurance that not more than 15 percent of the State's educationally deprived children shall be served under the experimental program. Requires an assurance, in the case of any waiver which enables local educational agencies to consolidate the administration and operation of programs for educationally deprived children and special education programs for handicapped children and for children with limited English-speaking ability, that the educationally deprived children in project areas will be provided with educational programs and services which are comparable to those such children would otherwise receive and that certain Federal funds shall be used to provide programs and services only to eligible children. Requires an assurance, in the case of any waiver which permits local educational agencies to transfer State and local funds among the special educational programs described above and programs for educationally deprived children, that the educationally deprived children shall receive the same level of Federal funds as they would receive in the absence of such waiver and that an accurate accounting of such funds is ensured. Requires an assurance, in the case of any waiver permitting local educational agencies to distribute State and local funds for the programs under this title to project areas and other school attendance areas, that the educationally deprived children at elementary and secondary schools in project areas receive a level of State and local funds not less than, and services from such funds comparable to, the level of such funds and the services from such funds received by elementary and secondary school children in other school attendance areas. Permits a waiver which enables local educational agencies to use funds available for programs under this title to improve educational programs for eligible children who have not met the requirements for grade promotion or for receipt of a high school diploma or to provide educational services to eligible children when required by applicable law or court order."
