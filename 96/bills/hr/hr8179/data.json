    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-09-22", 
    "text": "Increases the standard deferred premium which may be charged a licensee of a nuclear facility following a nuclear incident. Requires such premiums to be paid in equal installments over a period between one and five years. Increases the amount of indemnification the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may provide a licensee or a Federal contractor to $5,000,000,000. Reduces such indemnity by an amount equal to all of the financial protection required of a licensee or contractor. Limits the public liability for a single nuclear incident, involving facilities which received a construction permit before a specified date, to the required financial protection and applicable indemnity. Requires the exhaustion of such protection and indemnity before payment of damages from any source except the required financial protection may be made in the case of facilities which received a construction permit after such specified date. Increases the annual fee which the Commission may charge for an indemnification agreement from $30 to $1,000. Authorizes the Commission to return any portion of a collected fee after ten years. Requires the Commission to survey the cause and extent of damage of each nuclear incident regardless of the extent of public liability. Increases the indemnity for a licensee operating as a nonprofit educational institution to $5,000,000,000. Authorizes the Commission to require any person who it indemnifies to waive certain defenses to liability with respect to any nuclear incident (under existing law such waivers may be obtained only with respect to extraordinary nuclear occurrences). Increases the period of time within which a suit may be brought pursuant to a waiver of any statute of limitations to 40 years from the date of a nuclear incident. Sets forth the priority of claims for damages by owners or operators of nuclear facilities. Requires the 1983 Commission report to the Congress to contain recommendations concerning liability issues, specifically those relating to proof of causation and proper elements of damages. Directs the Commission to promulgate regulations to implement the amendments made by this Act within one year after enactment."
