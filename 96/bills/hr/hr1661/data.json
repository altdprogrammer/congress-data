    "text": "Limits the power of any United States court to issue school transportation orders based on race, color, or national origin by requiring a determination that a discriminatory, educational purpose was a principal motivating factor in the constitutional violation for which such transportation is proposed as a remedy. Requires the holding of a special hearing where specific findings in relation to such a constitutional violation must be made before a school assignment order may issue. Stays such school assignment orders until all appeals have been exhausted, except that a majority of the Supreme Court or a majority of a court of appeals (of not less than three members) may vacate such stay. Provides guidelines for an appeal from such stay."
