Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans, not to individually exceed $15,000,000, for each of twenty plants to be constructed for such purposes by public, private, or cooperative organization. Amends the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 to expand the range of activities for which alcohol and industrial hydrocarbon production and marketing research grants may be made, to include research in solid waste and forest product and research relating to the identification and development of by-products from such production."
