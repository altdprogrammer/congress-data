    "text": "(Measure failed of passage in House, roll call #591 (158-249)) International Sugar Stabilization Act of 1979 - =Title I: International Sugar Agreement, 1977= - Authorizes the President until January 1, 1983, to implement the International Sugar Agreement by: (1) regulating the entry of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization; and (2) requiring records and reports concerning the entry of sugar. Establishes criminal penalties for violating such regulations. Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual report on the Agreement. =Title II: Import Restrictions on Sugar= - Establishes 15.8 cents per pound, raw value, as the price objective for the 1979 sugar supply year. Sets forth the formula for determining the price objective for succeeding years. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor the average daily price of sugar imports. Directs the Secretary to pay up to one-half per pound, raw value, solely to domestic producers of sugar beets and sugarcane to assure a return of 16.3 cents per pound, raw value, during the 1979 sugar supply year (to be readjusted in succeeding years as the price objective is readjusted). Limits the total amount of such payments to any producer, to $50,000. Imposes a special import duty in the amount by which the average daily price for sugar is less than the price objective. Provides for the readjustment of such duties. Authorizes the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary, to: (1) impose special import duties on sugar-containing products; and (2) make any necessary adjustments in any special import duties. Requires the President to request an investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission to determine whether the entry of sugar-containing products is adversely affecting the achievement of the price objective before imposing any special duty on such products unless it is an emergency. Requires the President to impose quotas on imports of sugar and sugar containing products whenever the Secretary determines that the price objective will not be achieved by the special import duties alone. Directs the Secretary to periodically review and recommend readjustments of such quotas. Prohibits the importation of more than 100 pounds of sugar annually into the Virgin Islands. Prohibits the exportation of certain sugar. Establishes penalties for violations of such regulations. Exempts certain sugar or sugar-containing products from this title. Specifies that certain sugar entered for subsequent export shall not be charged against any proclaimed quota. Authorizes the President to suspend the operation of this title in a national emergency. Provides penalties for violations of this section. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to permit the President to proclaim special import duties and quotas on sugars, syrups, and molasses in order to carry out this Act. Terminates the authority under this title at the end of the 1981 sugar supply year. =Title III: Farm Labor Provisions= - Requires every producer of sugar beets and sugarcane to pay each employee a specified minimum wage. Prohibits any producer from charging more than the reasonable costs of furnishing customary goods or services to employees. Prohibits employing children under the age of 14 in the production, cultivation, or harvesting of sugar beets or sugarcane. Limits the amount of time children between the ages of 14 and 16 may be so employed. Prohibits any producer from discriminating against any employee who has participated in an investigation or proceeding under this title. Requires producers to furnish workmen's compensation insurance to employees. Makes the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 applicable to violations of the provisions in this Title concerning wage standards, child labor, employee protection, and record-keeping requirements. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to seek to restrain violations of the provisions in this Title concerning excessive charges and compensation insurance. Requires producers to keep records and report to the Secretary of Labor as necessary. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for violating provisions in this Title concerning excessive charges and compensation insurance. =Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Vests jurisdiction for enforcing this Act in U.S. district courts. Requires all persons engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, transporting, or industrial use of sugar and other sweeteners to furnish the Secretary with necessary information. Prohibits officials engaged in the administration of this Act from investing or speculating in sugar. Establishes penalties for violating these regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct surveys and investigations to carry out this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct studies on the cost of producing sugar beets, sugarcane, sugar, and other sweeteners. Extends the price support program for sugar beets and sugarcane through the 1981 sugar supply year. Sets such price supports at not less than 89 percent of the sugar price objective. Authorizes the Secretary to waive part of the interest to encourage repayment of Commodity Credit Corporation loans with respect to the 1977 and 1978 crops of sugar beets and sugarcane. Designates the Commodity Corporation as the entity responsible for administering the authority vested in the Secretary under the Act. Authorizes the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide loan guarantees for construction, conversion, or modification of facilities deriving industrial hydrocarbons and alcohols from sugar cane, sugar beets, corn or their by-products. Stipulates that such loan guarantees are: (1) to be made in the two fiscal years beginning October 1, 1979, from a fund of up to $25,000,000; and (2) not to exceed the amount of special import duties collected under this Act in such period."
