Revises funding provisions applicable to the Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund (for workers), firm adjustment assistance, and the Community Adjustment Assistance Fund to authorize appropriations to such funds in amounts equal to the import fees collected pursuant to this Act plus any additional sums necessary to provide such adjustment assistance."
