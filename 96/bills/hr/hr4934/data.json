    "text": "Criminal Fines Reform Act of 1979 - Redefines a petty offense as a misdemeanor with a penalty not exceeding six months imprisonment or a fine of $2,500 (currently, six months imprisonment or a $500 fine). Adds to the general provisions of the Federal criminal code a new section relating to the amount and imposition of fines. Stipulates that any offense punishable by imprisonment shall be punishable by imprisonment, a fine, or both. Sets forth: (1) a fine schedule which correlates maximum fines which can be imposed upon an individual to specified maximum terms of imprisonment; and (2) the maximum fines which may be imposed upon a person, other than an individual, upon conviction of a Federal crime. Allows a person who derives pecuniary gain in the commission of an offense to be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding twice such gain. Enumerates factors which the court must consider in determining the amount of a fine. Allows the court to remit and modify the terms of payment of a fine upon a finding that the defendant has become unable to pay the fine due to circumstances beyond his or her control, but disallows such discretion with respect to a fine imposed upon conviction of an offense punishable by imprisonment and a fine or in any case where the court lacks proper authority."
