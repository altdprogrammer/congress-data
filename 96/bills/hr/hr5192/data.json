    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-1337) Education Amendments of 1980 - =Title I: Establishment of a New Title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965= - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a new title I: \"Continuing Postsecondary Education Program and Planning.\" Establishes a Commission on National Development in Postsecondary Education to review the effectiveness of policies to promote specified Federal responsibilities in the area of postsecondary education (including use of Federal student assistance to recruit and retain members of the Armed Forces) and to submit a final report to the President and the Congress by December 31, 1983. Terminates the Commission 60 days after submission of the final report. Authorizes appropriations for the period from October 1, 1981, through March 1, 1984, to carry out Commission activities. Directs the Commission to conduct a study of the remaining barriers to adult postsecondary education, analyzing characteristics of current or potential adult postsecondary students (individuals 22 years of age or older) and the Federal response, as well as the ability of educational institutions to respond, to the needs of the growing postsecondary student population. Directs the Commission to include specified considerations in such analysis and to coordinate such study with research and demonstration priorities of the National Institute of Education and with other studies on student financial assistance authorized under such Act. Directs the Secretary of Education to make State allotments of funds for State planning and continuing education programs, according to specified formulas. Requires States to use portions of such funds for comprehensive statewide planning, information services, and continuing education. Includes among such continuing education programs those which promote or deliver postsecondary education services to women at the place of their employment or in conjunction with their employment. Authorizes the Secretary to make discretionary grants to and contracts with public and private entities from a specified portion of funds for such Education Outreach Programs. Directs the Secretary to appoint a National Advisory Council on Continuing Education to examine all federally supported continuing education and training programs, to make recommendations to eliminate duplication and effectuate coordination of such programs, and to report annually to the President and the Congress. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1985 to carry out State planning and continuing education programs. Requires that the non-Federal share cover at least one-third of the cost of such programs. Repeals specified Education Information programs of grants to States to pay the Federal share of the cost of planning, establishing, and operating Education Information Centers. =Title II: Amendment and Extension of the Higher Education Act of 1965= - Redesignates title II as \"College and Research Library Assistance and Library Training and Research.\" Extends through fiscal year 1985 the authorizations of appropriations for the existing programs of grants for college library resources, library training and research, and strengthening research library resources. Directs the Secretary (formerly the Commissioner of Education) to make resource development grants to institutions of higher learning and to other public and private nonprofit library institutions whose primary function is to provide library and information services to institutions of higher education on a formal, cooperative basis. Limits the amount of such grants to $10,000 each. Includes the establishment and maintenance of networks for sharing library resources with other higher education institutions among the permissible uses of such grant funds. Directs the Secretary to make grants to, and contracts with, institutions of higher education and library organizations or agencies to assist them in training persons in librarianship. Requires that at least 50 percent of such grants be for establishing and maintaining fellowships and traineeships. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, and contracts with, institutions of higher education and other public or private agencies, institutions, and organizations for research and demonstration projects related to library improvement, librarianship training, information technology, and dissemination of project information. Authorizes the Secretary to make special purpose grants to: (1) institutions of higher education to meet special national or regional needs in library or information sciences; (2) combinations of such institutions for joint-use library facilities, resources, or equipment; (3) other public and private nonprofit library institutions providing formal, cooperative library and information services to higher education institutions to improve such services; and (4) institutions of higher education for community service programs or projects. Requires recipients of such grants to expend specified matching sums. Directs the Secretary to make grants to institutions with major resource libraries. Bars recipients of such grants from receiving other specified grants in the same fiscal year. Establishes a new program to assess the feasibility and advisability of, and, if feasible and advisable, prepare a design for, a national periodical system to preserve and provide access to a comprehensive collection of periodical literature for public and private libraries throughout the United States. Establishes a nonprofit National Periodical System Corporation. Sets forth provisions for: (1) the functions of the Corporation (including guidelines for the design of such system); (2) a Board of Directors; (3) a Director and staff of the Corporation; (4) its nonprofit nature; (5) its authority; and (6) approval by Congress of such design before implementation. Specifies that such system shall have no effect on U.S. copyright law. Authorizes appropriations for such new program for fiscal years 1980 through 1985 and for additional sums to implement an approved design for any fiscal year through 1985. Exempts the National Periodical System Corporation from taxation by the United States, or any territory or possession thereof, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. Provides that property accepted by such Corporation under title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall be a gift, bequest, or devise to the United States for Federal tax purposes. =Title III: Establishment of a New Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965= - Establishes a new title III: \"Institutional Aid.\" Directs the Secretary of Education to carry out: (1) a \"strengthening institutions\" program to improve the academic quality, institutional management, and fiscal stability of eligible institutions; and (2) a program of short-term Federal assistance to strengthen the planning, management, and fiscal capabilities of institutions with special needs.

Limits the amount of such payments to 25 percent of the average of the loans guaranteed by a guarantor for three years preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made (or, if such guarantor does not have three years previous experience, 25 percent of the loans guaranteed under a program of a State of comparable size).
