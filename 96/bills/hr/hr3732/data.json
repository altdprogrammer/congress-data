    "text": "Veterans' Geriatric Health Services Act - States the purposes of this Act to be: (1) to provide for the increasing demand for geriatric and extended health care and medical services being placed on the Veterans' Administration (VA) hospital system; and (2) to make the VA hospital system foremost in the area of geriatric health care and the repository of gerontology medical knowledge. Establishes the Office of Assistant Chief Medical Director for Geriatrics and Extended Care within the Office of the Chief Medical Director of the VA. Stipulates that all VA geriatric services shall be coordinated through the Assistant Chief Medical Director for Geriatrics and Extended Care. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to designate 20 VA hospitals as demonstration centers of geriatric research, education, and clinical operations. Stipulates that such centers shall operate until September 30, 1983. Directs the Administrator to provide that: (1) each hospital operating as a geriatric center on the date of enactment of this Act be designated as the location for a demonstration center; (2) each designated hospital be affiliated with an accredited medical school having an organized geriatrics program; and (3) such designated hospitals be geographically dispersed across the United States. Directs the Administrator to establish a Geriatrics and Extended Care Task Force within the VA's Special Medical Advisory Group. Stipulates that such Task Force shall assess: (1) the VA's capability to provide geriatric services on a sustained and growing basis to eligible veterans; and (2) the current and projected needs for geriatric and extended health services among eligible veterans. Requires such Task Force to submit a report to the Administrator and the Special Medical Advisory Group within 18 months after the effective date of this Act. Directs the Administrator to transmit such report, (within 90 days of receipt) along with any comments, to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees. Requires a final report to be submitted by such Task Force within four years after the effective date of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of: (1) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1980; (2) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1981; (3) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1982; and (4) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1983."
