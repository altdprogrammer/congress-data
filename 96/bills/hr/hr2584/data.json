Retains the current requirement that a stepchild must be living with the employee or Member to qualify for survivor or health benefits. Redefines the medically underserved areas in which a carrier of a Federal health benefits plan must pay the costs of covered medical services provided by any practitioner licensed by the State to perform such a service. Terminates the annuity of a Federal annuitant who is elected as a Member of Congress, and entitles such Federal service by the Member to be credited toward retirement."
