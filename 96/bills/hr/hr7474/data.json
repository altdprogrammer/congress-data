Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress annually the most recent revision of the plan giving justification for any changes. States that any comments and recommendations of the Technical Panel (established under this Act) shall be included in the annual report to Congress. Directs the Secretary to initiate research or accelerate existing research in areas in which the lack of knowledge limits development of OTEC in order to achieve the purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to initiate a program to design, construct, and operate well instrumented OTEC facilities of sufficient size to demonstrate the technical feasibility of utilizing the various forms of OTEC to displace nonrenewable fuels. Provides for the competitive selection of at least two independent parallel pilot demonstration projects. Establishes goals for the demonstration program which shall include: (1) the demonstration of OTEC technical feasibility through multiple pilot demonstration plants with a combined capacity of at least 100 megawatts of electrical capacity or energy product equivalent by 1986; (2) the delivery of baseload electricity to utilities located on land or the production of commercially attractive quantities of energy product; and (3) the continuous operation of each pilot demonstration facility for a sufficient period of time to collect and analyze system performance and reliability data. Directs the Secretary to prepare a comprehensive technology application and market development plan that will permit the realization of the national goal set forth in this Act of 10,000 megawatts of electrical capacity or energy product equivalent from OTEC systems by 1999. Directs the Secretary to set priorities consistent with several criteria including: (1) the realization of competitive energy costs for OTEC; (2) private cost-sharing; (3) the promotion of OTEC in areas vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of fossil fuel; (4) preference for and priority to persons and domestic firms whose base of operations is in the United States; and (5) preference for projects in which the respondents certify their intent to become an integral part of the industrial infrastructure. Establishes the Technical Panel of the Energy Research Advisory Board to advise the Board on the conduct of the OTEC program and submit annual reports on the OTEC program to the Board. Directs the Board to submit such report, with any comments, to the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations for operating expenses for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Authorizes appropriations for the conceptual and preliminary design of demonstration plants with a combined capacity of at least 100 megawatts electrical or energy product equivalent."
