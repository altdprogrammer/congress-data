Directs the Secretary to increase the established price for the 1979 crop of corn, under similar conditions, to $2.30 per bushel, and to set the established price for the 1980 crop similarly as for the 1980 crop of wheat. Amends the Agriculture Act of 1949 to require the Secretary to proclaim a national program acreage for feed grains no later than October 15 (currently November 15) of each year for crops harvested in the next succeeding year."
