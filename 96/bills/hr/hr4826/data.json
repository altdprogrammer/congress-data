Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Labor, to conduct a study to determine whether such age restriction is warranted and whether the rules governing first- and second-class medical examinations for such individuals are adequate. Requires such report to be submitted to Congress within one year."
