    "date": "1979-07-24", 
    "text": "Educational Testing Act of 1979 - Declares the purpose of this Act to be to: (1) ensure that test subjects and persons using test results are aware of the uses and limitations of standardized tests in postsecondary education admissions; (2) make test-related information available to the public; (3) protect the public interest by promoting more knowledge about the use of standardized test results and by promoting greater accuracy in the administration and interpretation of such tests; and (4) encourage the use of multiple criteria in the grant or denial of any significant educational benefit. Requires each testing agency to provide to a test subject information concerning: (1) the purposes of the test; (2) the subject matters and the areas of skill or knowledge being tested; (3) interpretation and use of the results; (4) the form in which the scores will be reported; (5) any promises made by a testing agency with regard to accuracy, forwarding, and privacy of information of such scores; (6) the property interest of a test subject in such scores, and their storage, disposal, or future use; (7) the time period for mailing such scores to a test subject and designated recipients; (8) special services to accommodate handicapped test subjects; and (9) notice of the information rights and review procedure available to a test subject. Requires a testing agency to notify a test subject and designated recipients if the scores will be delayed ten days or more. Requires a testing agency to provide to the Commissioner of Education information concerning any study or statistical report pertaining to a test which it prepares or for which it provides data. Stipulates that such information shall be considered records for public information purposes. Directs the Commissioner to report to the Congress with regard to such information within one year of enactment of this Act. Requires a testing agency (with regard to any tests administered to 5,000 or more subjects nationally over a testing year) to file with the Commissioner: (1) a copy of all test questions used in determining such test's raw score; (2) the corresponding correct answers; and (3) all rules for transferring raw scores into the scores as reported to a test subject and designated recipients. Stipulates that such information shall be considered records for public information purposes. Requires a testing agency, upon request, to send to a test subject: (1) a copy of the test questions used to determine the raw score; (2) such test subject's answer sheet, along with the corresponding correct answers; and (3) a statement of the raw score if such request is made within 90 days of the release of the test score to the subject. Authorizes a fee to be charged to cover the costs of providing a test subject with such information. Prohibits test scores from being disclosed by a testing agency to any person, institution, or governmental agency unless specifically designated as a recipient by a test subject. Authorizes previous scores to be released to any currently designated recipient. Requires a testing agency to report specified cost-related information to the Commissioner to ensure that such tests are being offered at a reasonable cost. Requires additional cost-related information to be submitted if a separate fee is charged for admissions data assembly or score reporting services (as defined by this Act). Provides a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation of this Act by a test agency. Defines \"standardized test\" to mean a test affecting or distributed through interstate commerce (exclusive of one used by an individual institution for its own purposes or one used for non-admissions or credit-examination purposes): (1) used for postsecondary admissions; or (2) used for preliminary preparation for such postsecondary admissions tests."
