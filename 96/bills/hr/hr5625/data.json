    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes the President to present in the name of Congress an appropriate gold medal to the A. Philip Randolph Institute in recognition of A. Philip Randolph's lifelong advocacy of peaceful change on behalf of workers and minorities. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to cause to be struck a gold medal with suitable emblems, device, and inscriptions and authorizes the appropriation of $20,000 after October 1, 1981, for such purpose. Authorizes the Secretary to strike bronze duplicates of such medal for sale to the public. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from acquiring a nonbank depository institution except to prevent insolvency of the nonbank depository institution. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to submit to the Congress, by September 30, 1981, studies on the effects of such prohibition. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to require any Federal Home Loan Bank to price payments services consistent with the Federal Reserve Act as interpreted by the FHLBB and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to require the Central Liquidity Facility to make charges for payments services consistent with the Federal Reserve Act as interpreted by the National Credit Union Administration Board and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."
