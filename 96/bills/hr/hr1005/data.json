    "text": "Automobile Warranty and Repair Act - Amends the Magnuson-Moss-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act to apply to warranties for passenger motor vehicles the Federal minimum standards for warranties established by such Act. Declares that implied warranties for such vehicles may be limited to the duration of a written warranty of reasonable duration. Defines the term \"passenger motor vehicle\" as a motor vehicle with motive power, designed for carrying 12 persons or less. Declares that a court shall award a consumer who prevails in any action brought against a supplier, warrantor, or service contractor, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the cost to and expenses incurred by such consumer in the commencement of such action. Allows an action to be brought as a class action even though the number of named plaintiffs is less than 100. Entitles the consumer to retain possession and use of the passenger motor vehicle during the pendency of the action."
