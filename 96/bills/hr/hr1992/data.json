    "text": "Amends Part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act to prohibit: (1) the knowing and willful misrepresentation of a material fact in any application for aid under an approved State plan or for use in determining rights to such aid; (2) the concealment or failure to disclose information affecting rights to such aid with a fraudulent intent; or (3) the knowing and willful conversion of aid for the use or benefit of another person to some other use or benefit. Establishes a minimum criminal penalty for such violations of the value of the aid unlawfully secured and a maximum penalty of the greater of such value or $10,000 and/or one year imprisonment. Revises the fraud provisions of title XVI (Supplementary Security Income) and title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, and the Food Stamp Act of 1977, to establish as the minimum penalty the value of the benefit unlawfully received and as the maximum penalty the greater of such value or the fines currently provided. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish as a requirement for approval of State unemployment compensation laws that a State prohibit knowing and willful misrepresentation with respect to such compensation and establish as a minimum penalty the value of the compensation unlawfully secured."
