    "text": "National Ground water Environmental Research Act of 1980 - Title I: Ground Water Research and Planning - Directs the President to establish a Commission on Ground Water Research to develop guidelines and coordinate research by the States on identification of major freshwater aquifers in the United States and the extent of ground water pollution. Directs the Commission to make grants to States to conduct the freshwater aquifer research program. Requires the Commission to develop a comprehensive research plan for the prevention of ground water pollution. Authorizes the Commission to provide Federal, State, and local governments with technical advice on the protection of ground water from pollution. Directs the Commission to submit to Congress an annual report with recommendations for legislation on the protection of ground water from pollution. Title II: Institute for Research on Drinking Water Technology - Establishes an Institute for Research on Drinking Water Technology to conduct research and development on purification of drinking water. Stipulates that the Institute shall not conduct research on the health effects of drinking water. Sets forth the authorities of the Institute. Establishes an initial board of directors composed of Federal, State, and local officials and private water supply utilities officials appointed by the President. Authorizes the Institute to: (1) make research and development grants to institutions of higher education; (2) work with other agencies, institutions, and States in carrying out its functions under this title; and (3) assess and collect voluntary contributions from participating water supply agencies. Prohibits the Institute from engaging in lobbying activities. Sets forth the criteria for the operation of the Institute, including: (1) a location at or near a related laboratory or university; (2) establishment of a program for visiting researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and other scholars; and (3) the requirement that the bulk of the Institute's programs be conducted directly by the Institute and not be contract. Directs the Institute to: (1) develop new drinking water treatment and monitoring technologies; (2) improve existing drinking water treatment and monitoring technologies; (3) cooperate with research programs conducted under Title I of this Act and by participating water supply agencies; (4) publish archival and review articles; and (5) publish an annual progress report. Directs the Institute to establish a technology transfer program with water supply agencies. Requires the Institute to publish the results of a formal evaluation of such program."
