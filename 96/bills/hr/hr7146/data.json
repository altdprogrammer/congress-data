Requires the submission of an application and a determination by the Secretary that the lands applied for are suitable for such purpose and are not otherwise required by the United States and that the applicant has the ability and intention to construct and operate a shooting range. Permits the Secretary to terminate such lease if such lands are not being used as a shooting range or if the United States requires the leased land for national security reasons. Limits the use of such lands for the shooting of rifles, shotguns, pistols, bows, and similar instruments at targets, and for other activities necessarily incident to such uses. Prohibits the charging of an admission or use fee to the public."
