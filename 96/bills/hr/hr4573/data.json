Title II: Priority Projects - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to designate a maximum of six proposed energy facilities as priority energy projects during each calendar year. Allows any person planning or proposing an energy facility to apply to the Secretary for an order designating such facility as a priority energy project. Sets forth the procedure and criteria for designating priority energy projects. Excludes such determinations by the Secretary from the definition of major Federal action within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Directs the Secretary to encourage prospective applicants to file applications for any necessary Government actions or approvals with the appropriate agencies as soon as possible. Requires such Federal agencies to submit specified information to the Secretary not later than 30 days after public notice of an order designating a proposed energy facility as a priority energy project. Directs the Secretary to establish a decision deadline schedule. Provides for the extension of such deadlines. Delegates decision authority to the President if a deadline on the decision deadline schedule has elapsed without Federal agency decision or action. Provides for the Presidential extension of such deadlines. Directs the Secretary to grant certification of completed Federal agency review upon the determination that all Federal actions and approvals necessary to the completion of a priority energy project have been granted. Specifies that such certification shall indicate Federal approval expiration dates and shall constitute conclusive evidence in any judicial or executive proceeding that all necessary Federal permits have been granted. Directs the Secretary to notify the Governor of any State within which any portion of a priority energy project would be located and to request the Governor to submit specified information to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to submit all such information to the priority energy project and propose a decision schedule to assist State and local authorities in coordinating their activities with actions by the Federal Government. Title III: Judicial Review and Miscellaneous Provisions - Exempts from judicial review the actions of Federal officers or agencies pursuant to this Act, except as specified in this title. Exempts from judicial review a decision of the Secretary granting or denying an order designating a proposed energy facility as a priority energy project except as required by the Constitution of the United States. Sets forth judicial procedures for claims arising out of actions pursuant to this Act. Grants to the Supreme Court the exclusive authority to review an interlocutory judgment or order of the court of appeals pursuant to this title. Sets forth certiorari and certification procedures. Makes this Act effective 30 days after the date of its enactment. Provides for the expiration of the Secretary's authority to designate priority energy projects seven years after the date of the enactment of this Act."
