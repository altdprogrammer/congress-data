Authorizes appropriations for purposes of this Act through fiscal year 1985. Stipulates that 35 percent of such appropriated funds shall be used for comprehensive State planning programs. Provides that individual, eligible States shall receive such funds based on population, with a minimum grant of $50,000. Authorizes a State to request that a part of its allotment be transferred to another State for certain purposes. Requires States receiving less than $100,000 for such planning programs to use not less than 40 percent nor more than 50 percent of such funds for such purpose, and States receiving more than $100,000 to use not less than 30 percent nor more than 40 percent of such funds for such purpose. Authorizes States to use the remainder of such planning funds to implement statewide planning through grants to, or contracts with, appropriate State agencies and institutions. Stipulates that 30 percent of such Federal funds appropriated under this Act shall be used by eligible States for grants to institutions of higher education for post secondary continuing education and related adult education programs and services. Stipulates that 30 percent of such Federal funds appropriated under this Act shall be used for grants to, and contracts with, public and private agencies, institutions, and individuals for special purpose grants. Prohibits such grants from being given without the appropriate State agency having been given an opportunity to comment upon such grant's relevance to the State's comprehensive statewide planning program. Stipulates that five percent of such Federal funds appropriated under this Act shall be used for Federal lifelong learning activities, including the convening of a Lifelong Learning Conference in 1983. Requires States wishing to receive Federal funds for comprehensive planning programs and grants to institutions of higher education to submit an agreement. Sets forth guidelines for such agreement. Transfers responsibility for such programs from the Assistant Secretary to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Directs the President to appoint a National Advisory Council on Lifelong Learning within 90 days of enactment of this Act."
