Designates as wilderness and adds to the Florida Keys Wilderness certain lands referred to as North Cudjoe Key, located in Florida. Withdraws certain lands referred to as Raccoon Key from the Florida Keys Wilderness. Adds to and incorporates within the Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge and the Florida Keys Wilderness all lands on Raccoon Key. Prohibits the issuance of phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest, unless and until it is determined that the mining of phosphate deposits would be necessary to the national interest. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to certain individuals or companies which have applied for phosphate preference right leases and discovered valuable deposits, to exchange the preference right lease applications for leases covering other minerals subject to the Mineral Leasing Act without competitive bidding upon voluntary surrender. Specifies that such leases and the preference right lease applications to be exchanged shall be of equal value. Directs that if such leases and rights to leases are not of equal value, the values shall be equalized by the payment of money to the Secretary or the applicant so long as the payment does not exceed 25 percent of the value of the leases to be issued by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary, upon completion of each such negotiation for an exchange, to submit the details of such negotiation and exchange to specified Congressional Committees. Specifies that the designation of the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness shall not be construed to modify any rights in connection with any applications which are pending for Federal phosphate preference right leases applicable to any lands within such wilderness. Declares that if the Secretary is unable to effect an exchange governing any phosphate lease application covered by this Act he shall, within four years of the date of enactment of this Act, acquire the preference right to the leases by purchase or condemnation. Authorizes the Secretary to pay just compensation for rights to such leases."
