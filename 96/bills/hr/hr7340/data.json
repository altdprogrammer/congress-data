Requires the seller to make known to buyers the availability of such a discount. Repeals requirements that such a discount not exceed five percent. Repeals the authority of the Board to promulgate regulations characterizing cash discounts as finance charges under the Truth in Lending Act or State usury and credit disclosure laws. Defines \"regular price\" as: (1) the single posted price; or (2) the price paid using an open end credit plan or a credit card if no price is posted or two prices are posted."
