    "text": "Title I: - Adds a new title to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968. Defines \"generally applicable requirements\" as requirements which are placed on assistance recipients by Federal legislation or administrative rules and regulations, and which apply to two or more assistance programs. Directs the President to designate Federal agencies to establish standard rules and regulations for, and to report on the implementation of generally applicable requirements in the areas of: (1) labor practices; (2) public employee standards; (3) equal services requirements based on prohibitions of discrimination; (4) access to government information; (5) relocation and real property acquisition; (6) procurement standards; (7) planning; (8) finance and administration; (9) citizen participation; and (10) environmental protection when such requirements are part of a Federal assistance program. Directs Federal departments and agencies to comply with those rules within 120 days after such a rule is issued. Permits a designated agency to submit for review by the President and, subsequently, Congress a legislative proposal to exclude certain Federal assistance programs from all or part of its standard rules. Directs the President to designate the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to oversee the the administration of this title. Title II: Consolidation of Federal Assistance Programs - Directs the President to: (1) examine Federal assistance programs; and (2) prepare and transmit to Congress a plan for consolidating functionally related programs upon determining that such consolidation would improve the administration or efficiency of such programs. Requires that such a plan: (1) designate one agency to administer a consolidated program; (2) expire no later than six years after becoming effective; and (3) be transmitted to Congress before December 31, 1984. States that any such plan shall become effective upon approval by the President of a congressional resolution approving such plan. Sets forth House and Senate procedure for considering such a resolution. Requires the President to report to Congress annually on consolidation plans which are proposed and implemented under this title. Title III: Integrated Grant Development - Rewrites the Joint Funding Simplification Act of 1974 as the Integrated Grant Development Act of 1979. Requires Federal agencies to take specified measures previously authorized by the Joint Funding Simplification Act to provide for joint funding by and management of Federal assistance programs which have common interests. Directs the President to designate the OMB to take specified measures to carry out the provisions of this title. Title IV: Advance Appropriations - Amends the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 and the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 to provide for multi-year funding of Federal financial assistance programs. Title V: Miscellaneous - Requires Federal agencies, under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968, to provide the officials of a State or local government receiving Federal assistance with information concerning the amount and purpose of that assistance. Directs the OMB to develop the system of providing such information and to oversee agency compliance with this title. Authorizes Congress to include in Federal assistance legislation a provision which prohibits a State or local government from using Federal assistance to replace funding previously provided by that government. Authorizes the head of an agency to waive such a prohibition upon determining that it would cause extraordinary fiscal hardship."
