Requires carriers covered by this Act to engage the services of an independent neutral body to police compliance with obligations incurred or agreements made under this Act. Stipulates that any agreement made pursuant to this Act shall not prevent any carrier bound thereby from taking independent action on matters of rates and charges, required to be filed in tariffs, if certain administrative procedures are followed."
