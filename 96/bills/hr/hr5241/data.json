Education, and Welfare (HEW), in cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, the Director of the Community Services Administration, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to establish procedures for determining the needs of eligible low- income and elderly households for increased weatherization and other energy-related assistance and for providing such assistance on a time basis. Earmarks specified funds for the purpose of creating public information and outreach programs designed to ensure maximum participation in the energy assistance program established under this Act. Directs the Secretary of HEW, acting through the Social Security Administration, to establish a program to provide assistance to low-income and elderly households for meeting primary residential fuel costs. Sets forth criteria for determining the amount of such assistance, and requirements for eligibility. Specifies that the amount or value of benefits provided under such program shall not be considered income or resources for any purposes under any Federal or State law. Establishes a system of making payments to fuel suppliers supplying fuel to eligible recipients. Requires such suppliers to provide specified information to the appropriate State agency in order to qualify for such payments. Provides that such program shall be administered by the appropriate State agency according to an agreement between such agency and the Secretary, or, in the absence of such agreement, by the Secretary in accordance with regulations. Requires suppliers to keep full records and submit them to the Comptroller General as needed for auditing purposes. Prohibits suppliers from refusing to sell fuel to eligible participants solely on the basis of their participation in the fuel assistance programs established under this Act. Prohibits suppliers from terminating supplies of primary residential fuel to eligible households except in accordance with specified procedures. Imposes criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such fuel assistance program. Directs the Director of the Community Services Administration to establish a crisis intervention program to supplement the fuel assistance program with evacuation procedures, emergency shelter, home repair, or payment of bills. Authorizes appropriations for such crisis intervention for fiscal years 1980 through 1982. Title II: Middle-Income Energy Tax Credit - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit to eligible taxpayers for amounts paid for heating oil for principal residences."
