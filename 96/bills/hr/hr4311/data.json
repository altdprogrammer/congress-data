Authorizes the Secretary to commit personnel, funds, and other resources to establish, operate, and maintain facilities required for the protection of the preserve. Authorizes all Federal agencies to assist the Secretary in this endeavor. Prohibits the executive branch from taking any action contrary to the intent of this Act regarding the Antarctic Continent to a distance of 500 nautical miles from the mean annual projection of the Antarctic ice shelf.
