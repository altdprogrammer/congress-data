    "text": "Amends the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 to require that any request by the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment for any assessment activities by the Office have the approval of the Technology Assessment Boards. Requires members of the Board to be appointed or reappointed at the beginning of each Congress by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President pro tempore of the Senate. Allows the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to be a voting member of the Board. Prohibits any Member of Congress from serving on the Board during more than four full sessions of Congress beginning after 1980. Requires the Board to meet once every three months unless such meeting is dispensed with by the chairman, and at any time at the request of four or more Board members or upon the call of the chairman. Directs that no policy action or determination shall be taken, made, or promulgated, except by the Executive Committee, unless a majority of the Board assent. Requires the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to appoint the Director from among at least four candidates recommended by the Board without regard to political affiliation. Allows the Director, with the approval of the Board, to appoint a General Counsel to advise on legal and other matter. Establishes an Executive Committee consisting of the Director, two Senate members of the Board, and two House members of the Board. Prohibits any member of the Board (other than the Director) from serving on the Executive Committee for more than four consecutive years. Directs such Committee to perform routine duties and functions of the Board, including the approval or disapproval of specific assessment proposals and the preparation of an annual budget. Requires the Executive Committee to make annual reports to the Board summarizing its activities and making appropriate recommendations. Authorizes the Board to establish, from time to time, such advisory councils, on either an ad hoc or permanent basis, as it determines necessary to assure effective liaison with the public and to provide a source of scientific, technological, and other expertise not available within the Federal Government. Requires the duties and missions of any advisory council established by the Board to be advisory only. Requires the Executive Committee and the Librarian of Congress to agree upon the availability of services and assistance to the Office from the Congressional Research Service and also upon the amount of reimbursement, if any. Requires the Executive Committee and the Comptroller General to agree upon any financial and administrative services made available to the Office by the General Accounting Office."
