Sets forth the order of precedence as to the beneficiaries of such payment. Authorizes the Secretary to make an interim payment not to exceed $3,000 to a survivor who, in the Secretary's determination, probably will receive such a benefit. Declares that no such benefit shall be subject to execution or attachment. Prohibits payment of such benefit: (1) if death was caused by the intentional misconduct, suicide, or intoxication of the officer or fire fighter; and (2) to any beneficiary whose actions contributed the death of the officer or fire fighter. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the maximum fees which may be charged for services performed in connection with any claim for such a benefit. Declares that the provisions of this Act shall apply with respect to injuries sustained on or after September 23, 1976."
