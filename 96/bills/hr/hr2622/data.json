    "text": "Brown Lung Benefits Act - Entitles textile workers to claim benefits for death or total disability due to byssinosis (brown lung disease). Specifies the amounts of such payments, which are to be paid by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Provides that such benefits payments shall be reduced by the amount of payments received from certain other sources, such as workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, disability insurance, or a percentage of social security benefits. Requires any such claim to be also filed under the applicable State workers' compensation law. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to assure that the United States is equitably reimbursed by textile plant operators, on the basis of their yearly tonnage of cotton consumption, for the benefits paid under this Act. Stipulates that this Act does not relieve any employer of a textile plant of the duty to comply with any State workers' compensation law and that any such law which provides greater benefits shall not be construed to conflict with this Act."
