    "text": "Amends the Act of June 21, 1949, to allow the one year initial deferment period permitted by the Secretary of the Interior on annual assessment work on unpatented mining claims to be renewed annually for additional periods, not to exceed one year each, for so long as the Secretary finds such renewal is justified. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement of annual assessment work on unpatented mining claims for one or more assessment years if: (1) fulfillment of such requirement is impossible or would work a hardship on the claimant, and the deferment provisions are not applicable; or (2) deferment of annual assessment work has been granted under this Act for five consecutive years, and the Secretary believes that the legal impediment on which such deferment was based will continue for an extended period of time. Allows a waiver to be granted for past assessment years in which a deferment was permitted, as well as prospectively."
