Directs that adjustments in the rates of pay of Members of Congress shall take effect at the beginning of the Congress following the Congress in which they were approved. Conditions such adjustment on the approval of a concurrent resolution by a recorded vote by both Houses of Congress. Prohibits any congressional employee from being paid at a rate in excess of the rate payable for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives. Requires the President to transmit to the Congress, within the first 15 days of January after the date on which the report and recommendations concerning salaries of the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries are required to be submitted, his recommendations with respect to the rates of pay of Members of Congress, legislative, and judicial employees."
