    "text": "Hazardous Waste Containment Act of 1980 - States that nothing in this Act shall apply to oil, or other, pollution of navigable waters. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a plan which includes: (1) an investigation of inactive hazardous waste sites (any site or facility at which hazardous waste is, or has been, stored, treated, or disposed of); (2) an evaluation of any threat to public health and safety from such sites; (3) cleanup and containment priorities for such sites; (4) remedial measures for the release of hazardous waste from such sites; (5) the roles of the Federal, State, and local governments and other entities in implementing such plan; and (6) a program for the recovery from the liable parties of costs incurred in the cleanup and containment of such sites. Directs the Administrator to approve such plan, including any subsequent modifications, unless it fails to comply with this Act or it would not be cost-effective. Makes a State with an approved plan eligible for grants to implement such plan unless the Administrator determines that such State is not implementing such plan in good faith or has misapplied prior grants under this Act. Directs the Administrator to allocate such grants among eligible States on the basis of population and industrial production. Directs the Administrator to promulgate guidelines for making supplemental grants to eligible States. Requires that such grants be made only in emergency situations or to States which have a disproportionate number of inactive hazardous waste sites which pose substantial threats to public health or safety. Directs the Administrator to undertake a research program on hazardous waste management and provide training and technical assistance to States engaged in such management. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to State attorneys general to provide up to 50 percent of the costs of training and technical assistance for State employees engaged in recovering the costs of remedial actions taken by the State at inactive hazardous waste sites from the liable parties. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981-1985 to carry out this Act."
