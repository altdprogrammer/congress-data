Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to increase the level of crop production loans for the 1979 crop of any agricultural commodity to not less than 70 percent of parity, and for the 1980 crop to not less than 75 percent of parity. Sets forth a formula for the determination of loan levels for subsequent crop years of such crops. Raises the minimum price support of milk as of April 1, 1979 to 80 percent of parity."
