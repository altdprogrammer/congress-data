    "text": "Civil Rights Improvements Act of 1980 - Amends current law (42 U.S.C. 1983) creating a Federal cause of action for the violation of a person's civil rights under color of State law to specify the circumstances under which a State or local government may be held liable for purposes of damages or other monetary relief and for injunctive or declaratory relief. Stipulates that it is not a defense for a government entity that the officer or employee clothed with the authority of such entity is personally immune from liability under common law or any statute. Makes supervisory officers, with command responsibility superior to a person engaging in actionable conduct, jointly and severally liable whenever a government unit would be liable. Permits a plaintiff to join to a claim under such law other claims deriving from a common nucleus of operative fact. Makes a State or local prosecuting officer liable for failure to disclose to a defendant in a criminal proceeding, upon request, all material evidence reasonably known to be exculpatory. Sets forth the circumstances under which a Federal court may certify a question of State law to the highest court of a State. Prohibits the dismissal or stay of civil actions under this Act on the grounds that State legal and administrative remedies were not exhausted. Limits the circumstances in which a Federal court may stay a pending State criminal prosecution. Specifies the circumstances under which, in any such action, the prior judgment of a State court shall have merger and bar effect. Requires the complaint in any such action to be filed within four years after the right of action first accrues. Prohibits a Federal court, in evaluating the need for relief under such law, from considering the availability of other remedies under State law. Makes the right to enjoy one's reputation a right secured by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution."
