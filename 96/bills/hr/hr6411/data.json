    "text": "Amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to require that whoever uses or carries a firearm during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in Federal court shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such offense, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for the first offense, five years for the second offense, and ten years for the third or subsequent offense. Stipulates that such a sentence: (1) may not be suspended; (2) may not run concurrently; and (3) may not be reduced. Makes such an offender ineligible for release on parole, and makes the juvenile corrections and delinquency provisions inapplicable to such an offender."
