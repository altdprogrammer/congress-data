Limits the amount of such deduction to the lesser of 15 percent of the employee's compensation for the taxable year, or $1,000. Disallows such deduction for: (1) individuals claiming a deduction for contributions for retirement savings; (2) individuals who have attained age 70 1/2 in the taxable year of an employee contribution; and (3) government employees who are participants in a plan established by a Federal or State instrumentality. Excludes amounts contributed by an employee pursuant to the terms of this Act from the gross income of such employee."
