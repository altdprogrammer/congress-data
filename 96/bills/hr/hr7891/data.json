Prescribes maximum interest rates for savings and loan accounts of O.25 percent of the maximum rates for bank accounts. Terminates all authority to set maximum interest rates on June 30, 1987 (currently, March 31, 1986). Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Board Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to report to Congress regarding the ability of the housing industry to withstand the removal of the interest rate differential. Amends the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to require the respective Boards to limit interest rates or dividends on time and savings deposits to no more than the market rate of interest (the rate comparable to U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturity)."
