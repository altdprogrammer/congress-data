    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-706) Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979 - =Title I: Community and Neighborhood Development and Conservation= - Extends the rehabilitation loan program and authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 for community and neighborhood development and conservation provided under the Housing Act of 1964. Amends the Housing Act of 1954 to extend the comprehensive planning program and to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1980. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1980 for Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation programs under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. Reduces the authorization level for fiscal year 1980 for the neighborhood self-help development programs and the livable cities programs under the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. Increases the authorization for appropriations of the community development block grant program and the set aside under such program for nonentitlement metropolitan communities in fiscal year 1980. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to waive all or part of the summary, formulation, and description requirements of the community development block grant program under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 in those cases in which an application for a block grant does not involve a comprehensive community development program and such waiver is not inconsistent with the purposes of the program. Extends through fiscal year 1980 the provision that requires a pro-rata reduction in all block grants in the case of a shortfall in funding for entitlement. Makes any unit of local government which is part of, but not located entirely within, an urban county eligible for such block grants provided the funds received will be used in that part of the unit for which the grant was made and not in that part located outside of the urban county. Stipulates that such unit of local government may not be included as part of any other unit of local government for the purpose of computing such assistance. Makes general political subdivisions of the Northern Mariana Islands eligible for community development block grants. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate responsibility for certain environmental reviews to local governments. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants out of funds appropriated to the urban development action grant (UDAG) program to cities or urban counties experiencing severe distress in only certain areas within their boundaries and which do not meet the minimum standards for the UDAG program. Sets forth requirements based on population and prevailing income levels for determining eligibility for such grants. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria for selecting grant recipients from among the eligible areas. Prohibits the Secretary from using more than 20 percent of the funds available under the UDAG program for such grants. Predicates a project's eligibility under the UDAG program on the Secretary's determination that: (1) non-federal funds would not be invested in the project without the grant; and (2) the grant would not be a substitute for non-federal funds otherwise available to the project. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement that a town or township be closely settled in order to be eligible for community development grants. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse the Veterans Administration and the Secretary of Agriculture for properties transferred to urban homesteading programs approved by the Secretary. Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to reduce the authorization for neighborhood self-help development in fiscal year 1980. Allows up to ten percent of the assistance available under the Neighborhood Self-Help Development Act of 1978 to be used for uncertified projects demonstrating innovative means of assisting in neighborhood conservation and revitalization. Reduces the fiscal year 1980 authorization for the livable cities program. Requires local housing assistance plans to contain an assessment of the impact of the conversion of rental housing to condominium or cooperative ownership on the present and anticipated housing needs of lower income persons. Directs the Secretary to review such plans and submit a report to the Congress within six months. =Title II: Housing Assistance Programs= - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize appropriations for annual contributions to low-income housing projects and operating services through fiscal year 1980. Establishes a ceiling on the amount of appropriations the Secretary may use in entering contracts to assist public housing projects. Requires that specified amounts be made available for modernization of such projects.
