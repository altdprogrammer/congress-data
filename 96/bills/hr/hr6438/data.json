Increases the amount authorized to be appropriated to effectuate the establishment of such service. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire any real property which the Secretary deems necessary to effectuate such service. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with cost-sharing parties to permit the Secretary to incur obligations to carry out improvements in anticipation of reimbursement from such parties. Permits the Secretary to transfer to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation excess real or personal property from the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project. Establishes a goal of self-sufficiency for such intercity passenger service within five years of the completion of such Project. Amends the Department of Transportation Act to authorize the Secretary to establish a working capital fund for financing the activities of the Transportation Systems Center, including research and analysis."
