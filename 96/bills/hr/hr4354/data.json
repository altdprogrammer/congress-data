    "text": "Federal Firearms Act of 1979 - Amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to define \"handgun,\" \"pistol,\" \"revolver,\" and \"concealable handgun.\" Prohibits any person licensed under such Act from manufacturing, selling, delivering, or transferring: (1) any concealable handgun; or (2) any revolver or pistol which fails to meet specified requirements. Exempts from such prohibition the use of handguns for certain purposes, such as research or government use. Requires anyone carrying, using, or offering to use a firearm or destructive device during the commission of any felony prosecutable in Federal court to be imprisoned not less than ten years (and not less than 25 years for a second or subsequent offense), in addition to the punishment provided for such felony. Stipulates that such sentence shall not be suspended or run concurrently with any term or imprisonment imposed for such felony."
