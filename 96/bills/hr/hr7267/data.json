    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Declares certain lands to be held in trust for the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept certain lands, known as Government Hill, conveyed to the United States from the city of Siletz, and hold such lands in trust for the Tribe. Directs the Secretary to pay to the city of Siletz, Oregon, an appropriate amount for expenses incurred by the city in such conveyance. Declares that all such lands (including those to be conveyed to the Secretary) shall constitute the reservation of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon. Provides that the establishment of the Siletz Reservation does not grant or restore the tribe any hunting, fishing, or trapping rights beyond those rights set forth by the final judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon on May 2, 1980. Specifies that the State of Oregon has civil and criminal jurisdiction with respect to the Siletz Reservation in accordance with applicable provisions of law."
