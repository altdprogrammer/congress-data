    "text": "Postal Reorganization Act of 1979 - Title I: Organization of Postal Service - Reorganizes the structure of the United States Postal Service. Abolishes the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service. Places the authority of such Board in the Postmaster General. Makes the Postmaster General an officer appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. States that the Deputy Postmaster General shall be appointed by the Postmaster General. Title II: Procedures for Changing Postal Rates, Fees, and Services - Abolishes the Postal Rate Commission which sets postal rates and establishes classes of mail. Authorizes the Postal Service to make one change in postal rates and fees during any fiscal year, such change to be no greater than the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index during the preceding year. Provides that a rate increase greater than the increase in the Index may be implemented if not disapproved by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House or the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. Requires that any change in mail classification be approved by such committees. Requires the Postal Service to submit to Congress a detailed statement of any proposed change in postal services which would have a nationwide impact on the public, business, or postal employment. Declares that such proposed change shall become effective 60 days after submission unless either House of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving it. Sets forth House procedures for consideration of such resolution. Requires that the General Accounting Office transmit a report to each House of Congress reviewing the operation of amendments made by this Act. Title III: Miscellaneous - Authorizes the appropriation of such funds as are necessary to carry out the functions of the Postal Service for fiscal years 1980 and 1981. States that all revenues collected by the Postal Service shall be deposited in the general fund of the United States Treasury. Requires that the person appointed as postmaster of certain post offices: (1) must have resided within the city or town where such office is located for at least one year prior to appointment; and (2) must continue to reside in such area during service as postmaster. Directs the Postal Service to study the feasibility of hiring persons who have been unemployed for 60 days as a public service to combat unemployment. Title IV: General Provisions - States that the provisions of this Act do not affect any collective bargaining agreement or authority of the Postal Service."
