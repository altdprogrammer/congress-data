Authorizes the Secretary upon application by a qualified municipality to make guaranteed interest loans to such municipality to cover the costs establishing a district heating system. Requires that each loan application contain plans, specifications, and estimates for the proposed heating system. Sets forth the criteria for approval of loan applications by the Secretary. States that loan application approval by the Secretary shall be deemed a contractual obligation of the United States to grant the loan for the district heating system. Conditions Federal assistance for district heating systems on the disclosure of complete information on any such system to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States for studies by the States and local government entities on organization problems related to the establishment of district heating systems."
