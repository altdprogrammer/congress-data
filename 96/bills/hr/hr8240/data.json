    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-09-30", 
    "text": "Regulatory Negotiations Commissions Act of 1980 - States that it is the purpose of this Act to create a pilot program to encourage the formation of regulatory negotiation commissions, comprised of representatives of businesses, public interest organizations, labor, and State and local officials, for the purpose of making recommendations to Federal agencies on regulatory policy. Directs the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States to announce, by April 1, 1981, the availability of funds for the establishment of five commissions during each of fiscal years 1981 and 1982; and (2) to notify the public of the issues with respect to which applications for funding will be accepted. Restricts such issues to matters pertaining to regulatory policy in the areas of health, safety, and the environment for which: (1) major legislation has been enacted but proposed regulations have not been issued; (2) final regulations have been issued, but are likely to be revised; or (3) basic statutory changes are expected. Permits interested persons proposing to form a commission with respect to such an issue to apply for funding. Specifies the information to be included in an application including: (1) the need for the commission; (2) the name of and group represented by each proposed member; (3) the agenda of the commission; and (4) a statement that all members will negotiate in good faith and produce a final report on time. Authorizes the Chairman to approve an application only after determining that the commission: (1) will be able to make recommendations that will increase agreement among parties most affected by a particular area of regulation; (2) includes balanced and sufficient representation of such parties; (3) will be able to recommend alternatives which will provide significant improvements over existing policy; and (4) will provide an opportunity for all persons significantly affected by the area of regulation to participate. Directs any approved commission to attempt to reach an agreement on regulatory policy on the issues concerned. Authorizes such a commission to utilize the funds received to compensate a director and to pay the travel and per diem expenses of members and other administrative costs. Requires each approved commission to submit to the Chairman an annual report on its activities and final report setting forth the areas of agreement and disagreement on the issues addressed and any recommendations for regulatory policy. Directs the Chairman to transmit such final report to all agencies dealing with matters addressed in the report. Requires the agencies: (1) to comment on such report with a specified period; (2) to submit such comments to appropriate congressional committees; and (3) to consider the recommendations of the report when issuing regulations. Directs an agency, upon the commission's request, to send an observer to the commission meetings to provide information and make recommendations to the commission and to report on the meetings to the agency. Prohibits an observer from negotiating policy on behalf of the agency or from formally representing the agency. Requires the Chairman to report to Congress by January 1, 1983, on the formation, activities, and achievements of the approved commissions. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
