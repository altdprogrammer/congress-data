Sets forth the method of computing the annuity. Directs the Secretary of Labor to approve a claim for such an annuity if the claim meets the Secretary's regulations and includes evidence establishing that the claimant is a qualified participant or a qualified spouse. Sets forth the procedure for review of denial of such an annuity claim. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make annuity payments to entitled individuals after receipt of specified information from the Secretary of Labor. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to work with other Federal agencies to avoid unnecessary expense and duplication of functions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require disclosure of tax return information to Labor Department employees for comparison of specified records in order to establish the validity of an annuity claim."
