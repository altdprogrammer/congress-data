    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the rules for the deductibility of expenses for attendance at a foreign convention. Requires a taxpayer, in order to deduct expenses incurred in attending any convention held outside the United States, its territories or possessions, Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda, to establish that the meeting was directly related to his or her business or to an income-producing activity and that it was as reasonable for the meeting to be held outside the allowable North American areas as within them. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations for determining the reasonableness of attending a convention outside the allowable North American areas. Disallows any income tax deduction for the expenses of attending a convention on a cruise ship."
