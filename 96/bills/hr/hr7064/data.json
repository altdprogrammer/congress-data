    "text": "Western Arctic Area Management and Resource Development Act - Title I: Short Title, Policy, and Purposes - Declares that it is the policy of the United States that the development of the oil and gas resources within the Western Arctic Management Area is in the national interest and should be accomplished in an orderly manner while assuring the conservation of surface resources. Title II: Establishment and Planning of the Area - Establishes the area currently designated as the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska as the Western Arctic Management Area (area). Directs the Secretary of the Interior to administer the area through the Bureau of Land Management in accordance with provisions of this Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Secretary, within 16 months after enactment of this Act, to withdraw from entry and disposition under the public land laws any lands within the area which may be necessary for the management of the area. Revokes, after such 16-month period, any withdrawals or reservations made pursuant to the Naval Petroleum Reserves Product Act of 1976 with respect to such area. Directs the Secretary to prepare a long-range plan for the multiple use management of the area. Requires such plan to provide for: (1) an initial ten-year program for the efficient exploration for and development of gas and oil; (2) the protection of surface resources, especially within certain special management areas; and (3) the protection of opportunities for the continued subsistence use of the area. Directs the Secretary, in developing the plan, to provide for participation by the State of Alaska and affected local governments, Federal agencies, organizations, and individuals. Permits the long-range plan to be accomplished in stages. Requires an initial plan to be completed within 16 months after enactment of this Act. Declares that the first lease sale under the oil and gas leasing program included in the initial plan shall be conducted within 20 months after this Act is enacted. Directs the Secretary to review the long-range plan within five years after the initial plan is published and every ten years thereafter. Title III: Leasing Provisions - Directs the Secretary to grant, oil and gas leases within the area only to the highest qualified bidder by competitive bidding. Sets forth guidelines for conducting the bidding and for establishing lease tracts. Requires each lease issued by competitive bidding to be issued for an initial ten-year period and to remain in effect so long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities. Requires the holder of a lease to submit an exploration or development plan to the Secretary for approval before commencing exploration or development activities. Permits the Secretary to establish restrictions on leases to enhance safety, encourage efficient management, protect the environment, and conserve the area's natural resources. Permits lands offered for lease by competitive bidding but not leased to be made available for noncompetitive leasing in tracts of a specified size. Requires any lessee or individual permitted to conduct operations pursuant to this title to provide the Secretary access to any information obtained from such activity. Directs the Secretary to prescribe rules for the protection and release of any privileged information. Requires a lessee to cooperate with Federal officers responsible for monitoring and examining the lessee's activities under this title. Sets forth the enforcement procedure for, and the penalties for violations of, provisions of this Act, regulations issued pursuant to this Act, and the terms of any lease or permit issued under this title. Title IV: Disposal of Other Minerals - Designates the Western Brooks Range Mineral Zone within the area. Opens such zone to mineral entry pursuant to the Mining Law of 1872. Permits mineral entry into other lands within the area to the extent consistent with the exploration and development of petroleum resources and the protection of surface resources in the area. Title V: Other Administrative Provisions - Directs the Secretary to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out this Act. Permits any existing facilities used for subsistence purposes to remain and be maintained or replaced subject to any restrictions the Secretary may impose. Authorizes the Secretary to permit the construction of new facilities for purposes of subsistence, public health, and area use and management. Requires the United States to pay specified amounts of the revenue generated by this Act to: (1) the Alaska Native Fund; (2) the Department of the Treasury; and (3) the State of Alaska for public service purposes. Requires the Secretary to establish a Western Arctic National Conservation Area Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary concerning the long-range plan for the multiple use management of the area and the promulgation of regulations to implement this Act."
