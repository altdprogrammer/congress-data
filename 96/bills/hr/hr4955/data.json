Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish disaster relief to alleviate the famine in Cambodia through international agencies and private voluntary organizations to the extent feasible. Stipulates that such assistance shall be for humanitarian purposes and limited to the civilian population. Requires the President to ensure that such assistance reaches the famine victims and to report to Congress concerning the distribution. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Permits obligations already incurred to be charged against such authorized appropriations. Permits the President to transfer up to $30,000,000 of the funds available for other foreign assistance programs (without regard to specified limitations) to provide such assistance to Cambodia. Stipulates that priority be given to furnishing agricultural commodities in allocating assistance under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Amends the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act to continue the 75 percent Federal contribution to State and local agencies for assistance to Indochina refugees. Directs the President to report to Congress on the estimated total costs to the Federal, State, and local governments for refugee assistance."
