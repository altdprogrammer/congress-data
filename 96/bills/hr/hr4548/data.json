    "text": "Solid Waste Hazard Removal Act of 1979 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the payment of a fee by a generator of any hazardous waste identified or listed under such Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue regulations identifying toxicity levels of each hazardous waste identified or listed under such Act and establishing fee scales payable by generators of such wastes. Terminates the fee payment provisions of this Act six years after the effective date of such regulations. Directs the Administrator to issue regulations requiring former and present owners and operators of specified hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities to file with the Administrator notification of the facility location, a description of the activity at such facility, and the identity and amount of each hazardous waste handled at such facility. Imposes criminal penalties for failure to file such notification. Authorizes the Administrator to inspect any facility for which notification is required and examine the facility's records to determine the existence of any hazardous waste presenting a substantial endangerment to life. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Hazardous Waste Response Board a report of such determination and directs such Board to prepare and submit to the Administrator for implementation a plan for the removal of the endangerment to life presented by such waste. Establishes the Hazardous Waste Response Board in the executive branch. Authorizes the Administrator to detail EPA personnel to assist such Board upon request. Sets forth the functions of such Board, and authorizes the Board to issue subpenas for the purposes of conducting and hearings held by the Board. Establishes in the United States Treasury a revolving fund into which fees collected pursuant to this Act shall be paid and authorizes the Administrator to use such fees to implement hazardous waste removal plans submitted by the Board. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for implementing such plans. Prohibits States having hazardous waste programs from carrying out programs in lieu of the Federal program authorized by this Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Prohibits citizen suits from being brought for violation of, or failure by the Administrator or the Board to perform any act or duty under, this Act."
