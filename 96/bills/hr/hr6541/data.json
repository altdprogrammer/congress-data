    "text": "Household Goods Shipper Protection Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act directing the Interstate Commerce Commission, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, to issue regulations prohibiting a household goods carrier from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the advertisement, offer, or provision of transportation of household goods. Authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission to issue cease and desist orders against any person engaging in such practices. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Permits household good carriers and shippers to establish dispute settlement procedures by submitting an application for establishing such procedures to the Commission for approval. Permits the Commission to investigate the functioning of any such procedures and to revoke or suspend its approval for failure to meet the specified requirements. Sets forth the requirements for such procedures, including notifying the shipper before a contract becomes binding, no charges to the shipper for using such procedures, and the availability of independent parties to hear and resolve disputes. Sets forth the responsibilities of the dispute settler, including the notification of all parties to the dispute of any and all decisions reached, and their obligations under the decision. States that such decision shall not be legally binding on any party to the dispute. Makes the results of such decision admissible in a court proceeding at the discretion of the shipper. Sets forth the conditions under which a shipper may be awarded attorney's fees."
