Authorizes (currently requires) the Secretary of Energy to terminate and recover the remaining financial assistance for State, school, and hospital energy conservation projects which are not in compliance with the State plan. Authorizes the Secretary to allocate less than the current mandatory percentage of State technical assistance funds to schools or hospitals. Authorizes appropriations for energy conservation project grants to schools and hospitals for fiscal years 1982- 1984. Revises the method by which such appropriations are allocated among the States. Amends the Energy Conservation and Policy Act to replace the technical assistance program with the energy conservation project designed to assist energy conservation in buildings owned by units of local government and public care institutions. Directs the Secretary to prescribe criteria for determining hardship classification project grants to pay up to 90 percent of the costs of a hardship energy conservation project. Authorizes the use of energy conservation project grants to pay up to 90 percent of the costs of a hardship energy conservation project. Authorizes appropriations for grants to States for energy audits and energy conservation projects for fiscal years 1982-1984. Revises the method of allocating such grants among the States."
