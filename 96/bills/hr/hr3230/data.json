    "text": "Senior Citizen Higher Education Opportunity Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require that higher education institutions of 5,000 or more full-time students receiving Federal aid submit to the Commissioner of Education a senior citizen access plan providing for tuition-free registration of qualified senior citizens in scheduled classes and programs on a space available basis. Directs that such plan be implemented to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. Defines \"qualified senior citizen\" as an individual 60 years of age or older who has completed all course requirements mandated by the institution of higher learning for enrollment in the scheduled class or program. Deems that a class or program has space available if it is not fully subscribed by students other than nonpaying senior citizens. Enjoins the payment of funds or the approval of supplemental or special grants under specified titles of such Act unless the institution seeking aid has established and fully implemented a senior citizen plan."
