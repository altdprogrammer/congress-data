Encourages all Federal departments and agencies to utilize their statutory and administrative authorities in furtherance of the policy of this Act. States that such plans shall: (1) vest overall plan development responsibility in a designated State agency; (2) provide for an inventory of the nongame fish and wildlife, and other appropriate fish and wildlife of value to the public; (3) specify certain identifying and geographical factors relating to such species; (4) identify problems which may adversely affect the plan species and their habitats; (5) determine intended State actions to conserve the plan species and habitats; (6) establish priorities for implementing such actions; (7) provide for monitoring the plan species and the effectiveness of such actions; (8) provide for plan review and revision; (9) ensure public participation in plan development and revision; and (10) provide that the designated State agency consult and coordinate actions with appropriate Federal, State, local, and regional agencies in developing such plans to avoid duplication of effort. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to approve any such plans or actions which are substantial in character and design unless implementation would threaten the natural stability or continued viability of any plan species concerned. Permits the Secretary to deem certain conservation actions to be reimbursable nongame fish and wildlife projects in the absense of an approved plan under certain conditions. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to reimburse eligible States for costs incurred in connection with development and revision of conservation plans and actions, subject to specified limitations. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations setting forth the terms and conditions of such reimbursement. Sets forth a formula for allocation of funds for administration and reimbursement of States. Authorizes Federal agencies to assist any State in developing or revising such plans. States that nothing in this Act shall affect: (1) State regulation of fish and wildlife; (2) the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to control predatory or wild animals; and (3) State requirements that acquisitions be from willing sellers. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of making reimbursements to States and for administering this Act. Directs the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to study the most equitable and effective mechanism for funding projects under this Act and submit the results and recommendations to the appropriate congressional committees."
