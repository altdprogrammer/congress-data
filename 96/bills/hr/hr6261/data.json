Requires the Director to report annually to the President and to the Congress on the activities carried out under this Act. Confers upon the Director the primary responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of Federal and State youth camp safety regulations. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and modification of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Director for his approval. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in the United States court of appeals. Authorizes the Director to make grants to States for the development of youth camp safety plans, such grants not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of carrying out the State plan. Authorizes the Director to enter and inspect youth camps and their records. Prescribes penalties for violations by youth camp operators of the standards promulgated pursuant to this Act. Establishes judicial procedures to restrain any condition or practice which poses an imminent danger of serious injury at such camps. Charges the Director with establishing within the Department of Health and Human Services a Federal Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety."
