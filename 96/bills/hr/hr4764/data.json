Prohibits the VA from making such disclosure until 30 days have elapsed after reasonable efforts have been made to notify the individual of the VA's intention to disclose debt information. Prohibits disclosure of such information by the VA in a case of a disputed claim until the accuracy of the information is determined or until the Administrator reviews such claim. Provides that records disclosed to a consumer reporting agency may be used only for the purpose provided for by this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to make such disclosures for use in connection with civil debt collection proceedings."
