    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-01-15", 
    "text": "Correctional Services Improvement Act - Title I: Correctional Centers and Services - Authorizes the Attorney General to plan, construct, operate, and transfer the following types of correctional centers in accordance with this Act; (1) demonstration correctional centers for the commitment or treatment of accused persons awaiting trial, persons sentenced to terms of one year or less, and persons on probation or parole; (2) regional youth correctional centers for the commitment and treatment of youths and young adults sentenced pursuant to the Federal Youth Corrections Act; and (3) demonstration correctional centers for special offender groups of persons sentenced to terms in excess of one year or committed for an indeterminate period, including such offender groups as the mentally ill or defective, the violent and dangerous, and women. Authorizes the Attorney General to contract with appropriate State and local authorities of the region in which a center is constructed to make available center facilities, services, and programs. Empowers the Attorney General to transfer, subject to specified conditions, a center to the State in which it is located upon making certain findings. Authorizes the Attorney General to prescribe minimum standards relative to the construction, operation, and programs of jails, other correctional facilities, and correctional services owned or operated by a State or political subdivision thereof and in which persons accused or convicted of Federal crimes may be confined or treated. Title II: Coordination of Federal Correctional Activities - Replaces the Advisory Corrections Council with a Federal Corrections Coordinating Council. Directs the Council, in addition to performing the duties of the Advisory Corrections Council, to issue guidelines for the operation of the Board of Parole, the Youth Division of the Board of Parole, and the Division of Probation of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and to establish a program of continuing research and experimentation to develop more effective techniques for the treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders. Empowers a Federal court to require as a condition of probation or parole that a person reside in and/or participate in the program of a residential community treatment center. Title III: Federal Corrections Institute - Establishes a Federal Corrections Institute to provide training for representatives of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers, judges and judicial personnel, probation and parole personnel, correctional personnel, and other persons connected with the treatment and rehabilitation of criminal offenders. Creates an Advisory Commission to supervise the policy and operation of the Institute. Directs each candidate for admission to the Institute to apply to a specified State agency, which, in turn, is directed to select an appropriate number of candidates and forward their applications to the Institute for final selection. Title IV: Eligibility for Parole; Youth Correction Act Amendments - Repeals the requirement that a Federal prisoner serve one-third of the sentence imposed or 15 years, whichever is less, in order to be eligible for parole unless the court imposing the sentence specifies otherwise. Retains the power of the court to designate a minimum term of up to one-third of the sentence which must be served before the prisoners may be released on parole. Amends the Federal Youth Corrections Act to direct the release of youth offenders sentenced pursuant to specified provisions: (1) conditionally at the expiration of two-thirds of the maximum term authorized by law for the offense of which the offender stands to be convicted, and (2) unconditionally before the expiration of such maximum term if the offender has not before that time been released in accordance with other specified time limits. Permits the Youth Correction Division of the Board of Parole to discharge a committed youth offender unconditionally at any time after conditional release. Stipulates that the authority of the Attorney General to determine the place and conditions of confinement of Federal prisoners shall extend to all juveniles. Requires that committed youth offenders and juvenile delinquents be given credit toward release for any time spent in custody in connection with the acts or offenses for which commitment was ordered. Title V: Commitment of Dangerous Persons Found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity - Directs that not guilty verdicts, in prosecutions in which the defendant raises the defense of insanity, specify whether the defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the offense or whether the defendant was found not guilty for other reasons. Requires that the court in which the criminal proceedings were conducted determine by hearing the dangerousness of a defendant found not guilty due to insanity whenever the court or the United States attorney believes that such person, if unconditionally released, would constitute a danger to himself or others. Sets forth guidelines relative to such hearings Directs the court, upon a finding of dangerousness, to either order that the defendant be released under its supervision and subject to such conditions as it may imposed or commit such person to the custody of the Surgeon General for commitment to a suitable mental institution. Specifies procedures through which such conditions of release may be modified and such commitment terminated."
