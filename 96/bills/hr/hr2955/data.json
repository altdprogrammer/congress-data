    "text": "National Home Health Care Act of 1979 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove the 100-visit limitation presently applicable to the home health service program. Extends the coverage of posthospital home health services to include payment for items and services which the individual could otherwise obtain in a skilled nursing facility. Requires the inclusion of home health services in a State's Medicaid program under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act and permits the payment of rent under such program for elderly persons who would otherwise require nursing home care. Establishes, in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a Home Health Patient Ombudsman, appointed by the Secretary, with the duties of monitoring specified programs under the Social Security and the various medical assistance programs under the State plans approved pursuant to such Act, and maintaining such oversight of those programs and their operation and administration as may be necessary to: (1) assure that home health patients are receiving the care to which they are entitled; (2) provide safeguards against over-charging for home health services; (3) identify abuses against home health patients; (4) receive and expedite complaints by home health patients; (5) recommend to the Secretary any changes in the regulations affecting home health services which may appear necessary or desirable; and (6) take appropriate action (including the transmission of findings to the Attorney General) with respect to abuses and violations of law affecting the provision or receipt of home health services under such programs. Amends the Medicaid program to make children over 18 of parents receiving nursing and home health care assistance under such program liable for a specified portion of the expenses of such assistance, depending upon the income of such child. Permits the waiver of such obligation in any case where the State agency determines, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the imposition of such obligation or the making of such collection would impose undue hardship. Establishes a revolving fund in the Treasury to collect such funds and to distribute such funds. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide that any amount collected from or otherwise paid by any person in satisfaction of any obligation imposed shall constitute a medical expense paid or incurred by such person for purposes of deductions under such Act. Provides expanded Federal funding for congregate housing for the displaced and the elderly by increasing the amount available for such housing under the low income housing program."
