Rept. 96-878 (Part I)) Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish programs of land diversion payments with respect to the 1980 crops of feed grains and wheat to divert from production 12 million metric tons of feed grains and 4 million metric tons of wheat. Requires producers seeking such payments to devote not less than 15 percent of feed grain cropland and not less than 10 percent of wheat cropland during the 1980 crop year to approved conservation purposes. Sets forth the formulae for computing the payment to a producer under such programs. Sets a payment rate for corn, for the purposes of such formulae at not less than $1.25 per bushel with all other feedgrain prices fixed in relation to such price, and at $1.50 per bushel of wheat. Requires the Secretary to make an advance payment available to such producers equal to not less than 75 percent of the estimated payment to be received. Directs the Secretary to implement and administer a special wheat acreage grazing and hay program for the 1980 crop year."
