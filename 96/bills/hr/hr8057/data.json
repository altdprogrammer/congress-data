Directs the Secretary, if such relationship exists, to: (1) notify the manufacturer and the registered owner of such aircraft of such determination; and (2) order the manufacturer to remedy such condition. Directs a manufacturer to notify the registered owner and the Secretary if such manufacturer knows that: (1) an unsafe condition exists in an aircraft; and (2) such condition is related to a design or manufacturing defect. States that the cost of repairs (except labor) mandated by this Act shall not be charged to the registered owner of the aircraft involved. Provides for reimbursement of an aircraft owner by the manufacturer if such owner performs required repairs within a specified period. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to compromise such penalties subject to specified considerations."
