    "as": "Conference report filed in Senate", 
    "date": "1979-07-27", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in Senate, S. Rept. 96-261) Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to increase the authorized appropriations for the food stamp program for fiscal year 1979 from $6,158,900,000 to $6,778,900,000. Eliminates the provisions of such Act which provide for the carryover of unexpended funds appropriated under such Act from one fiscal year to the next, beginning in fiscal year 1980. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit monthly reports to the appropriate committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the second preceding month's expenditures under the program and cumulative totals for the current fiscal year, as well as the Secretary's statement as to whether there is reason to believe that reductions in the value of allotments issued to households certified to participate in the food stamp program will be necessary. Removes the requirement that the only available method for reducing program benefits when insufficient funds are available is on a pro rata basis. Directs the Secretary to ensure that reductions reflect, to the maximum extent practicable, the ratio of household program income to income standards of eligibility for households of the same size, with higher income households to receive the greater reductions. Authorizes the Secretary to establish: (1) provisions for the elderly, handicapped, and disabled in such reduction; and (2) minimum allotments after any reductions are otherwise determined. Directs the Secretary, within 60 days of the issuance of a statement concerning the necessity of such reductions, to take the requisite action to reduce allotments. Requires the Secretary to furnish the appropriate committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate a statement setting forth: (1) the basis of the Secretary's determination; (2) the manner in which the allotments will be reduced; and (3) the action that has been taken by the Secretary to reduce the allotments, within seven days of any such action. Grants households that contain an elderly person (60 years or older), a person receiving supplemental security income (SSI) benefits under the Social Security Act; or a person receiving Social Security disability payments: (1) an excess medical expense deduction for costs that exceed $35 monthly; (2) a dependent care deduction, when such care enables a household member to accept or continue employment or training or education that is preparatory for employment; and (3) an excess shelter expense deduction to the extent that the monthly amount expended for shelter exceeds 50 percent of the household income after all other applicable deductions have been allowed. Defines allowable medical expenses for purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary and State agencies to require social security numbers of food stamp program applicants and participants. Requires disqualified individuals to agree to either a reduction in their allotment or a repayment in cash to the Federal Government for fraudulently obtained food stamps before such individuals may be eligible to again participate in the food stamp program. Permits States to retain half of the funds they collect from persons who have committed such fraud. Makes blind and disabled residents in a certified public or private nonprofit group living arrangement eligible for food stamps. Makes households with individuals involved in a labor-management dispute ineligible for food stamps unless such household meets specified requirements. Makes this Act effective on the date of enactment, except that the medical and shelter expense deduction provisions shall be effective on January 1, 1980. Requires States to implement the provisions concerning blind and disabled residents of group homes by July 1, 1980. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations implementing the provisions concerning social security numbers, repayment, and State share of recoveries within 150 days of enactment of this Act."
