    "text": "Integrated Environmental Assistance Act of 1979 - States that the objective of this Act is to provide a mechanism to encourage recipients of assistance under programs administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to design integrated environmental programs tailored to their specific needs which will result in a more effective and efficient method of dealing with interrelated environmental problems. Authorizes the Administrator of EPA to award assistance to support proposals intended to meet such objective. Sets forth requirements for approval of such integrated environmental programs, including the requirement that an integrated environmental plan address the objectives of at least two programs covered by EPA categorical grants. Provides that in the event an integrated environmental plan is not acceptable, the applicant is still permitted to apply for categorical assistance for the particular program. Requires the Governor of a State and the chief executive officer of a local government to sign integrated assistance applications to assure high level support and involvement in program integration. Authorizes the Administrator to award integrated assistance in lieu of categorical assistance. Limits the use of such integrated assistance funds. Limits the number of States and local governments which may participate in such program. Authorizes EPA to directly award integrated assistance to local governments and interstate agencies when the State either does not apply for integrated assistance or does not make adequate provision for the local government or interstate agency. Directs the States to consult with local governments during the process of developing such program plans. Authorizes the Administrator to permit applicants flexibility in proposing to transfer funds among the covered programs in their approved plans, with specified limitations. Allows each applicant for integrated assistance to compete with others for supplementary assistance for nonrecurring projects which are innovative, of special national significance, or which address other special environmental needs. Sets forth administrative provisions relating to unobligated sums and maintenance of effort. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for supplementary assistance for fiscal year 1980 and authorizes appropriations of necessary sums for each of fiscal years 1981-1984, in addition to funds authorized to be appropriated under the covered programs. Authorizes the Administrator to detail EPA personnel to a recipient to assist in carrying out approved integrated program plan. Terminates this Act on September 30, 1984. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on such integrated assistance programs, including an evaluation of such programs and recommendations concerning their continuation."
