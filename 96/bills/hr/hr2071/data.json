Authorizes the Council to provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local agencies to assist them in implementing principles, standards, and procedures established by the Council. Limits the technical review by the Council. Provides for congressional review of the Council implementation of specified provisions. Makes the Council Chairman responsible for the appointment of a staff director. Establishes a State Water Advisory Council to provide for broad national representation in the area of water management, which will meet periodically with the Water Resources Council. Provides for the appointment and supervision of the river basin commission chairmen by the Council Chairman (instead of the President). Establishes a Federal program to assist States in water management activities and the development and use of water and related land resources. Conditions such assistance on the State designating an agency to develop a State water management program which meets specified standards.
