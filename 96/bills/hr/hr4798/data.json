Requires that such stoves be used to heat a building currently heated by oil in a State where a shortage of heating oil has been declared by the Governor. Prohibits the term of any such loan from exceeding five years. Sets the interest rate on such loans at the prevailing rate for small business disaster loans. Prohibits an individual whose income exceeds 120 percent of the State median income from receiving such a loan."
