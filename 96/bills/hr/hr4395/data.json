Rept. 96-590) Public Disclosure of Lobbying Act of 1979 - Declares that this Act does not apply to: (1) practices or activities regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971; or (2) specified tax-exempt organizations. Requires each organization which expends more than $5,000 per quarter year for lobbying purposes to register with the Clerk of the House of Representatives (Clerk) and to update annually such registration. Requires the identification of certain persons retained for such lobbying purposes. Requires such organization to file quarterly reports concerning such lobbying activities including: (1) listing of total lobbying expenditures including each expenditure over $35 made to or for the benefit of any Federal officer, congressional employee, or member of Congress; (2) the identification of retainees of an organization or certain employees making lobbying communications and the expenditures made pursuant to retaining or employing such persons; (3) a description of the issues for which such an organization has lobbied; (4) the identification of the employee, retainee, or chief executive officer of the organization who made lobbying communications on each issue; and (5) known business contacts with the person whom such organization is attempting to influence. Specifies duties of the Clerk concerning the management of such disclosed information which include making copies of each registration and report required by this Act available for public inspection and copying. Makes any person who knowingly violates the registration, recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this Act subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100,000. Directs the Attorney General: (1) to notify an individual or organization upon initiating an investigation concerning a suspected violation of this Act by such person; and (2) upon determining that such violation did occur, to attempt to correct such violation through informal methods. Authorizes the Attorney General to institute a civil action to compel compliance with provisions of this Act if such informal methods fail. Authorizes the Attorney General to issue a civil investigative demand requiring a person suspected of violating this Act to produce specific documentary material. Sets forth the procedure governing the service of such a demand and the custody of the documentary material. Permits the Attorney General to petition the court for an order to enforce such demand and permits the person served with such demand to petition for a court order to modify the demand. Directs the Clerk to transmit reports to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate no later than March 31 of each year concerning activities of the Clerk under this Act. Provides a Congressional veto of rules and regulations promulgated by the Clerk pursuant to this Act. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act and specified provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Authorizes to be appropriated $1,600,000 for each of the fiscal years 1981-1983."
