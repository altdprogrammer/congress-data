    "text": "Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to exempt manufacturers of fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in any model year from: (1) the average fuel economy standards for such year; and (2) the information and reporting requirements for such year. Exempts from such standards manufacturers whose domestically manufactured production commenced after a specified date. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to include certain foreign-manufactured automobiles in such manufacturer's calculation of average fuel economy when: (1) at least 50 percent of the cost to the manufacturer of such automobiles is attributable to value added in the United States or Canada; (2) such automobiles have never previously been domestically manufactured; (3) such automobiles are manufactured before a specified model year; and (4) any automobile assembled in Canada is imported into the United States within 30 days after the end of the applicable model year. Prohibits such manufacturer from including such automobiles for more than four model years. Permits a manufacturer to apply for such inclusion under specified conditions. Directs such manufacturer applying for inclusion to submit a manufacturing plan with specified information. Sets forth provisions to be followed by the Administrator in approving or disapproving of such manufacturing plans. Allows an aggrieved party to petition the appropriate court for review of the Administrator's actions under this Act. States that the failure of any manufacturer to comply with any average fuel economy standard shall not be deemed unlawful conduct if the manufacturer has sufficient credits or time in which to gain such credits to offset any penalty which would otherwise be assessed. Permits credits earned for exceeding the required fuel economy levels for any given model year to be used to offset any penalties such manufacturer may have incurred for the three consecutive model years prior to such year or any penalties such manufacturer may incur in the succeeding three consecutive model years. Extends the time available to all passenger automobile manufacturers in which to carry forward or carry back such credits."
