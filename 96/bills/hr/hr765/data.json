    "text": "Comprehensive Social Security Reform Act of 1979 - Amends title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to remove the ceiling on the amount of earnings which may be counted for social security benefit and tax purposes. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that taxes payable for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance shall not be imposed with respect to wages received by or paid to an individual during any calendar year to the extent that such wages do not exceed $4,000. Increases the primary insurance amount under title II. Decreases to 55 the age at which an individual may become entitled to full benefits under title II, if such individual is a member of an identifiable group within the general population whose members have actuarially determined life expectancies which are significantly lower than the average actuarially determined life expectancy of all residents of the United States. Repeals the earnings test under title II. Requires that Federal employees be covered by title II. Decreases from 20 to 5 the number of years a divorced woman must have been married to an insured individual in order for her to qualify for wife's or widow's benefits on his wage record. Authorizes appropriations to specified trust funds from which amounts are paid under title II and title XVIII (Medicare) under this Act in order to place such funds in the same position at the end of a fiscal year as the position in which they would have been if this Act had not been enacted."
