Prohibits the Commission from spending more than $500,000 for any of the above purposes until the Commission has given 30 days notice to the House Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs and Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works or until such of those committees has approved such expenditure. Directs the Commission to continue and complete proceedings initiated before the enactment of this Act concerning the issuance of an operating license notwithstanding any antitrust review that is being made with respect to the issuance of a license. Directs the Commission to condition the issuance of an operating license so that the antitrust review findings may be given full force and effect. Requires the Commission to resume and complete proceedings on the Generic Environmental Statement on Mixed Oxide Fuel (GESMO). Directs the Commissioner to conduct a study in order to submit to Congress recommendations for developing statistically valid data on the long term health effects of employment in the nuclear power industry. Directs the Commission to use such sums as may be necessary to establish a Three Mile Island Advisory Panel to consult with and make recommendations to the Commission on matters relating to the decontamination of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. Directs that the Commission shall consult with the Panel concerning all decontamination activities authorized by the Commission."
