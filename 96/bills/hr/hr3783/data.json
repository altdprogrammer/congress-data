    "text": "Title I: Export Administration - Export Administration Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to repeal provisions concerning the control and monitoring of exports and the information to be provided exporters. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue validated, qualified general, general, or other export licenses depending on the circumstances. Requires the Secretary to maintain a commodity control list of goods or technology subject to export control. Authorizes the President, through the Secretary, to restrict the exports of goods or technology which would be detrimental to U.S. military security, by means of export licenses. Requires the Secretary to publicize the imposition of such controls. Stipulates that U.S. policy concerning export controls and individual countries shall not be based exclusively on the country's Communist or non-Communist status, but shall take into account various factors. Directs the Secretary to maintain, as part of the commodity control list, a list of goods or technology subject to export controls. Directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a list of military critical technologies, emphasizing goods currently not possessed by countries subject to export controls, which would permit a major advance of such countries weapons systems. Specifies the conditions under which the Secretary of Commerce may require each type of export license. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to review periodically the availability outside the United States of goods or technology which require a validated export license and make certain adjustments. Requires the Secretary to establish a system of automatic annual increases in the performance levels of goods and technology required to have validated and qualified licenses in order to remove restrictions on those goods and technologies which are no longer detrimental to U.S. military security. Requires the Secretary to appoint technical advisory committees to advise the Secretary concerning export controls under this Act at the request of a substantial segment of any industry. Directs the President to enter into negotiations with the governments participating in the Coordinating Committee of the Consultative Group concerning export controls. Exempts countries participating in the Committee and receiving goods or technology subject to export controls from conditions limiting the further export of such goods. Requires U.S. citizens, who enter into agreements to export unpublished technical data to countries to which exports are restricted for national security purposes, to report such agreements to the Secretary. Makes the Secretary of State responsible for conducting negotiations with other countries to restrict the export of goods and technology detrimental to U.S. security. Authorizes the President, through the Secretary, to restrict the export of goods or technology necessary: (1) to further significantly U.S. foreign policy or international responsibilities; (2) to secure the removal of restrictions on access to supplies; or (3) to encourage other countries to prevent the use of their territories or resources to aid international terrorism, by means of export licenses. Gives the Secretary of State the right to review any export license and appeal any decision to the President. Sets forth the criteria for such controls. Requires consultation with the industry concerned and with Congress (giving Congress an opportunity to veto such control) before imposing such controls. Requires the President to first attempt to secure the objectives of this Act through diplomatic means. Excludes from such controls goods and technology which would help meet basic human needs. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish and maintain a list of goods subject to export controls for foreign policy purposes as part of the commodity control list. Sets forth the procedure for processing validated and qualified general export license applications. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to review any proposed exports to countries to which exports are controlled for national security purposes. Authorizes applicants for export licenses to file appeals with the Secretary and to bring court actions. Directs the Secretary to monitor exports which may have a serious adverse impact on the domestic economy. Exempts oil which is exchanged with an adjacent foreign state resulting in lower prices for U.S. consumers from the prohibition against exporting domestically produced crude oil. Repeals the two year limitation on such prohibition. Requires congressional approval before oil subject to such prohibition may be exported. Authorizes the President to export oil otherwise prohibited, pursuant to oil supply agreements. Directs the Secretary to require a validated license for the export of unprocessed western red cedar logs. Specifies quotas for the export of such logs. Declares standard aircraft equipment subject to export controls under the Export Administration Act of 1969. Increases the penalties for violations of such Act. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress concerning the administration of this Act. Authorizes the President and the Secretary to issue any necessary rules and regulations. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1980 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Terminates authority under this Act on September 30, 1983. Makes certain technical amendments to conform to the provisions of this Act. Title II: International Investment Survey Act - Amends the International Investment Survey Act of 1976 to authorize appropriations for such Act through fiscal year 1980."
