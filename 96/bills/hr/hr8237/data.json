    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide an additional $1,000 personal tax exemption for a taxpayer, spouse, or a dependent who is disabled. Defines \"disabled individual\" as one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such individual's major life activities and which can be expected to be fatal or has lasted or will last continuously for at least 12 months. Requires proof of such disability before a taxpayer may be considered disabled. Disallows the additional exemption if the taxpayer or spouse already receives an extra exemption due to blindness. Allows an income tax credit for day care expenses incurred with respect to a disabled individual who is not claimed as a dependent by any other taxpayer."
