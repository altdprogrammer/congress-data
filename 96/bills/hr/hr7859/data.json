Includes within such supplementary services English language instruction, bilingual education, special materials and supplies, additional basic instructional services, and inservice training. Sets forth State application requirements. Requires a State educational agency to give notice and an opportunity for a hearing before final disapproval of a local educational agency's application for such funds. =Title IV: Adult Education Programs= - Directs the Secretary to make payments to State agencies for fiscal years 1982-1983 for adult education programs for Cubans and Haitians aged 16 or more who are not enrolled in elementary or secondary school.
