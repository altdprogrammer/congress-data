    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to add to the scope of Federal permit authority with respect to discharges of dredged or fill material by requiring permits for such discharges into wetlands adjacent to navigable waters. Allows the discharge of such materials without a permit into waters other than navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Corps of Engineers, to enter into agreements with States to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters other than navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. Exempts farming, silviculture, ranching, forestry and specified construction activities from permit requirements with respect to discharges of dredged or fill material. Stipulates that Federal projects shall be exempt only if the effects of such discharges have been assessed pursuant to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Corps of Engineers, to delegate authority over dredged and fill material in adjacent wetlands to the States."
