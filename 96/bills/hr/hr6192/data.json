    "text": "Federal Computer Systems Protection Act of 1979 - Prohibits anyone from using or attempting to use a computer which: (1) is operated on behalf of the Federal Government or a financial institution (where the prohibited conduct directly affects the computer operation); or (2) operates in interstate commerce, with intent to defraud, obtain property by false pretenses, embezzle, steal, or knowingly convert the property of another. Sets the penalty for such offense at the higher of: (1) $50,000 or (2) two times the direct or indirect gain derived from the offense, and/or up to five years imprisonment. Specifies six factors which Federal law enforcement officers must consider in determining whether to exercise jurisdiction over such offense, where concurrent jurisdiction exists with a State or local government. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on the extent of the exercise of such Federal jurisdiction during the preceding fiscal year and to report within one year of enactment on the long-term impact of this Act and the use of computers in the United States upon Federal jurisdiction."
