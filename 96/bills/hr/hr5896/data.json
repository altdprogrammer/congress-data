    "text": "Indian Judgment Funds Act Amendments of 1979 - Amends the Indian Judgment Funds Act with respect to the use and distribution of judgment funds awarded by the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Claims. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit to Congress a plan for such use and distribution within one year after the appropriation of such funds. Requires the Secretary to submit a copy of such plan to the governing body or official representative of each affected tribe or group. Authorizes the Secretary to submit an alternate schedule to the Congress for submission of such plan, if he determines that the one-year deadline cannot be met. Allows a significant portion, but not less than 20 percent, of such awarded funds to be set aside for programming or investment by the affected tribe, with the approval of the Secretary. Provides that if a plan or schedule is disapproved by joint resolution, the disposition of such funds shall be subject to subsequently enacted legislation. Authorizes amendments to any such plan or withdrawal by the Secretary prior to its effective date and requires notice of any such action to the affected tribe or group and the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary, when any plan provides for per capita distribution of funds, to utilize funds under the plan to pay part or all of the cost of the preparation of a roll for such distribution."
