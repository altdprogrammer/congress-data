Defines \"fee\" to mean any money or other valuable consideration in excess of the actual cost of providing such services paid or promised to be paid to a person for services as a farm labor contractor. Eliminates from the definition of \"agricultural employment\" the handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, or grading prior to delivery for storage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state. Defines \"migrant worker\" to include an individual whose primary employment is in agriculture, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1939, on a seasonal or other temporary basis, or who performs agricultural labor, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, on a seasonal or other temporary basis and who is transported from and to his or her permanent domicile each work day in a vehicle owned or controlled by a farm labor contractor, or who cannot regularly return to his or her permanent domicile each day after working hours. Defines the terms \"transport\", \"bona fide full-time employee\", \"bona fide regular employee\", and \"agricultural cooperative\" for the purposes of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963. Eliminates the payroll records maintenance requirement for any person who is furnished any migrant worker by a farm labor contractor where the contractor pays the worker."
