Permits the authorized collective bargaining representative of employees adversely affected by the failure of the Secretary of Transportation to enforce any provision under the Act to bring an enforcement action in the appropriate district court of the United States. Prohibits any railroad from discharging, harassing, or discriminating against any railroad employee who seeks or becomes involved in any enforcement action against such railroad, or who refuses to work in an area which such employee believes presents an imminent danger to his health and safety. Establishes civil penalties for any violations. Prohibits Federal employees with authority to recommend or approve any personnel action in specified agencies from discriminating against any person on the basis of that person's holding collective reemployment rights or from requiring that such person relinquish those rights as a condition of employment. Establishes pay classifications for a railroad safety inspector and a railroad safety specialist. Amends the Hours of Service Act to require a common carrier to provide transportation for specified employees to the available lodging facility in order for such employees to arrive at such facility within 30 minutes after the time of interim release."
