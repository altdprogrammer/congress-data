Prohibits the release of such assets until all U.S. Claims against Iran have been paid. Specifies that U.S. claims be paid, first, from the accrued interest on such assets and, second, from the daily fine imposed until the hostages are returned. Provides for any remaining amounts to be distributed to those less developed countries suffering economic hardship resulting from the increasing costs of imported oil, unless Congress disapproves."
