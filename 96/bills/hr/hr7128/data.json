Directs the General Accounting Office, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to monitor the rate of reuse and recycling of beverage containers and to report to Congress on the impact of provisions of this Act on the industry, environmental effects, and the economy. Directs the Administrator of EPA to provide technical assistance and information to licensees, retailers, consumers, and manufacturers to assist in complying with provisions of this Act concerning refundable beverage containers. Declares that the provisions of this Act shall apply to contracts or agreements already in effect and those entered into subsequent to its enactment."
