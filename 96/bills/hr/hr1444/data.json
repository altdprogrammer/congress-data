    "text": "Older Americans Education and Employment Act - Title I: Reduced Education Costs for Older Americans - Permits any institution of higher education to submit to the Commissioner of Education a plan for the reduction of education costs for older persons (aged 60 or over). Limits such reduction to 50 percent of the normal cost of study at such institution. Requires the Commissioner to determine whether or not to approve such plan. Prohibits any plan from being approved unless the institution agrees to: (1) transmit reports to the Commissioner; (2) keep sufficient records; (3) make assurances of effective fiscal control; and (4) comply with rules set forth by the Commissioner. Makes any older person eligible to receive reduced tuition rates at any qualified institution. Allows any higher education institution whose plan is approved to receive reimbursement for the reduced tuition rates. Title II: Employment Opportunities for Older Americans - Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a system for the collection of data for vacancies in jobs for older persons, and such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate to identify employment opportunities for older persons. Requires the Secretary to establish a computerized job data bank for older persons."
