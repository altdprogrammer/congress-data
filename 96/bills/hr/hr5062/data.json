States that it is the continuing policy of Government to use all practicable means to stabilize the nation's population voluntarily at a level consistent with a high standard of living relative to available resources at the earliest possible time. Creates in the Executive Office of the President an Office of Population Policy (Office) to: (1) submit to the President and Congress studies on the current conditions and trends in changes affecting population; (2) review legislation and Government regulations to determine the extent to which they contribute to the population policy set forth in this Act; (3) recommend national policies to plan for population changes and to promote population stabilization; and (4) document, define, and analyze changes in the nation's population. Sets forth the powers of the Director of the Office who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. Requires the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States to be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act. Directs each Federal agency to: (1) develop methods to ensure that population changes and the goal of population stabilization are considered in decisionmaking; (2) make available information which is useful to population planning; (3) assist the Office; (4) review its statutory authority; regulations, and current policies and procedures to determine whether they comply with the policies of this Act; and (5) propose to Congress and the President such measures as may be necessary to bring the agency into compliance. Requires the President to transmit to Congress annually a National Population Change and Planning Report. Specifies that such report set forth: (1) the status and trends of population changes; (2) the adequacy of available natural resources for fulfilling national requirements considering current and foreseeable population change; (3) a review of all legislation, regulations, programs, and activities affecting planning for population change and stabilization; and (4) a program for remedying the deficiencies of such legislation, regulations, programs, and activities."
