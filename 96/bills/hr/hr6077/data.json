    "text": "Federal Employees Dental Benefits Act of 1979 - Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract for the following dental benefits plans for Federal employees (including United States Postal Service employees): (1) a service benefit plan; (2) an indemnity benefit plan; (3) employee organization plans; and (4) health maintenance organization plans. Requires that the benefits under such plans include: (1) diagnostic services; (2) preventive care; (3) emergency dental care services; (4) fillings; and (5) extractions. Permits a plan, subject to approval of the OPM, to: (1) offer additional benefits; (2) require copayments not exceeding 50 percent of the value of such additional benefits; (3) limit the amount a beneficiary may be paid during a calendar year under such a plan; and (4) impose a calendar year deductible for each beneficiary. Allows the OPM to enter into contracts for such plans without regard to specified provisions of Federal law requiring competitive bidding. Sets forth requirements concerning: (1) the length and rates of such a contract; and (2) obligations of any carrier of such a plan. States that such contracts are not subject to the Federal Procurement Regulations. Directs the OPM to establish audit requirements which do not conflict with such regulations to carry out the purposes of this Act. Allows an employee to enroll in a dental benefits plan as an individual or for self and family. Permits certain annuitants to continue enrollment in such a plan under conditions of eligibility prescribed by regulations of the OPM. Prohibits an individual from enrolling both as an employee or annuitant and as a member of the family. Specifies conditions under which an employee may change enrollment. Specifies the biweekly contributions of the Government and the enrolled individual toward the subscription charge of a dental benefits plan. Directs the OPM to provide individuals who are eligible for such a plan with sufficient information to enable the individual to make an informed choice among the types of plans. Requires that each enrolled individual receive a document summarizing: (1) the benefits of the plans; (2) the procedure for obtaining benefits; and (3) all provisions of the plan affecting the individual. Creates the Employees Dental Benefits Fund into which the contributions of the Government and enrolled individuals shall be paid. Directs the OPM to: (1) administer this Act; (2) make a continuing study of the operation of this Act and of the plans under this Act; and (3) transmit an annual report of its findings to Congress. Authorizes expenditures from the Employees Life Insurance Fund to pay administrative expenses of the OPM in carrying out provisions of this Act. Requires the reimbursement of such expenditures plus interest from the Federal Employees Dental Benefits Fund."
