    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal provisions which require tax-exempt private foundations with assets of $5,000 or more to make annual reports of their receipts and expenditures. Requires that information previously required by such annual reports be included in the foundation's annual tax return. Imposes the same reporting requirements on non tax-exempt charitable trusts and private foundations. Requires that such returns be opened to public inspection and imposes a fine for failure to do so. Permits private foundations to treat as confidential, and not to list on their tax returns, the name and address of any indigent or needy recipient of charitable gifts or grants amounting to $1,000 or less during the taxable year. Permits certain Government officials to accept payment from private foundations of limited traveling expenses between a point in the United States and a point outside the United States without being subject to the tax on self-dealing. Provides that charitable contributions attributable to charitable corporate trusts shall be treated as deductions from gross income for purposes of determining the minimum tax liability for adjusted itemized deductions. Permits the voluntary withholding of income taxes from sick pay under employer wage continuation plans. Excludes from gross income repayments of unemployment benefits, in the year of repayment, to a supplemental unemployment compensation trust which are required because of trade adjustment allowances under the Trade Act of 1974. Permits State taxing authorities which receive Federal tax return information to disclose such information to a State auditing agency for the purpose of auditing the tax authorities. Qualifies property used by the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, the International Maritime Satellite Organization, and any successor organizations, for the investment tax credit. Amends the Second Liberty Bond Act to allow the interest rates paid on United States retirement plan and individual retirement bonds to be increased so that the investment yield on such bonds is consistent with the yield on new offerings of such bonds."
