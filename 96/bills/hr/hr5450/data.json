Specifies that there shall be no exceptions to the prohibitions of such Act because of the nature of employment of an individual, or retirement benefits to which an individual may be entitled. Repeals provisions restricting the employment or compensation of an individual in the Federal civil service, Government of the District of Columbia, Foreign Service, or Army Corps of Engineers after such individual retires with an annuity or reaches retirement age. Repeals automatic separation requirements based on age and length of service which relate to employees of the Alaska Railroad, the Panama Canal Company, the Canal Zone Government, and to air traffic controllers and Federal law enforcement officers and firefighters."
