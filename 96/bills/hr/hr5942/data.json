    "text": "Congressional Review of Administrative Rules Act - Requires any executive agency which publishes a rule in the Federal Register to submit a copy of such rule to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Declares that the rule shall become effective 60 days after it is published unless (1) either House of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving it, or (2) it is withdrawn by such agency. Prohibits an agency from publishing a rule containing language which is identical to language of a disapproved rule without congressional authorization. Permits a rule to take effect on the date it is published if the responsible agency determines that a delay in the effective date would seriously harm a person or property without serving the public interest. Declares that such a rule shall be effective unless (1) either House of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving it or (2) it is terminated by the agency. Sets forth House and Senate procedure for consideration of such resolutions of disapproval."
