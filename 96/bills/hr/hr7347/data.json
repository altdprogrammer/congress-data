    "text": "Citizen Privacy Act of 1980 - Title I: Rights of Privacy of Individual Citizens - Prohibits the installation or use of any two-way mirror in any place reasonably expected to be frequented by the public, including fitting rooms, motel rooms, and restrooms, unless an appropriate notice is conspicuously displayed in or near such place. Establishes criminal penalties for violations and allows a United States district court to grant equitable relief. Allows any individual, who purchases or contracts to purchase any product or service at a cost of $25 or more from any solicitor at such individual's residence, to cancel such transaction for any reason and without penalty within three business days by providing written notice to such solicitor. Prohibits cancellation in certain instances, including a contracted-for service which has been completely performed. Title II: Telephone Privacy - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any unsolicited commercial telephone call to any telephone if the subscriber for such telephone has notified the telephone company of a desire not to receive such calls. Prohibits any person from causing to be made any unsolicited commercial telephone call which is made entirely by automatic equipment and has or may have a duration of more than one minute. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe appropriate notice regulations. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of this title."
