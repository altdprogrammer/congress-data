Increases from 50,000 to 100,000 the number of members of the Selected Reserve who may be ordered to active duty other than during a war or national emergency. Amends the Selective Service Act to remove the requirement that armed forces Reserve officers ordered to active duty for training be so ordered for not less than three months. Sets forth the levels of senior enlisted personnel which may be on active duty in support of reserve components. Excludes such members when computing the authorized daily average of other such personne."
