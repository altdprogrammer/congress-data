    "text": "Federal Petroleum Production Control Act - Repeals the Connally Hot Oil Act which prohibits the shipment or transportation in interstate commerce of petroleum and its constituent parts which was produced, transported, or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amounts permitted under the laws or regulations of a State. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to determine the maximum efficient rate of production and the temporary emergency production rate for each field, whether or not on Federal lands, which produces or is determined to be capable of producing significant volumes of crude oil. Authorizes the Secretary, under such Act, to require crude oil production from fields designated by the Secretary: (1) at a rate not in excess of the maximum efficient rate of production; or (2) at the temporary emergency production rate during a severe energy supply interruption. Transfers to the Secretary of Energy from the Secretary of the Interior the duty of making the determination required by this Act with respect to crude oil production and by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with respect to the production of natural gas on any field on Federal lands."
