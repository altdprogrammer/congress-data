Requires the certification of such agreements to be deposited in the National Archives and published in the Federal Register. States that such agreement shall determine the location of such boundary. Title II: Authorizes the United States or the State to propose to immobilize an entire boundary which has been specifically described by one or more final decrees and agreements. Sets forth the procedures for the proposal and notification of such immobilization. Title III: Directs the Attorney General, whenever a State waives its right to the nonliving natural resources of the seabed or subsoil it would otherwise accrue as a result of changes in any portion of its coastline, to deposit such waiver in the National Archives and have it published in the Federal Register. Title IV: States that no boundary established pursuant to this Act will affect the territorial sea of the United States or the baseline from which the breadth of such sea is measured. Limits the applicability of the boundaries established pursuant to this Act to the exploration for and exploitation of nonliving natural resources of the seabed and subsoil."
