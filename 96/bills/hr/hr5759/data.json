Conditions such adjustment on the adoption of a concurrent resolution by each House of Congress. Requires the vote on such resolution to be recorded to reflect the vote of each Member. Prohibits any congressional employee from being paid at a rate in excess of the rate payable for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives. Requires the President to transmit to the Congress, within the first 15 days of January after the date on which the report and recommendations, concerning salaries, of the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries are required to be submitted, his recommendations with respect to the rates of pay of Members of Congress, legislative, and judicial employees. Prohibits the House of Representatives and the Senate from considering any bill or joint resolution carrying an appropriation for compensation of Members of Congress for any fiscal year if such bill or joint resolution carries an appropriation or a limitation on appropriations for any other purpose."
