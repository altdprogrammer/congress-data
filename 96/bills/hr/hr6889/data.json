    "text": "(Senate vitiated its action on passage of 11/20/80) Methane Transportation Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to designate an organizational entity within the Department of Energy to manage the methane vehicle research, development, and demonstration program established under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, or any other Federal agency, providing that such agencies conduct specified aspects of such program as the Secretary deems appropriate. States that, the Secretary shall have responsibility to ascertain that such program includes activities to: (1) promote research on methane-fueled vehicles; (2) conduct research and development on optimum overall specifications for such vehicles; (3) determine means and facilities for storing, transporting, and dispensing methane for use as vehicular fuel; (4) conduct demonstration projects with respect to the feasibility of such vehicles; (5) gather performance data on such vehicles; and related methane transmission and storage facilities; (6) determine that demonstration projects have an adequate supply of methane for vehicular use; (7) ascertain the need for modifying available methane-fueled vehicles in order to facilitate their use by fleet owners; and (8) report to the Congress on any changes in fuel supply patterns, tax policies, and manufacturing standards needed to facilitate the manufacture and use of such vehicles. Directs the Secretary to insure that the conduct of the research and development program of this Act: (1) supplements the automotive propulsion systems research and development efforts of private industry; (2) will not supplant or lessen private industry's research and development; and (3) avoids duplication of private research and development. Directs the Secretary to assure maximum coordination between Federal agencies and the Department of Energy in carrying out such program. Directs the Secretary to initiate and provide for research and development in areas relating to such vehicles, including: (1) flammability and combustibility of methane; (2) handling, storage and distribution of methane; (3) the efficiency of recovering methane from unconventional sources; (4) vehicle design and construction; (5) the nature of emissions; and (6) overcoming institutional barriers to widespread use. Directs the Secretary, by January 1, 1982, to develop data on the current state-of-the-art, with respect to methane-fueled vehicles to serve as baseline data for evaluating technological improvements. Directs the Secretary to promulgate guidelines for demonstrations and to issue an initial request for proposals for technical and financial assistance to support public and private entities in developing and implementing demonstration projects to gather data on the operation of such vehicles and methane transmission, storage, and dispensing facilities. Sets forth the types of technical and financial assistance to be provided under this Act, including grants and loans to cover specified percentages of the costs associated with the installation of methane transmission, storage, and dispensing facilities. Sets forth requirements as to the number and duration of such demonstrations.
