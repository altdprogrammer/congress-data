    "text": "Replacement Motor Fuels and Oil Pricing Controls Extension Act of 1979 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to promote the development and use of replacement fuels in the United States for the purpose of replacing gasoline used as a motor fuel. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Transportation, Commerce and other appropriate agencies, to conduct a study to determine: (1) the most suitable raw materials for the production of such replacement fuels, other than petroleum or natural gas; (2) the nature of the replacement fuels distribution systems and production processes; (3) the feasibility of using liquids extracted from oil shale and coal; and (4) the feasibility of reaching by the year 1990 a production goal for replacement fuels of 20 percent by volume of the projected consumption of gasoline used as a motor fuel. Directs the Secretary of Energy to set production goals for replacement fuels for each of calendar years 1981 through 1985, and establishes as a production goal for such fuels for years thereafter at ten percent by volume of projected U.S. gasoline consumption. Directs the Secretary to prescribe by rule the percentage of replacement fuel by volume to be contained in the total quantity of gasoline sold annually in commerce in the United States in calendar years 1981 through 1984 by any refiner for use as a motor fuel. Sets forth provisions for the enforcement of such requirements. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $1,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Extends the provisions of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 relating to Federal controls on oil pricing."
