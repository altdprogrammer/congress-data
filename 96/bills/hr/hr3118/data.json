    "text": "Freestone Peach Research and Education Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a plan for financing and carrying out a research and education program with respect to freestone peaches. Requires that such plan: (1) establish a National Freestone Peach Research and Education Board to administer it; (2) fix the rate of assessments levied upon producers of freestone peaches (and collected for the Board by handlers) for research and education programs; (3) provide for the pro rata return of up to 50 percent of the net proceeds of such assessments to the States, for State projects; and (4) permit any freestone peach producer not in favor of the programs so supported to receive a refund of his or her assessment. Specifies permissive terms in such a plan. Prescribes civil penalties for handlers who violate this Act. Grants investigative and subpena powers to the Secretary for the enforcement of any plan the Secretary issues. Requires the Secretary to conduct a referendum of producers to ascertain approval of the plan issued. Denies effect to such plan if it fails to receive the approval of at least two-thirds of the producers voting in such a referendum, provided at least 50 percent of the registered producers cast votes. Provides a procedure for the suspension or termination of such a plan."
