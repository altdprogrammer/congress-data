Stipulates that any rule or regulation of the Agency promulgated on or before June 1, 1979, shall cease to have any force and effect upon disapproval by either House of Congress. Prohibits the Administrator from taking any enforcement action against any person for failure to comply with any standard or requirement of the Agency when such person submits proof that such compliance will require the closing of all or part of any facility owned or operated by him, unless both Houses of Congress have by resolution approved such enforcement action. Requires the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to report to the House of Representatives by January 1, 1981, the results of a complete and comprehensive review of all laws, rules, and regulations enforced by the Agency to determine the impact and extent to which such laws, rules, and regulations have contributed to, or exacerbated, the current energy crisis."
