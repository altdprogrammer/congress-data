Permits such an alien to change his/her designated course of medical study upon approval of the Director of the International Communication Agency once within two years after entry or acquisition of exchange visitor status (presently must continue course of education under which admitted to the United States). Makes such duration of stay and course change provisions applicable to those aliens entering the United States on or after January 10, 1978. Extends the waiver authority regarding such aliens from December 31, 1980, to December 31, 1983."
