    "date": "1979-12-04", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended (inserted text of H. R. 5297), roll call #698 (398-9)) =Title I: Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1980= - Establishes authorization ceilings for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be used for nuclear reactor regulation, inspection and enforcement, standards development, nuclear material safety and safeguards, nuclear regulatory research, program technical support, and program direction and administration. Limits the Commission's authority to reprogram such funds by an increase or decrease in excess of $500,000 for a period of 30 calendar days after notifying the appropriate committees of Congress, unless each committee has transmitted a written notice stating it has no objections to the proposed action. Directs the Commission to establish a Senior Contract Review Board to review placements or modifications of contracts with Federal agencies or for research services in excess of $500,000, with any such contract in excess of $1,000,000 being approved by a majority vote of the Commission. Authorizes the Commission to retain moneys received for cooperative nuclear research programs for salaries and expenses for such programs and to transfer sums from salaries and expenses to other government agencies which perform work for which the appropriation was made. Authorizes the Commission to use authorized funds necessary to: (1) establish standards for State radiological emergency plans for any facility required to be licensed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; (2) review all plans and other preparations respecting such an emergency which have been made by each State and which may be in some way affected by such emergency; (3) assess the adequacy of such plans and the ability of the States involved to effectuate emergency evacuations; (4) identify which States do not have adequate preparations and notify the Governor forthwith; (5) submit a report to Congress containing the results and recommendations after such process; (6) submit specified information on safety issues regarding operating nuclear reactors; and (7) submit a report reviewing and assessing the emergency response capability of nuclear plants now operating or under construction, including a determination of the maximum zone around each reactor which could be evacuated at various warning times. Directs the Commission to promulgate regulations requiring that timely notice be provided to the Governor of a State prior to the transportation of nuclear waste to, through, or across the boundaries of such State. Prohibits the use of funds to grant any license, permit, or other authorization to any person for the transportation to or the storage of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste on any territory or insular possession of the United States or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands unless the President: (1) submits a report to the Congress at least 30 days prior to such transfer; or (2) determines that an emergency exists requiring such transfer and notifies the Congress as soon as possible thereafter. Directs the Commission to develop revised employee training and certification standards to insure that nuclear powerplant personnel are adequately trained to operate the plant safely and to detect and respond to radiological emergencies. =Title II: Authority to Make Payments= - Authorizes payments under this Act only to the extent such amounts are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. =Title III:= - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 by increasing the maximum civil penalty which the Commission can impose for single license violations from $5,000 to $100,000, and removing the maximum total penalty ceiling. Amends such Act to authorize the Commission to protect certain unclassified but sensitive nuclear safeguards information from public disclosure. Subjects violators of regulations or orders issued to prevent such disclosures to civil monetary penalties. Makes sabotage of a nuclear facility a Federal offense punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. =Title IV: Protection for Inspectors= - Makes attacks on construction or quality assurance inspectors on any Commission licensed project a Federal offense punishable by fines and/or imprisonment."
