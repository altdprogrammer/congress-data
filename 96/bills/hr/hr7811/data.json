Repeals the requirement that, as a condition of their employment, such individuals reside in a hardship area. Reduces from 17 to 11 months the residency requirement for such exclusion. Waives such requirement if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such individuals were required to leave a foreign country because of war, civil unrest, or other adverse conditions before the end of the 11 month period, and that they would have otherwise met such residency requirement. Provides for an income tax exclusion for the value of employer-provided lodging in a camp in cases where satisfactory housing is not generally available. Reduces from 17 to 11 months the foreign residency requirement with respect to the deduction for certain housing expenses of living abroad."
