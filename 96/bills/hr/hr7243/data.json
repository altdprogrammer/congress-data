Limits such exemption to scholarships: (1) that are not taxable expenditures; (2) when at least one-half of the scholarships awarded during the calendar year by such foundation are for the same or a greater amount than the particular scholarship concerned; (3) when the manager is not a disqualified person for any other reason; (4) when eligibility for all scholarships is determined by an objective test based on scholastic achievement, and application of such test does not involve substantial discretion on the part of any manager; and (5) when not more than three percent of the aggregate amount of scholarships awarded are awarded to lineal descendants (or spouses of lineal descendants) of any foundation managers."
