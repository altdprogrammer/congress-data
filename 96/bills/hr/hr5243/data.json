    "text": "National Fishery Development Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer moneys made available to encourage exportation and domestic consumption of agricultural products to the Secretary of Commerce in amounts equal to 30 percent of the gross receipts from duties collected under customs laws on fishery products. Declares that such funds shall be maintained in a separate fund and used by the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) carry out a national program of fisheries research and development which promotes the free flow of domestically produced fishery products in domestic and international commerce by conducting fishery educational, technological, biological, and related research programs; and (2) provide financial assistance for fisheries development projects. Allows any person, regional fishery development foundation, or organization involved with the commercial fishing industry to make application to the Secretary of Commerce for such funds. Requires the person or organization obtaining such funds to submit periodic project status reports to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to include as part of the annual report to the National Marine Fisheries Service an analysis and evaluation of all programs funded under this Act. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to transmit to specified House and Senate committees, 60 days in advance of each fiscal year, a list of projects and a budget for each project which is proposed under this Act. Requires that not less than 50 percent of the moneys in the fund shall be made available annually to fund the fisheries development projects, and that the remainder of such moneys be made available to implement the national fisheries research and development program. Declares that moneys not obligated shall remain in the fund without fiscal year limitation. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to appoint not fewer than six officers who shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, serve abroad to promote United States fishing interests. Requires the Secretary of State, upon the request of the Secretary of Commerce, to officially assign the officers to the diplomatic mission of the United States in the country in which such officers are placed, and to obtain for them diplomatic privileges and immunities. Transfers any balance of funds remaining in the fisheries loan fund created by the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, as of September 30, 1980, to the Federal Ship Financing Fund established under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide for the guarantee of obligations relating to fishing vessels engaged in developing fisheries which might not otherwise meet the normal economic soundness criteria established under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936."
