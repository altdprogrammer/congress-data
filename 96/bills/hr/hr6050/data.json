Establishes the Office of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment in place of the existing office of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment. Title II: Health and Psychological Care - Establishes a presumption of service-connected disability for certain diseases arising in Vietnam-era veterans (and for birth defects in their children) exposed to agent orange. Authorizes specified mental health care for eligible Vietnam-era veterans at community health centers. Directs the Comptroller General to assign ombudsmen (from the General Accounting Office) at each Veterans' Administration hospital to investigate patient complaints. Title III: GI Bill Assistance - Extends the educational assistance delimiting period for certain Vietnam-era veterans. Eliminates the requirement of matching State funds for accelerated educational loan payments. Increases such maximum payment amounts. Title IV: Administrative Costs for State Home Loan Programs - Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to pay the initial administrative expenses for a qualifying State veterans' home loan program. Title V: Commission to Study Veterans' Benefits - Establishes the Commission on Veterans' Benefits to perform a comprehensive study of the structure and administration of the laws relating to veterans' benefits. States that such Commission shall report its findings within 18 months to the President and the Congress, and cease to exist 30 days after such submission."
