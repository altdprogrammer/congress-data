Authorizes a State court with jurisdiction to modify a custody determination of another State court which no longer has or has declined to exercise jurisdiction. Amends title IV (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Security Act to include as a function of the Parent Locator Service the provision of information to authorized persons about any absent parent or child for the enforcement of a child custody determination or with regard to parental kidnapping. Prohibits the intentional restraint of a child in violation of any other person's right of custody or visitation arising from a State custody determination. Specifies (1) the jurisdictional basis for such offense, including the willful transportation of a child in interstate commerce, and (2) Federal investigation procedures."
