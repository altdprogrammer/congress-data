    "date": "1979-04-24", 
    "text": "Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to direct the Southwest Border Regional Commission to make grants to eligible local educational agencies for school facilities construction to assist such agencies in providing education to immigrant children. Authorizes additional appropriations of up to $45,000,000 for such purposes. Requires a local education agency to be eligible for assistance to have: (1) at least 20 immigrant children; and (2) a minimum enrollment of seven percent immigrant children. Stipulates that an immigrant child, guardian, or parent must live within a school district of such agency to be counted for eligibility purposes. Stipulates that a local educational agency shall receive $1,000 for each immigrant child for whom such agency provided free public education during the 1978-1979 school year. Requires a local educational agency to submit an application for such assistance, and sets forth guidelines for such application. Defines the term immigrant child for purposes of this Act as a child born in Mexico and who has legally immigrated to the United States, or a child whose parents are legal immigrants from Mexico, and who is provided free public education."
