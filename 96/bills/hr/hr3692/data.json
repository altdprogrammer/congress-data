    "text": "Nuclear Waste Transportation Safety Act of 1979 - Declares it the policy of Congress that the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, (NRC) has principal responsibility for the transportation of nuclear waste and radioactive commercial spent fuel. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to define the terms used in such Act. Designates commercial spent fuel and transuranic waste in quantities greater than one kilogram as hazardous material. Sets forth the responsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation concerning nuclear materials transportation. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the NRC, to formulate and send to Congress a national emergency response plan to deal with emergency situations that may occur during the shipment of radioactive material. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to any State to assist it in conducting a review of the safety and logistics of shipment associated with any proposal to develop a long-term storage or disposal facility which would result in nuclear waste or commercial spent fuel being shipped within the State. Limits grants to $50,000. Sets forth notification procedures for the acceptance of nuclear waste or commercial spent fuel from any non-domestic source. Requires the annual report on the transportation of hazardous materials to include the following items relating to radioactive materials: (1) a review of shipment safety requirements; (2) a compilation of data to aid in risk assessment; (3) recommendations for Federal routing guidelines or requirements; and (4) an assessment of the Nation's inventory of containers, packages, and vehicles suitable for the shipment of nuclear waste or commercial spent fuel. Authorizes the appropriation of $6,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, and for each of the two succeeding fiscal years. Allocates the funds within such Act."
