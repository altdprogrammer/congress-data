Stipulates that such service may include periods of active duty, active duty for training, and other active or inactive service. Increases the maximum number of such scholarship recipients in the Army program from 6,500 to 12,000. Authorizes additional scholarships to be awarded to eligible students at a military junior college. Defines \"military junior college\" as a civilian postsecondary educational institution essentially military in nature that does not confer baccalaureate degrees and that meets other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Army. Establishes eligibility criteria for such scholarship recipients, including: (1) United States citizenship; (2) enlistment in an Army Reserve unit; and (3) service as a commissioned officer in the Army Reserve or the National Guard for at least six years. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to order a scholarship recipient who does not complete the course of instruction, or who refused to accept a commission upon completion of instruction, to serve on active duty for up to four years. Authorizes the Secretary to delay the commencement of such Reserve service until completion of a graduate or undergraduate degree."
