Directs the Comptroller General of the United States: (1) in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to establish a method of reporting and a general framework to guide the agencies in evaluating their systems of internal accounting and administrative control, and to modify such method or framework as necessary; and (2) to define internal accounting and administrative controls to provide assurances that: (a) obligations and costs were in compliance with applicable law; (b) funds, property, and other assets were safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and (c) agency revenues and expenditures were properly accounted for and recorded. Requires any inadequacy in the agency's systems which prevents the systems from achieving such assurances to be identified, and a plan for correcting such an inadequacy to be described in detail. Requires the Inspector General or the head of the internal audit staff of each agency to receive and investigate any allegation that an agency employee provided false or misleading information in connection with an evaluation or report concerning the agency's accounting or control systems. Directs the head of an agency to take action against such an employee as necessary."
