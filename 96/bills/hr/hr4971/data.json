    "text": "Truck Safety Act - Stipulates that the provisions of this Act shall apply to all commercial motor vehicles over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (except vehicles engaged in farming or logging operations). Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish, maintain, and monitor safety rules and regulations to assure that: (1) commercial motor vehicles are safely maintained, equipped, loaded, and operated; (2) the responsibilities imposed upon drivers of such vehicles do not impair a driver's ability to operate such vehicle safely; and (3) the health and physical condition of such drivers will be adequate to enable them to drive the vehicles they operate. Directs the Secretary to regulate the working conditions and operating practices of employees of commercial motor vehicle carriers and to establish safety and health regulations with regard to such individuals. Directs the Secretary to conduct research, development, demonstration, and training activities to develop such rules and regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to require persons subject to this Act to maintain such records and make such reports as are necessary to insure compliance with this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the manner, type, and frequency of medical examinations to be provided by an employer to employees exposed to health or safety hazards. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct investigations and inspections without notice to enforce this Act. Requires the Secretary to timely investigate nonfrivolous complaints alleging a material violation of safety or health rules or regulations. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for such violations. Provides for judicial review of final orders with respect to such alleged violations. Prohibits an employer from discriminating or taking punitive actions against employees who complain of health or safety violations, who participate in any proceeding regarding such alleged violations, or who refuse to operate a vehicle when to do so would materially violate motor carrier safety violations. Requires States which agree to enforce this Act to submit an enforcement plan to the Secretary for approval. Sets forth requirements which must be included in any such plan. Authorizes appropriations, out of the Highway Fund for each fiscal year, of such sums as are required to provide incentive assistance to States to develop and institute such enforcement plans. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to the Congress regarding current plans to upgrade commercial motor vehicle safety and driver safety and health. Directs the Secretary to submit a report to Congress within 12 months regarding the advisability of establishing a national commercial vehicle driver register to upgrade safety through improved monitoring of traffic accidents and violations and of multiple State licensing. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt State commercial motor vehicle safety standards or regulations from the provisions of this Act under specified conditions. Authorizes appropriations in such sums as Congress may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
