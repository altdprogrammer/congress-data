    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-03-21", 
    "text": "Health Planning Amendments of 1979 - Title I: Three-Year Authorization Extensions - Amends title XV of the Public Health Service Act (National Health Planning and Development) to extend the authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for planning grants to health systems agencies (HSAs) and grants to State health planning and development agencies (State Agencies) for operational costs and rate regulation. Title II: Amendments to Health Planning Authorities - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to revise health service area boundaries if the boundaries of the proposed health service area would better meet the current requirements for such areas. Subjects the budget, health systems plan, and annual implementation plan developed by the governing body of an HSA which is a public regional planning body or single unit of general local government to approval by such planning body or government unit. Provides that records and meetings of an HSA except for personnel matters shall be available to the public. Stipulates that consumers on HSA governing bodies cannot have been \"direct\" health care providers within the 12 months preceding appointment, instead of \"health care providers\" as currently provided. Requires an HSA to review triennially, rather than annually, its health systems plan. Requires the State Agency to revise triennially the preliminary State health plan and the Statewide Health Coordinating Council (SHCC) to revise triennially the State health plan. Authorizes the Secretary to designate conditionally for up to two years an HSA or a State Agency which has not had its designation agreement renewed. Allows the carry-over of unobligated grants to HSAs and State Agencies to the succeeding fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary to determine the amount of any grant to designated HSAs (thus eliminating the current formula for such grants). Authorizes the Secretary to extend the conditional designation of a State Agency for a period longer than the current three-year limit, where such Agency is found to be making a good faith effort to meet the State Agency functions. Replaces the current penalty provision for States which do not have a designated State Agency after a certain period (which eliminates funding under specified Acts) with a graduated scheme which reduces by 25 percent such funding on an annual basis. Applies the State certificate of need program which a State Agency must administer to major medical equipment, in addition to new institutional health services as currently provided. Redefines \"institutional health services\" to exclude health maintenance organizations. Requires that the services and facilities to be offered or developed in the State under the certificate of need program be consistent with the State health plan. Requires the State Agencies in reviewing existing institutional health services to make public institution by institution findings concerning services specified by the Secretary, with respect to the appropriateness of such services. Repeals the requirement that State Agencies make findings as to the need of new institutional health services. Makes the representation of HSAs on the Statewide Health Coordinating Council proportional to the share of the State's population in the agency's health service area (instead of equal as currently provided). Authorizes the Governor of the State to: (1) select, or direct the SHCC members to select, the SHCC chairman; and (2) modify the State health plan and the health systems plans after consultation with the SHCC and a public statement of the reasons. Requires the review by HSAs and State Agencies of health maintenance organization services to be consistent with standards and procedures established by the Secretary pursuant to title XIII of the Public Health Service Act (Health Maintenance Organizations). Makes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico subject to the special, rather than the general, provisions of title XV. Title III: Assistance to Hospitals for Discontinuing Inappropriate Inpatient Services and for State Decertification Programs - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to: (1) public or private nonprofit hospitals to assist them in discontinuing inpatient hospital services which the Secretary determines are inappropriate; and (2) State Agencies for planning and carrying out programs to decertify health care facilities providing health services which are inappropriate."
