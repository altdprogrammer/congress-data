Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of authorized funds for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of, Congress unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to all the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement as specified. Imposes specified limits on the costs of general plant projects and construction projects. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Federal agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made.
