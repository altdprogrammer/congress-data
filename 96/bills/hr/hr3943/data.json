Limits the responsibility of the beneficiary to the lesser of $2,000 or 15 percent of the beneficiary's adjusted gross income for the three previous taxable years. Exempts from the limitations imposed by this Act contracts in effect at the time of the enactment of this Act and contracts which were part of a collective bargaining agreement in effect at that time."
