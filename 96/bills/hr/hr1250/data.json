Directs the Secretary of Labor, upon the request of the President, resolution of either House of Congress, application of a representative of an employee organization, or other interested party, or upon its own motion, to determine whether a product: (1) was produced abroad under labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of a minimum standard of living for workers; and (2) is impairing domestic labor of the communities. Authorizes the President to take remedial action if it is found that the product is in competition with domestic goods under such circumstances."
