    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income tax credit of 25 percent of the qualified research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with his trade or business. Defines \"qualified research and experimental expenditures\" as those business-related expenditures which are currently deductible under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, but limits the scope of such expenditures to technological research designed to develop or improve products or services. Excludes expenditures for research or experimentation in the social sciences or humanities, government-funded research, or research carried on in the taxpayer's behalf. Limits the amount of expenditures eligible for the credit to those which exceed 100 percent of the annual average of such expenditures for the immediately preceding three years. Provides for a three-year carryback and seven-year carryover of unused credits."
