Limits the coastwise trade for such vessels to the carrying of passengers, their accompanying baggage, and 1,000 measurement tons of cargo per annum. Authorizes the steamship vessel =United States= to engage in the coastwise and foreign commerce of the United States or between foreign ports so long as the vessel's coastwise trade is limited to the carriage of passengers, their baggage, and 1,000 measurement tons of cargo per annum. Permits the steamships =Mariposa= and =Monterey=, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, to remain under the American flag and operate totally in both the coastwise and foreign commerce of the United States and/or between foreign ports. Limits the vessel's domestic trade to the carriage of passengers, their baggage, and 1,000 measurement tons of cargo per annum."
