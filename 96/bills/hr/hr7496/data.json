    "text": "Title I: Fish Restoration Fund - Amends the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act to: (1) define the term \"coastal State\" for the purposes of such Act; and (2) authorize appropriations in the amount equal to the revenue accruing from taxes relating to sport fishing equipment and certain recreational boats and boating equipment for fiscal year 1980 and each fiscal year thereafter. Title II: Fish Restoration Program - Increases the percentage of the annual appropriation deducted for administrative expenses. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in the case of any State which makes available to nonresidents of the State who are 65 years of age or older free licenses for sport fishing within the State, to pay to such State a specified amount for each fiscal year. Sets forth the apportionment ratio to be used in distributing funds among the States under the fish restoration program. Authorizes the Secretary to expend unobligated funds to carry out the purposes of this Act. Eliminates the notification by a State of intent to accept such apportionment funds requirement. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to finance up to 75 percent of the costs of the acquisition of lands or interests therein and the construction of structures or facilities. Permits each State to utilize up to ten percent of its apportionment for an aquatic resource education program. Title III: Tax on Sale of Sport Fishing Equipment and Certain Recreational Boats and Boating Equipment - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to specify types of sport fishing equipment subject to the ten percent manufacturers excise tax."
