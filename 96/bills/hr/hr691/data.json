Prevents such rules from becoming effective if disapproved by either House of Congress within such 60-day period. Permits disapproval of emergency rules. Prohibits the submission to Congress of any rule identical to one which has been disapproved unless submitted pursuant to new legislative authority which has been enacted affecting the agency's powers with respect to the subject matter of such rule. Renders agency rules dealing with emergency or routine matters or which will have an insignificant impact effective without publication of advance notice of proposed rulemaking proceedings in the Federal Register as is currently required. Renders any rule granting an exemption to another rule or which is exempt from public notice and comment requirements effective immediately."
