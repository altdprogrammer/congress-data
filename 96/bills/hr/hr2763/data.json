Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to classify arson as a major crime in the Uniform Crime Reports. Directs the Administrator of the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration to: (1) conduct a research program for the development of techniques and equipment for use by State and local fire fighting and law enforcement personnel for arson prediction, prevention, and control; (2) establish anti-arson educational and training programs for State and local government; (3) develop materials for community awareness programs; and (4) provide information relative to the prevention, prediction, occurrence, and control of arson. Amends the Urban Property Protection and Reinsurance Act of 1968 to provide that fair access to insurance requirements plans shall require policies to be issued only after insurers obtain information from a prospective policyholder with respect to arson."
