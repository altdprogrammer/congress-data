Denies such credit to taxpayers whose gross receipts were in excess of $250,000,000 for a taxable year, or whose research and experimental expenditures did not exceed 2.5 percent of the gross receipts for a taxable year. Extends the investment tax credit to buildings and structural components used in research and experimentation. Requires the recapture of credit amounts if investment property ceases to be used for research and experimental purposes. Allows the amortization of research and experimental property, based on a period of not less than 60 months."
