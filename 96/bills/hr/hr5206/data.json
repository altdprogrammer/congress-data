Stipulates that the Administration of the Environmental Protection Agency may not control or prohibit the sale of any fuel, class of fuels, or fuel additive if the Administrator determines that: (1) such product will be predominantly used in an area in which the reduction of motor vehicle emissions is not necessary in order to meet national ambient air quality standards; and (2) the use of such a product will not significantly impair the performance of any emission control device in the motor vehicle in which the product will be used."
