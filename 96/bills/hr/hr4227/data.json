    "text": "Agricultural Land Protection Act - Title I: Federal Agency Compliance - Requires the interpretation and administration of the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States in accordance with a recognition of the rights and responsibilities of private landholders in making land use decisions, and the rights and responsibilities of State and local governments in developing public policies regarding non-Federal land use. Directs Federal agencies to consider the retention of agricultural land for agricultural purposes when they make decisions which impact directly or indirectly on private and State and local government public land, as well as on Federal land. Requires all such Federal agencies to review their administrative procedures, especially those regarding land acquisition and management, in order to bring them into conformity with the policies and purposes of this Title. Title II: Study of Protection of Agricultural Land - Amends the Rural Development Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture in coordination and cooperation with colleges and universities to conduct a study of: (1) agricultural land in the United States; (2) the effects of industrial development, climate and other factors on the productivity of such land; (3) the effects of Federal, State, and local government policies, laws, and regulations on the use of such land; (4) the acquisition of such land by persons not engaged in agricultural activities; (5) methods of protecting and improving such land, and of reducing the amount of it being converted to nonagricultural uses; and (6) ways of reaffirming and protecting the principles of individual property ownership and property rights in agricultural land in the policies, programs, and actions of governments at all levels. Requires a preliminary report within two years after enactment, and a final report to the President and Congress within four years after the preliminary report. Authorizes the Secretary to establish an Agricultural Land Protection Advisory Committee to consult with him concerning such study. Requires the study to emphasize the analysis of already existing data. Requires that any agricultural land protection technical assistance to the States consist of services other than direct financial assistance. Establishes an Agricultural Land Protection Information Clearinghouse Network. Title III: Technical Assistance Program - Directs the Secretary, acting through the Soil Conservation Service, to provide States and local governments with technical assistance concerning methods of protecting agricultural land and reducing the quantity of such land being converted from agricultural to nonagricultural uses. Title IV: General Provisions - Defines terms used in this Act."
