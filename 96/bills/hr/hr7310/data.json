    "text": "Export Trading Company Act of 1980 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Promotion, to promote export trading companies and facilitate contacts between producers of exportable goods and export trading companies. Authorizes any banking organization to invest up to specified amounts in export trading companies without obtaining the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency. Allows greater investment by Edge Act corporations not engaged in banking. Permits any banking organization to invest beyond such limitations after: (1) filing an application to make such investments with the appropriate Federal banking agency; and (2) proposed investment is not denied by such agency. Provides for judicial review of denial orders in the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals. Sets forth the grounds for disapproval. Prohibits those banking organizations, and their affiliates, with an ownership interest in any export trading company from extending credit to such companies or customers of such companies on more favorable terms than those afforded to similar borrowers. Authorizes the Export-Import Bank of the United States to provide loans and guarantees to export trading companies for the financing of exports and export trade services in specified circumstances. Limits the amount of loans and guarantees to any one company and in the aggregate. Declares that such authority shall expire five years from enactment. Authorizes the Bank to provide loan guarantees to such companies or exporters to be secured by accounts receivable or inventories in specified circumstances. Permits State and local governments to participate in export trading companies. Declares that such companies shall be eligible for the Export-Import Bank's loans and guarantees under this Act. Amends the Webb-Pomerene Act to exempt export trading companies solely with respect to their export trade activities from antitrust restrictions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to make banking organizations which have invested in an export trading company eligible for treatment as domestic international sales corporations (DISC). Includes the gross receipts from the export of services produced in the United States and from export trade services as qualified export receipts, in the case of a DISC which is an export trading company. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, with the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and distribute information concerning the utilization of the DISC provisions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to make export trading companies eligible for Subchapter S treatment if the shareholders of such companies are otherwise small business corporations. Exempts such companies from restrictions on the amount of foreign income they can receive and still be eligible for Subchapter S tax treatment."
