    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-07-27", 
    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1970 to require all exporters of certain wheat, feed grains, and cotton products to make daily (currently, weekly) reports to the Secretary of Agriculture of specified kinds of information regarding any export sale, or agreement to sell for export, of any such product. Requires the identification of the buyer, and the buyer's relationship, if any, to the exporter, in such reports. Changes the current penalties for a knowing failure to make such reports to a maximum $25,000 civil penalty for failure to report, whether knowing or not. Sets the formula for calculation of such penalty at five cents per bushel multiplied by the number of bushels not timely reported for each violation. Makes each day of any such failure a separate violation of such Act. Prescribes procedures for the assessment, review, and collection of such penalties. Grants the Secretary a right of access to all books and records and any documentary evidence of any person subject to these reporting requirements."
