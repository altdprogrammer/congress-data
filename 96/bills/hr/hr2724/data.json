    "text": "Social Services Amendments of 1979 - Amends title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act to increase the total amount allocable to the States for social services. Requires State officials to consult with local officials in developing a comprehensive services program plan. Stipulates that of the total annual amount payable to the State under title XX, $200,000,000 shall be exclusively for the provision of child day care services. Specifies that sums granted by a State to a \"qualified provider of child day care services\" to assist such provider in meeting its \"Federal welfare recipient employment incentive expenses\" or its \"Federal work incentive program expenses\" with respect to individuals employed in jobs related to providing child day care services in the facilities of such provider shall, for the purposes of title XX, constitute expenses made by the State for the provision of child day care centers. Makes permanent the provisions of title XX relating to the special authorization of funds for: (1) child day care services; and (2) medical care associated with the initial detoxification of alcoholics and drug addicts. Authorizes payment for emergency shelter for adults in danger of physical or mental injury, neglect, maltreatment or exploitation. Prohibits payment for such shelter for more than 30 days in any six month period. Authorizes appropriations under title XX for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands for specified social service programs for fiscal year 1980 and succeeding years. Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to increase the limitation on the authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1980 and thereafter for Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands with respect to specified public assistance programs."
