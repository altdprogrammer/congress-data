Directs the Administrator to approve a State implementation plan revision which establishes less stringent emission limitations applicable to an existing source in an attainment or nonattainment area and which, in the case of a nonattainment area, demonstrate reasonable further progress toward attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards, if the Governor of such State proposes such revision because the requirements of such Act threaten shutdown of such source. Declares that such revision will be deemed approved if the Administrator has not acted on the proposed revision within 90 days of receipt."
