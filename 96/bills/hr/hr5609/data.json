    "text": "Long-Term Care Residents' Rights Act - Declares as the policy of the United States that each resident in a long-term care facility has specified basic rights, such as the right to participate in decision-making regarding his or her medical treatment to the maximum extent possible, and the right to confidential treatment of personal and medical records. Requires that each long-term care facility which participates in a health care program, receives Federal assistance, or is certified for participation in a Federal or State health care financing program secure to each resident such basic rights by meeting specified obligations, including the following: (1) establishing written policies regarding residents' rights and procedures for implementing such policies; (2) informing residents of their rights and of any changes in the policies and procedures of the facility at least 30 days before any such change becomes effective; (3) informing residents of the services and charges of the facility; (4) giving 30-day notice to a resident who is to be involuntarily transferred or discharged from the facility; (5) assisting each resident to exercise his or her rights as a resident and citizen, including filing complaints and voicing grievances; (6) protecting each resident from mental and physical abuse; and (7) permitting residents who are husband and wife to share the same room if they so choose. Prohibits any such facility from: (1) denying admission to or terminating the stay of any resident because of the source of third-party payment; or (2) interfering with the right of any resident to receive primary health care services from sources other than the facility. Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to require the long-term care ombudsman program to investigate and resolve complaints made by or on behalf of a resident of a long-term care facility regarding alleged violations of rights secured by this Act. Grants to any individual whose rights under this Act have been violated a cause of action against the facility for damages and other relief in a United States district court without regard to the amount in controversy or exhaustion of remedies. Stipulates that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any facility: (1) for the mentally ill; (2) owned and operated by the Federal Government or; (3) affiliated with a correctional institution."
