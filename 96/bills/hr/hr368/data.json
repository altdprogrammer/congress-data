Title II: Searches and Seizures Involving the Media and Individuals - Provides penalties for seeking evidence of a crime, under color of law and not incident to a lawful arrest, without first obtaining a subpoena. Permits a court to issue a search warrant if it finds at a hearing that there is probable cause that the person in control of the evidence has committed or is committing the crime to which the evidence relates or that the evidence sought would be destroyed, concealed, or altered. Stipulates that the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding. Authorizes aggrieved individuals to commence civil actions in U.S. district courts. Permits States to enact laws giving increased protection to the gathering or dissemination of news."
