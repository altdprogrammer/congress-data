Requires each agency, upon the request of the Administrator, to supply the Office with: (1) information concerning the current and future audiovisual production activities of the agency; and (2) an evaluation of the success or failure of each completed activity. Requires that each employee under a contract to produce Federal audiovisual materials receive compensation at rates not less than those prevailing for similar employees as determined by the Secretary of Labor. Directs all Federal audiovisual supervisory authorities to report to the Administrator on their activities within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
