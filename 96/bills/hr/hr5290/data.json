Defines hazardous substance as: (1) any hazardous substance so designated by the Clean Water Act; (2) any hazardous waste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act; (3) any toxic pollutant listed under the Clean Water Act; (4) any hazardous air pollutant listed under the Clean Air Act; (5) any imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture as defined by the Toxic Substances Control Act; (6) any substance or mixture designated as a hazardous substance by the President pursuant to this Act; or (7) any element, substance, compound, or mixture which after release into the environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation or assimilation into any organism, directly or indirectly, will or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death, physical or behavioral malfunction or disease. Directs the President to promulgate and revise regulations designating as hazardous substances, in addition to those defined above, such elements and compounds which, if released in a determined quantity into the environment, may present substantial danger to the public health or environment. Prohibits the discharge of any hazardous substance in violation of the Clean Water Act or the release or disposal of such substances which may affect the natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management authority of the United States. Directs any person in charge of any vessel or onshore or offshore facility which is discharging, releasing, or disposing of a hazarous substance to immediately notify the appropriate agency of the United States Government of such discharge, release, or disposal. Establishes criminal penalties for failing to provide such notice. Requires any person subject to liability for a noncomplying waste disposal site to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) within a specified period of: (1) the existence of such site; (2) the amount and type of hazardous substances to be found at such site; and (3) the likelihood of discharge or release of such substances from such site. Establishes criminal penalties for failing to provide such notice. Precludes such persons from any limitation or defense of liability to which they would otherwise be entitled. Prohibits such persons from knowingly rendering unavailable or unreadable any record relating to the to the site or any hazardous substances contained or deposited therein.

Authorizes the President to take any emergency response measure including removal or containment, necessary to protect the public health or the environment whenever a hazardous substance is discharged or released into the environment, unless it is determined that the owner or operator of the source of the release will properly remove such substance. Directs the President, within a specified period, to revise and republish the National Contingency Plan for the removal of oil and hazardous substances to reflect and effectuate the responsibilities and powers created by this Act. Specifies that such revision include a National Hazardous Substance Disposal Site Response Plan, such plan to include: (1) methods for discovering and investigating such sites; (2) methods for evaluating and containing any actual or threatened discharges or releases from such sites which pose a substantial danger to the public health or the environment; (3) methods and criteria for determining the appropriate extent of emergency response, containment, and other measures authorized by this Act; (4) appropriate roles and responsbilities for various governmental and nongovernmental entities in effectuating the Plan; (5) provision for response equipment and supplies; and (6) provision for reporting the existence of and any releases of hazardous substances from sites which may be located on federally-owned or controlled properties. Authorizes the Administrator to require any person involved in activities which may present a danger to public health or the environment related to the handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any hazardous substance to take any necessary actions to ascertain the nature and extent of such danger, or to bring suit in the appropriate United States district court to require any such person to take such actions. Makes the owner or operator of a vessel or an onshore or offshore facility from which a hazardous substance is discharged jointly and severally liable for specified damages resulting from such discharge, with specified exceptions. Authorizes the President or the authorized representative of a State to act on behalf of the public as trustee of any natural resources damaged or lost as a result of such discharge and to recover for such damages. Stipulates that each department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government shall be subject to and comply with this Act. Imposes liability upon any generator or transporter of any hazardous substance for such discharge by the facility which was the source of the discharge if such generator or transporter could have reasonably anticipated such discharge. Imposes punitive damages upon the owner or operator of a hazardous substance disposal site for failure to properly provide emergency response or containment upon request of the President. Establishes in the United States Treasury a Hazardous Substance Response Fund to be constituted from specified fees, and all moneys recovered on behalf of the Fund or recovered or collected under the Clean Water Act. Requires manufacturers, importers, and generators of hazardous substances to pay fees on each unit of hazardous substance produced, manufactured, or imported into the United States and each unit of hazardous waste generated. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate rules and regulations relating to the collection of such fees, and sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violation of such regulations. Authorizes the Secretary to invest any excess of the Fund in interest- bearing special obligations of the United States. Directs the President to issue notes or other obligations to the Secretary in the event the moneys available in the fund are inadequate to meet the obligations of the fund. Directs the Administrator of EPA, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and the Comptroller General to conduct a study of possible incentives to safer operation of vessels and facilities to reduce the potential of discharges or releases of hazardous substances, and of measures to prevent or avoid the occurrence of such discharges. Sets forth the purposes for which Fund moneys may be used. Authorizes the President to delegate his duties under this Act to the heads of appropriate Federal agencies, departments, and instrumentalities. Directs the President to establish a national priority system for responding to releases of hazardous substances and a system whereby States affected by such discharges may act to provide emergency response and be reimbursed for reasonable costs incurred thereof.

Sets forth procedures for the disposition of claims resulting from such discharges. Establishes a six year statute of limitation for claims presented or actions commenced under this Act. Subrogates to the United States Government all rights of a claimant to recover the costs of removal or damages from the person responsible for a hazardous substance discharge prior to payment of any claim by the Fund. Subrogates any person, including the Fund, who pays compensation pursuant to this Act to any claimant for damages or removal costs, to all rights, claims, and causes of action for such damages and removal costs of such claimant. Directs the Attorney General, upon request of the President, to commence on action on behalf of the Fund to recover any compensation paid by the Fund to any claimant pursuant to this Act. Directs the President, acting through the Administrators of the EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, to issue regulations for the assessment of damages for injury to or loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge of hazardous substances. Directs the Comptroller General to provide for auditing of all payments and other uses of the Fund. Requires owners and operators of vessels carrying hazardous substances and of onshore and offshore facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in an amount consistent with the risks associated with the transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous substances.
