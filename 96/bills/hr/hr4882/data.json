    "text": "Regulatory Reduction and Congressional Control Act - Requires each Federal agency upon publication of each proposed and final rule to prepare, publish, and submit to Congress and the Comptroller General: (1) a statement of the need of the rule; and (2) a preliminary analysis of the economic impact of the rule. Requires, with respect to proposed major and final rules, as such rules are defined in this Act: (1) an economic impact statement disclosing the costs and benefits expected to result from the rule; (2) estimates of the paperwork requirements imposed by the rule; (3) estimates of the effects of the rule on the operation, workload, and efficiency of the Federal courts; and (4) an index of all other rules pertaining to the same subject matter. Makes it the responsibility of the Administrator of General Services to enforce prompt publication of such material. Authorizes the appropriate committees of Congress to review any such rule to determine whether it is economical and consistent with existing law and congressional intent. States that any such rule shall not become effective if it is disapproved within 60 days by one House of Congress and no action is taken on the disapproval resolution by the other House. Provides that either House of Congress may, by resolution, require any agency to reconsider and resubmit any rule to which this Act applies. Requires that such proposed rule be repromulgated anew in accordance with all the provisions of this Act unless it is reconsidered and resubmitted to Congress within 210 days after the adoption of the resolution requiring such reconsideration. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) determine whether benefits of each rule exceed the costs; (2) determine the accuracy of each economic impact statement; (3) report its findings to Congress; and (4) develop, in conjunction with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the methods of preparing the preliminary analysis and economic impact statement. Requires each agency to transmit to Congress an annual report of the total costs of the public of complying with that agency's rules."
