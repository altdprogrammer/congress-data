Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to admit free of duty (or refund duty already paid) 47 carillon bells and all accompanying parts and accessories for the use of Wake Forest University. Suspends the duty on certain cobalt alloys and manganese ore until June 30, 1982. Provides for the reimbursement, upon request, of any duty paid on manganese ore between June 30, 1979, and the date of enactment of this Act. Extends the duty-free entry of bicycle lighting sets and parts until June 30, 1983. Revises the list of parts eligible for duty-free entry. Establishes a duty on models of household furnishings, building parts of houses, and kits for constructing such items. Revises the definition of rubber for purposes of such schedules to include substances which cannot meet specified tests after the addition of fillers, extenders, pigments, or chemicals. Amends the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 to make technical corrections in the tariff treatment of watches. Stipulates that the ad valorem duties imposed on iron and steel products are in addition to specified rates of duty. Increases the ad valorem rate of duty on specified forms of spiegeleisen. Exempts flight simulating machines, balloons, gliders, and airplanes from the duty-free treatment proclaimed for articles certified for use in civil aircraft."
