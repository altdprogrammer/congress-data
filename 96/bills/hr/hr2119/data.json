Modifies the scope of the provision barring certain activity by Government employees on behalf of other persons within a two-year period after their Government employment ends, to eliminate the express application of such provision to executive schedule and certain other high-ranking Government officials who knowingly aid, counsel, advise, consult, or assist in representing such persons."
