    "text": "National Library Resources Sharing Act of 1980 - Amends the Library Services and Construction Act to permit grants to States under such Act to be used (along with other permissible uses) to make funds available to State library administrative agencies to develop long-range plans for library services of all types. Requires that 15 percent of amounts appropriated under such Act be made available for direct grants to existing regional and national cooperative networks of libraries. Requires that applications for such grants be approved by the Assistant Secretary for Library and Information Services, with the endorsement of at least one State library agency. Declares that nothing contained in the Communication Act of 1934 or in any other law shall be construed to prevent U. S. communications common carriers from rendering, subject to Federal Communications Commission regulation, free or reduced rate communications interconnection services for interconnection systems for nonprofit library and educational activities. Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to establish in the Department of Education: (1) a position of Assistant Secretary for Library and Information Services; and (2) an Office of Library and Information Services, to be administered by such Assistant Secretary. Directs the Secretary of Education to delegate to such Assistant Secretary all functions administered before the effective date of this Act by the Office of Libraries and Learning Resources of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and other appropriate functions."
