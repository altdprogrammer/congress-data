    "text": "Requires that anyone who has been convicted of burglary, aggravated assault, rape, robbery, second degree murder within the special jurisdiction of the United States, or bank robbery and: (1) has previously been convicted of such offenses; or (2) has previously been convicted in a State court of second degree murder, rape, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, any offense involving a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon, or certain narcotics offenses shall, in addition to any sentence imposed for such offense, be sentenced to a term of ten years imprisonment. Requires that such repeat offender shall not be sentenced to less than the mandatory minimum sentence for such subsequent offense. Stipulates that the imposition of any term of imprisonment under this section: (1) may not be suspended; (2) may not run concurrently; and (3) may not include probation or parole. Stipulates that the Federal Youth Corrections Act shall not apply to any imprisonment under this Act. Prohibits a defendant from pleading guilty to a lesser offense that would result in making this Act inapplicable."
