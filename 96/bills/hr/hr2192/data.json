Defines an \"eligible water system\" to mean any water system which is publicly owned and which serves 60,000 or fewer individuals. Permits the Administrator to make such grants only if such grant: (1) is necessary to enable an eligible water system to meet a national primary drinking water standard; (2) takes into account such areawide and regional planning for the provision of drinking water as the Administrator deems appropriate; (3) conforms to all applicable State and local laws; and (4) is designed to meet the present, and reasonably anticipated, needs to be served by the system. Authorizes grants for up to 75 percent of the total cost of purchase, construction, or modification of any facility."
