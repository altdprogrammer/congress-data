    "text": "Federal Artists Program Act of 1979 - Amends the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 to establish a \"Federal Artists Program\" of Federal assistance to individual artists for employment in community-oriented and locally supported projects. Defines \"artist\" as an individual of demonstrated artistic ability who: (1) has completed a bachelor's degree or its equivalent in a recognized professional training program and has at least two years of professional work experience as an artist or has at least four years of professional work experience as an artist; and (2) has received more than 20 percent of individual income from employment as an artist during any two calendar years occurring during the most recent four calendar years. Authorizes the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, any designated arts agency to establish programs to place artists with local sponsoring organizations to undertake artistic endeavors: (1) as a component of services provided by such organization; and (2) which serve the public by providing access to art experiences and enriching the environment and the quality of life. Bases eligibility as a designated arts agency on a public agency's or a private nonprofit organization's: (1) designation by any State or local government, or combinations thereof, as their official arts agency; and (2) experience in directly supporting the arts and artists through a grants program or advocacy on their behalf. Requires the applications for assistance of such agencies to include a comprehensive program plan with specified features. Directs the Chairman to: (1) establish criteria (with specified inclusions) and procedures for evaluating and selecting such applications; (2) seek recommendations from a panel of experts representing a diversity of geographic areas and cultural backgrounds before approving such applications; and (3) coordinate the administration of the Federal Artists Program with specified Federal, State, local and private programs. Sets a three year limit on assistance to any sponsoring organization based on a declining percentage of the salaries such organization pays artists. Sets forth requirements for the sponsoring organization relating to working conditions and use of funds. Limits to ten percent the amount of such funds which may be used for administrative expenses by a designated arts agency. Allows designated arts agencies to submit another application for grants or contracts upon the mandatory three year expiration of a grant or contract. Limits the amount of salary and the duration of employment (three years maximum) of any one artist under such program. Requires each designated arts agency receiving assistance for any fiscal year to submit a program report, with specified inclusions, to the Chairman. Directs the Chairman to review programs at least annually. Stipulates that the copyright of any work produced by an artist in such program shall be retained exclusively by the artist and that the artist shall own all such original work. Grants the sponsoring organization and the designated arts agency involved a royalty-free nonexclusive right to use or display such art work for a period not to exceed five years from the completion of the project. Applies all financial assistance procedures and other provisions relating to the National Endowment for the Arts to the Federal Artists Program. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 through 1985 for such program."
