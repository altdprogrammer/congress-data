    "text": "Regulation Reform Act of 1980 - Sets forth a payment schedule for project water which must be included in any water service contract or repayment contract entered into by the Secretary of the Interior with a district after enactment of this Act. Declares that any water service or repayment contract in effect before the enactment of this Act shall be amended to include such schedule at the request of the district affected. Exempts the owners or operators of farms within a district for which there is in effect a water service or repayment contract containing such schedule from the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law. Declares that any recordable contract concerning a farm within a district which has amended a water service or repayment contract to include such schedule shall, at the landowner's request, be amended to permit the landowner to retain not more than 960 acres of land receiving project water. Directs the Secretary, at least once every five years, to recalculate the cost of delivering project water to a district and to modify the price of water under water service or repayment contracts accordingly. Entitles any farm within a district which has in effect a water service or repayment contract containing such schedule to delivery of a minimum amount of project water per year. Specifies the formula for determining such minimum amount for each farm. Provides for curtailments in deliveries of project water whenever there is not enough water within a district to meet water delivery requests. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. States that the costs of carrying out this Act with respect to a particular project or district shall be reimbursable."
