Directs the court, in determining the justification for any such award, to consider whether the plaintiff or defendant: (1) made motions or asserted claims or defense lacking in merit intentionally for delay; (2) violated any applicable rule, statute, or court order providing sanctions for dilatory behavior; or (3) engaged in conduct primarily for delaying the litigation or increasing the costs thereof. Directs the court to consider whether the award of such interest is necessary to compensate the plaintiff for injuries sustained by such plaintiff. Specifies that such factors shall be the court's exclusive criteria in determining whether prejudgment interest shall be awarded."
