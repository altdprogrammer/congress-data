Rept. 96-905) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for the United States International Trade Commission. Prohibits the use of such funds for making studies at the request of any executive branch agency, unless such agency reimburses the Commission. Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 for the United States Customs Service.

Authorizes additional appropriations as necessary for pay rate changes. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to increase the maximum charge for overtime services performed for private aircraft or vessels arriving in or departing the United States during fiscal year 1981. Provides for fees which sufficiently reimburse the United States for providing such services after September 30, 1981. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the U.S. Trade Representative to delegate or redelegate any functions, powers and duties. Increases the powers of the Trade Representative to authorize the payment of official travel expenses, the acceptance of gifts, and the acquisition of motor vehicles for use abroad. Authorizes appropriations for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for fiscal year 1981 with a specified limitation on the amount for entertainment and representation expenses. Authorizes additional appropriations as necessary for pay rate changes. Repeals provisions abolishing the Office of Special Representative for Trade Negotiations. Changes references to the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations to references to the U.S. Trade Representative."
