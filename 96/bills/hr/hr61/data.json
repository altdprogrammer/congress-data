Requires notices of proposed rulemaking to be published in appropriate publications in addition to the Federal Register whenever such publication would substantially improve notification to those parties significantly affected by the proposed rule. Requires such notice to include an estimate of the projected paperwork burden involved in complying with the proposed rule. States that the drafting stage of the rule shall not be less than 30 days in duration. Increases from 30 days to 45 days the length of time which must lapse between the publication of a substantive rule and its effective date."
