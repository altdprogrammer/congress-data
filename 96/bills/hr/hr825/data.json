    "text": "Requires charitable organizations which solicit, by any means, the remittance of a contribution by mail to include with such solicitation: (1) the legal name and principal address of the organization; (2) the purpose of the solicitation and intended use of the contribution; (3) the obligation of the organization to furnish the information required by this Act; (4) the percentage of all such contributions directly applied to charitable purposes, after deducting total administrative costs, during the most recent complete fiscal year, or in some cases the fiscal year preceding such fiscal year; and (5) the period of time such organization has operated. Directs that all of the above information be transmitted, whether in writing or by radio or television, conspicuously in a non-technical, readily understandable manner. Exempts broadcast solicitations of specified brevity from these requirements. Requires that such organizations furnish, upon request, such audit reports, accounts, or other information as the Postal Service may require to establish or verify the information included in the solicitations. Requires such organizations to furnish, within 30 days to anyone who has been solicited and so requests, pertinent financial information reasonably sufficient to verify any information included in the solicitation. Sets forth the method by which such organizations with outside income may distribute administrative costs. Exempts from these requirements: (1) membership organizations when soliciting their own members; (2) schools, colleges, and universities when soliciting their students, alumni, faculty, governing boards, committees, or family members of such individuals; (3) health care facilities when soliciting their personnel, board of trustees, committees, or family members of such individuals; and (4) charitable organizations authorized by and exclusively making expenditures to a school, college, university or health care facility from such individuals. Prohibits the Postal Service from prescribing any rules to carry out this Act."
