Stipulates that such securities shall be available only to Postal Service employees for the first 180 days of sale. Requires full payment to the United States of the fair market value of such property within 30 years after completion of such transfer. Directs the President to submit to Congress: (1) a comprehensive plan for such transfer; and (2) recommendations for legislation necessary to carry out such plan including recommendations for the abolishment of the Postal Service."
