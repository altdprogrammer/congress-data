Sets forth the considerations to be included in such evaluation, including potential economic losses, impact on the social well-being of the people, and enhancement of local economic activity. Requires the Water Resources Council to study and report to Congress regarding other factors that should be considered. Amends the provision authorizing the Secretary of the Army to receive contributions from States and their political subdivisions for authorized flood control projects to provide interested non-federal parties the opportunity to contribute the amount of costs which exceed the benefits of the project as determined by the Secretary."
