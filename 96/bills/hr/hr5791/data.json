    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Native Hawaiians Study Commission Act - Establishes the Native Hawaiians Study Commission to be composed of 15 members appointed by the President and to include one member from each of the following islands in the State of Hawaii: Hawaii, Molokai, Oahu Kauai, Maui, and Lanai. Sets forth operating procedures for such Commission. Declares that such Commission shall terminate upon the filing of its final report. Directs the Commission to: (1) conduct a thorough investigation of the events which led to the abdication of the indigenous government of Hawaii and its subsequent annexation by the United States; (2) assess and evaluate the economic and social needs of Native Hawaiians; and (3) conduct hearings on specified islands and other areas of the United States having a significant number of Native Hawaiians. Requires the Commission to publish a draft report of its findings within one year after its first meeting and to distribute copies to appropriate Federal and State agencies, Native Hawaiian organizations, and, upon request, to members of the public. Directs the Commission to issue a final report within nine months after publication of its draft report and to submit such final report to the President and appropriate Congressional committees. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as: (1) constituting a jurisdictional act; (2) conferring or implying consent to sue the United States with respect to claims arising from actions which took place in Hawaii in 1893; or (3) reopening any past settlement involving land claims with any American Indian organization."
