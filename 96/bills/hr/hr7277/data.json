    "text": "Child Nutrition Amendments of 1980 - Amends the National School Lunch Act to require a State to administer the summer food service program for children and the child care food program as a condition to receiving cash assistance payments for the school lunch program. Reduces the national average payment for lunches served to children ineligible for free or reduced-price lunches unless such lunches served represent 50 percent or less of all lunches served under such program. Requires annual rather than semi-annual adjustments in the amount of special assistance payments to the State agencies. Modifies the income guidelines for eligibility for reduced-price lunches. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a pilot test to verify data on applications for free or reduced-price school meals. Directs the Secretary to allow a standard deduction of $60 a month for each household in computing household income in all but specified States. Requires the annual adjustment of such deduction to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for items other than food. Sets forth a formula for determining the standard deduction for noncontiguous States and jurisdictions. Redefines \"service institutions\" for the purposes of the summer food service program for children to include private nonprofit institutions that serve meals primarily to migrant children. Directs each State to conduct active outreach efforts to identify eligible institutions to participate in such program in areas with large concentrations of low-income families. Permits any service institution to serve lunch and either breakfast or a supplement (rather than three meals, including a supplement) each day of operation. Permits any service institution which is a camp or which serves meals primarily to migrant children to serve up to four meals per day of operation. Authorizes service institutions to use a preapproved portion of the available reimbursement for the operating and administrative expenses of such program, as specified. Directs the Secretary to make available to States administering such program an amount of up to two percent of the funds expended by such State for such purpose. Sets forth a formula for determining payments to each State for administrative costs. Sets forth the recordkeeping requirements for States and service institutions participating in such program. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose through fiscal year 1983. Directs the Secretary to adjust annually rather than semiannually the national average payment rate to the States for the child care food program. Reduces the amount available to the Secretary to provide equipment assistance to enable institutions to establish, maintain, and expand the child care food program. Permits the Secretary to establish special procedures for the conduct of audits of participating institutions. Authorizes the Secretary to require each State to establish a standard form of contract for use by institutions in purchasing meals. Requires each State agency that distributes commodities and other foods to schools under the commodity distribution program to establish procedures to permit a school to receive the desired amounts and types of commodity assistance, including the delivery of alternative commodities when available. Requires each State to be responsible for the administration of the programs under the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold funds from or seek injunctive relief against a State which does not take sufficient action to correct deficiencies in such programs. Amends the Child Nutrition of 1966 to establish the rate of reimbursement per half-pint of milk served to children not eligible for free milk under the special milk program at five cents. Requires annual rather than semi-annual adjustments to be made in the national average payment under the school breakfast program. Extends the authorization for the food service equipment assistance program through fiscal year 1983. Directs the Secretary to allocate funds for State administrative expenses to the agencies responsible for the administration of the programs authorized under the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, excepting the special supplemental food program. Permits the States to use the allocated funds as needed in meeting the administrative costs of such programs. Directs the Secretary to reallocate any unused funds. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the special supplemental food program. Prohibits the dual receipt of benefits under such program and the commodity supplemental food program authorized under the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977. Extends the authorization of appropriations for nutrition education and training through fiscal year 1983. Reduces the number of members on the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition form 19 to 18. Sets forth the required credentials for specified members of such council. Requires the Council to submit to the President and to Congress a biennial rather than an annual report. Excludes Job Corps Centers from the definition of school for the purposes of the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act. Permits the Secretary to make adjustments for the differences in food program costs for participating States and territories not a part of the continental United States. Requires claims for reimbursement for meals served under the National School Lunch Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to be submitted to the State agency within a specified period of time. Authorizes appropriations for the commodity distribution program through fiscal year 1983. Grants the Secretary the power to determine the amount of and settle and adjust any claim arising under the provisions of such Acts. Directs the Secretary to give special emphasis to high protein foods when providing commodity assistance. Limits Federal reimbursement to the combined operating costs for both the lunch and breakfast programs. Modifies the formula for determining the amount of special assistance payments."
