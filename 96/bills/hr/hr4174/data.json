    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1979-05-22", 
    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to order the suspension of operations at each licensed nuclear powerplant having a similar design to any nuclear powerplant from which there has been an abnormal release of radiation or other accident involving radioactive material caused by design or mechanical flaws and endangering public health and safety. States that such suspension order shall remain effective until the Commission determines that the flaw has been corrected or that termination of suspension is otherwise in the public interest. Makes the license revocation and civil penalty provisions of such Act applicable to failures to comply with such orders. Directs the Commission to designate inspection regions in areas in the United States in which are located operating nuclear powerplants, and requires the placement of qualified inspectors in each such powerplant on a 24 hour basis. Directs the Commission to establish emergency teams of qualified personnel which shall have legal authority to supervise all activities involving any abnormal release of radiation or other accident at a licensed nuclear powerplant. Directs such team to inform the public on any such radiation emission and on any necessary evacuation plans. Directs the Commission to train, employ, and place nuclear engineers, technicians, and other personnel as may be necessary to operate nuclear powerplants licensed under such Act and requires that such powerplants be in fact operated by such personnel. Directs the Commission to establish a secure and direct communications system with such personnel. Requires that the Commission establish standards for such personnel, including training qualifications. Requires that States in which nuclear powerplants are located submit for the Commission's approval nuclear powerplant emergency plans and prohibits the issuance or renewal of any construction or operation license for any powerplant located in a State which has not submitted and obtained approval of such plan. Denies eligibility for Federal assistance for disaster relief to any State failing to submit such plan for approval. Requires the Commission to conduct continuous radiation monitoring of the environment surrounding licensed nuclear powerplants. Directs the Commission to carry out an inspection and evaluation program concerning compliance with requirements relating to nuclear powerplant construction, using only Commission personnel. Directs the Commission to submit to the Congress a comprehensive plan for the safe disposal or storage of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials associated with licensed nuclear powerplants."
