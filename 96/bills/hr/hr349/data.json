    "text": "Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to revise the provisions concerning the disclosure of Federal records on individuals. Requires Federal agencies to make available to individuals the accessible records they requested and any similar or derivative versions of such records. Requires the agency to account to the individual for the actual uses and disclosures made of such record, including other recipients of such record. Exempts specified records from disclosure. Requires disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion of an exempted record. Permits agencies to establish special procedures for the disclosure of information which would adversely affect the health of any individual. Deletes the provision of such Act which prohibits access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. Revises the limitations on disclosure of records to permit disclosure: (1) to persons other than an officer or employee of the agency concerned if certified for routine use; (2) for collateral uses if specifically authorized by statute; or (3) to Members of Congress in specified circumstances. Revises the provisions on the collection and maintenance of information by Federal agencies to enable individuals to supply information in as informed and uncoerced a manner as is reasonably possible, including the collateral uses of the information, the procedures for verifying the information, and the title, address, and telephone number of a Federal official who can assist the individual. Prohibits the maintenance of inaccurate or irrelevant information, unless by a Federal agency which is primarily concerned with the enforcement of criminal laws. Requires reasonable safeguards to minimize the risk of substantial harm to the individual to whom the information pertains. Prohibits any Federal agency or employee from collecting or maintaining information concerning the publications, speeches, associations, or religion of an individual except in specified circumstances. Requires Federal agencies to notify sources and prior recipients of all corrections to or statements of disagreements with individually identifiable records. Directs Federal agencies to reconsider any determinations based on erroneous information after receipt of a correction or statement of disagreement. Requires each Federal agency to designate one official to oversee the agency's implementation of this Act. Limits the liability of the United States for violations of this Act to no more than $10,000 in excess of any special damages sustained by the individual. Subjects Federal contractors or grantees to the provisions of this Act except for specified records. Stipulates that requests for information, which could be processed under the provisions of this Act or the provisions requiring public information as to agency rules, orders, opinions, records, and proceedings, should be processed under this Act, but should not result in the individual receiving less information than would be received pursuant to the provisions of other laws."
