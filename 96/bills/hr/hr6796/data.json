    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1981 and 1982 to carry out title VII (private sector opportunities for the economically disadvantaged) programs. Revises the formulas for the allocation of funds under such title. Requires that ten percent of such funds be used by the Secretary of Labor to provide incentive bonuses to prime sponsors who promote coordination with economic development activities supported by Federal, State, or local funds. Prohibits taking funds used for such coordinated activities into account in the computation of cost per participant or cost per placement for purposes of program evaluation. Includes local economic development councils established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 among those entities: (1) to which a proposed plan for activities must be made available by those receiving title VII assistance; and (2) from which prime sponsors receiving such assistance must appoint members to a private industry council (or from similar local economic development councils). Specifies that appointments to such council should include persons with expertise in on-site, industry specific vocational education. Includes among the possible private sector initiative program activities of prime sponsors the development of on-site, industry specific training programs in cooperation with State vocational education boards, provided that, where feasible, funds made available under such Act for such programs are supplemented by Federal, State, or local vocational education funds and/or by nongovernment funds made specifically available for such programs. Includes among title VII program activities upgrading and retraining in accordance with specified provisions. Limits to 15 percent of the funds available for title VII the amount which may be used for upgrading and retraining. Requires participating employees to agree to hire one economically disadvantaged person for every employee participating in such upgrading or retraining program. Permits prime sponsors to establish programs to coordinate title VII activities with economic development programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Changes the base, under CETA, for calculating the average wage index from $7,200 to $8,000 per annum. Extends through fiscal year 1982 specified CETA provisions requiring the Secretary of Labor to use discretionary funds to make allocations among the prime sponsors serving areas within the standard metropolitan statistical areas and central cities for which current population surveys were used to determine annual unemployment data prior to January 1, 1978, in proportion to the extent to which such prime sponsors' formula allocations otherwise would be reduced by the termination of the use of such surveys. Makes technical corrections in such Act."
