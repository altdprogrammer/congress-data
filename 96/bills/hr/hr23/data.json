Requires the Secretary of Defense, in the Secretary's annual report to Congress on military manpower requirements, to include an assessment of the Nation's capabilities to mobilize such additional manpower as may be needed to meet national security requirements under emergency situations, including the feasibility of a program for three months of active duty assignment for selected persons, followed by a three-year reserve obligation. Amends the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 to transfer the personnel and funds of the Selective Service System to the Department of Defense. Stipulates that enlisted or appointed military personnel when released from active duty shall be transferred to a reserve component for three years, or as otherwise obligated by law, whichever is longer. Authorizes regulations to grant the Selective Service System access to age and address information in the records of any school, any agency of the United States, or any agency or political subdivision of any State for the sole purpose of conducting selective service registration."
