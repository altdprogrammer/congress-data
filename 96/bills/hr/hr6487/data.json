    "text": "Producer Referendum Act of 1980 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to establish in the Department of Agriculture a Board of Agricultural Producers to be composed of the Secretary of Agriculture and one member from each State selected by the Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service in such State. Directs the Board to: (1) make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to specified set-asides of cropland; (2) assist the Secretary in determining and improving cost of production formulas used to administer price support programs; and (3) advise the Secretary on other related matters. Declares that no cropland set-aside shall be effective unless such set-aside: (1) is limited to one crop year; (2) requires that any cropland set-aside be rotated no less than every two years; (3) does not prevent the use of cropland for production of crops for use in the production of fuel alcohol; and (4) has not been disapproved in a referendum by a majority of producers on U.S. farms whose principal source of income is derived from such crop. Directs the Secretary to conduct such referendum not later than 30 days after providing for the set-aside of any cropland used in the production of any agricultural commodity for any crop year under the Agricultural Act of 1949 or the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. Sets forth a civil penalty of $300 per acre for noncompliance with cropland set-asides."
