Stipulates that individuals so inducted shall be required to serve not less than 12 weeks of active duty for training. Stipulates that a random sequence drawing shall be conducted for induction for all registrants. Stipulates that effective upon the enactment of authority to induct persons into the armed forces no deferment will be granted to persons enlisting in any reserve component of the armed forces or the Ready Reserve of any such reserve component.
