Places dollar limitations on the amount of such credit for each of the three years. Defines \"payroll costs\" as direct labor costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer for the services of an employee in the United States at a manufacturing facility placed in use after March 1, 1980. Identifies as direct labor costs basic compensation, overtime, vacation and sick pay, and certain fringe benefits."
