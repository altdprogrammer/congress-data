    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of specified lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in Clark County, Nevada. Requires the Secretary and the affected local governmental jurisdictions to jointly develop regulations and select lands to be offered for sale. Sets forth the formula for allocating the revenues from such sales to the Treasury of the United States, the State of Nevada, the county or municipality within the boundaries of which such land sale occurred, and to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make annual payments to local governments within such areas for water pollution control, soil erosion mitigation, or acquisition of lands within the Lake Tahoe Basin. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, with the concurrence of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, to acquire specified unimproved, environmentally sensitive land to be administered as part of the United States National Forest System or, if unsuitable for administration as such, to be transferred to a unit of State or local government with specified restrictions. Permits the acquisition of specified portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin if such lands are being used, or a threat exists that they will be used, in a manner detrimental to the environmental quality of the Basin. Prohibits the acquisition of any detached single-family residential dwelling being used as such. Permits the owners of any improved property which contains a detached single family residential dwelling acquired by the Secretary to retain a right of use and occupancy for noncommercial residential purposes for a specified period. Requires the Secretary to pay to the owner the full market value of the rights acquired. Authorizes appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Authorizes additional appropriations in an amount equal to the amount of revenue obtained from the sale of federally-owned lands in Clark County, Nevada. Repeals the designation of the Mar-A-Lago National Historic Site, Palm Beach, Florida. Designates such site as the Mar-A-Lago National Historic Landmark. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer such property to the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation."
