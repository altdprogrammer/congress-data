Defines such fuel oil contribution as the fair market value of fuel oil: (1) the taxpayer has purchased but cannot use by reason of having converted the heating system for his residence to an energy source other than fuel oil; and (2) the taxpayer has consequently contributed to a tax-exempt charitable organization. Denies a charitable contribution deduction to any taxpayer who takes advantage of such credit."
