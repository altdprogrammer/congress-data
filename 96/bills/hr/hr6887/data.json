    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1980-03-20", 
    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to limit financial distress grants to any school of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, or public health in serious financial need (thus excluding currently eligible schools of veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, and podiatry). Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (formerly, Health, Education, and Welfare) to give special consideration to grant applications from such schools having significant enrollments of students from ethnic or racial minorities or from low-income families. Authorizes the Secretary to make such grants to meet, in addition to costs already provided for under such Act, costs of: (1) maintaining the quality of educational programs; and (2) strengthening academic resources and capabilities. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring changes in the educational component of the program of a recipient school. Limits the requirement of proper expenditure assurances to grant recipients (currently, all grant applicants must submit such assurances). Authorizes the Secretary to obligate grant funds in advance of appropriation. Requires proportionate reductions in obligated funds should appropriations fail to equal the projected amount. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1981 and for each of the four succeeding fiscal years. Eliminates the $5,000,000 ceiling on obligated or expended funds for start-up assistance grants for schools of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, and public health."
