    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to specify prohibited activities with respect to the administration or use of a polygraph examination on behalf of an employer engaged in business affecting interstate commerce. Forbids any such examination from including inquiries into: (1) any event occurring more than seven years before the examination date; (2) any information or belief relating to any matter involving religion, race, politics, or labor organizations; and (3) any matter relating to sexual behavior, unless such behavior is related to job performance. Prohibits a person from administering any such polygraph examination unless the individual taking the test: (1) is given a verbatim statement of each question to be asked; (2) consents in writing to participating in the examination; (3) is informed that no Federal law requires such participation; and (4) is provided an opportunity to explain any reaction indicating emotional stress occurring during the examination. Prohibits a person administering such an examination from: (1) refusing to provide the individual with a copy of any report or recommendation prepared for the employer on whose behalf the examination was administered; (2) disclosing the test results to anyone except the individual or employer or in certain types of investigations; and (3) intentionally preparing any misleading, biased, or falsified report or recommendation in connection with such examination."
