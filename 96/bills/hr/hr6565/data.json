    "text": "Alternative Education Act of 1980 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to establish Alternative Educational Programs. Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to make grants to local educational agencies for the Federal share of the costs of alternative educational programs designed to meet the needs of secondary school students who are: (1) deficient in basic skills in reading, mathematics, and oral and written communication; or (2) potential high school dropouts, or who might be diverted to facilities used by the juvenile justice system unless placed in alternative educational programs under the jurisdiction of local educational agencies. Prohibits funds for such programs from being used for programs which provide residential care for students. Authorizes the Commissioner to make similar grants to such agencies for training parents, teachers, and other educational personnel involved in such programs and to help them to identify learning disabilities and other problems that might lead to juvenile delinquency. Sets the Federal share of the costs of such programs at 90 percent for fiscal year 1981 and 80 percent for each of the two succeeding years. Sets forth application requirements, including specification of whether the program will be carried out by schools or by other nonprofit entities. Requires consultation and coordination to avoid duplication of services within the same geographic area. Directs the Commissioner to establish and operate a National Clearinghouse on Alternate Education to collect, analyze, and distribute upon request to local educational agencies and other interested parties information relating to such programs and to similar programs operated by other entities. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such programs for fiscal years 1981 through 1983."
