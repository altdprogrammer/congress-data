    "date": "1980-11-19", 
    "text": "Nondiscrimination in Insurance Act of 1979 - Prohibits any discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin regarding contracts for, or terms of, insurance policies. Permits insurers, who regularly provide insurance solely to persons of a single religious affiliation, to continue to do so. Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to administer and enforce this Act. Requires aggrieved persons to file such discrimination charges with State or local agencies in certain circumstances. Sets forth the procedures on charges filed with the Commission. Requires insurers to keep records and make reports as the Commission shall prescribe. Provides penalties for disclosure of information by employees of the Commission. Authorizes civil actions in U.S. district courts by the Commission if a conciliation agreement cannot be secured from the insurer. Allows an aggrieved person to institute a civil action against the insurer if the Commission has not instituted a civil action within certain time periods. Specifies the judicial relief available, if the court determines that the insurer has committed a discriminatory action."
