Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 through 1982 to carry out this title. =Title II: Financial Assistance Provided by the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank= - Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank Act - Establishes a Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide financial assistance to owners, purchasers, and tenants of commercial, residential, and agricultural structures for the purchase and installation of qualified solar energy systems and energy conservation improvements, and to nonprofit groups undertaking solar energy programs. Establishes the position of President of the Bank in HUD who shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Designates the Secretaries of HUD, Energy, and the Treasury as the Board of Directors of the Bank with the Secretary of HUD as Chairman. Authorizes the Bank to make payments to financial institutions and public utilities conducting loan programs under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to reduce the principal obligations on loans or to prepay the interest otherwise due. Directs the Board to establish various levels of such assistance from time to time, taking into account: (1) the prevailing market rates of interest for home mortgages, home improvement loans, agricultural loans, commercial loans, government and corporate bonds; (2) the availability of other federal incentives for solar energy and energy conservation measures, including tax credits; (3) the types and cost of nonrenewable energy resources that predominate in various areas of the country and the costs of systems using such resources; (4) the costs and efficiencies of qualified solar energy systems and energy conserving improvements; and (5) the levels of subsidy needed to induce owners from various income groups to purchase and install qualified solar energy systems and energy conserving improvements in residential, commercial, and agricultural buildings. Requires financial assistance to vary according to the estimated energy savings resulting from the use of a qualified solar system when assistance is provided to a purchaser of a newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated building containing such a system. States that in computing such energy savings, passive systems will be compared with other passive systems, and active systems to other active systems. Sets forth the maximum amount of such assistance, including the value of any Federal solar energy or conservation tax credit, which shall be provided to various types of structures. Establishes different ceilings on such assistance if the Board determines it is impracticable to vary the level of assistance according to estimated energy savings. Requires the level of assistance provided to an owner of any one-to-four-family residences for a solar energy system to vary according to: (1) the owner's income; (2) the cost of the system; and (3) the resulting energy savings to the extent it is practicable.

Requires the Bank to: (1) disseminate information developed by HUD and the Department of Energy regarding solar energy and conservation construction technology; (2) coordinate its programs with the secondary market activities of the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; (3) make relevant appraisal techniques available to appraisers; (4) provide technical assistance to nonprofit groups, low-income groups and local governments in formulating solar energy and conservation strategies; and (5) to provide other necessary technical assistance and information to promote the use of solar and energy conservation systems. Predicates such promotional activities on the availability of appropriations provided for such purposes. Directs the Board to submit an annual report on its activities and recommendations to the President and the Congress. Permits the Bank to use HUD staff members in carrying out its activities and to contract with other entities for such purposes. Establishes criminal penalties for false and misleading statements made with respect to loans assisted under this Act. Defines \"energy conserving improvements\" and \"qualified solar energy systems\" for the purposes of this Act. Excludes fireplaces, cogenerators, and photovoltaics from the qualified systems eligible for assistance. Authorizes the use of funds available in the Energy Security Trust Fund for: (1) qualified solar systems in fiscal years 1980 through 1983; (2) energy conserving improvements in fiscal years 1980 through 1983; and (3) promotional activities in fiscal years 1981 to 1983. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize the Secretary of HUD to fund contracts for financing solar energy systems in existing low-income housing projects not receiving assistance under the National Housing Act. Directs the Secretary to assure that such improvements are cost-effective and to place particular emphasis on projects with oil-fired furnaces. Requires newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated low-income projects to contain solar systems, unless the Secretary determines such a system would not be cost-effective. Permits the Secretary to insure loans for the purchase or installation of individual utility meters in multifamily housing projects if such meters are purchased or installed in connection with other energy conserving improvements or with a solar energy system or the project meets minimum standards of energy conservation established by the Secretary. =Title III: Secondary Financing= - Authorizes the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank to purchase loans and other advances of credit under this title unless its Board of Directors determines that such action is unnecessary to advance the national program of energy conservation in residential buildings. Authorizes the Bank to deal in loans and other advances of credit made by public utilities under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act for the financing of energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems in residential, commercial, and agricultural buildings.

Amends the charter of the FNMA to stipulate that the FNMA may deal in loans and other advances of credit for home improvements. =Title IV: Weatherization Program= - Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to prohibit more than ten percent of any program grant made under such Act from being used for administrative purposes. Reduces such limitation to five percent in the case of a grant made to a State. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to increase expenditures for labor in areas where there are insufficient volunteer and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act workers to install weatherization materials. Requires the coordination of the weatherization program with other programs of local governments and projects undertaken pursuant to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Repeals the priority in receiving weatherization grants given to community action agencies which have participated in the emergency energy conservation program under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary standards and procedures for the weatherization programs in order to achieve uniform results among the States in areas with similar climates. Directs the President to appoint an energy conservation coordinator to develop a consensus among the Federal agencies responsible for developing energy conservation standards, including fuel price projections, discount rates, inflation rates, climatic character of construction materials. Requires such factors and data to be used by all Federal agencies. Directs the President to report to Congress on such coordination efforts.
