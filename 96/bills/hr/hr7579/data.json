    "text": "Public Buildings Act Amendments of 1980 - Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to authorize the Administrator of General Services to carry out preliminary engineering and design for the alteration of a public building before a project for such alteration is authorized. Requires approval by the appropriate congressional committees before: (1) acquiring a public building by exchange of property worth more than $500,000; (2) leasing space in a building at a rate in excess of $500,000; (3) altering leased premises if the cost of alteration exceeds $250,000; and (4) reducing the amount of space in an approved project by more than ten percent. Prohibits the Administrator from leasing any space to accommodate the following, except as may be necessary to meet immediate and urgent requirements that cannot be met in public buildings: (1) major computer operations; (2) secure or sensitive activities related to the national defense or security; (3) offices which would require major alterations; or (4) a permanent court room, judicial chamber, or administrative office for any United States court. Prohibits the Administrator from entering into any lease providing for a rental which exceeds the average of commercial rentals for space and services of nearest comparable quality by more than five percent. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress, not later than the 15th day after Congress convenes each year, a program for that calendar year of projects and actions which the Administrator deems necessary to carry out any duties under the Act. Amends the Act to prohibit the Administrator from using the name of any individual, living or dead, in the name or other designation of any building under the custody and control of the General Services Administration. Repeals the authority of the Administrator to provide space by entering into purchase contracts under the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972. Directs the Administrator to provide, for employees and visitors, sheltered and secure locations and equipment for parking bicycles at public buildings and at buildings leased by the Administrator."
