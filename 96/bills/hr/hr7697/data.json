Eliminates the State share of revenue sharing funds which are currently authorized under such Act. Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individual taxpayers an income tax credit equal to 25 percent of the State and local real property taxes, personal property taxes, income taxes, and general sales taxes. Disallows the current income tax deduction for such taxes for taxpayers who claim a tax credit."
