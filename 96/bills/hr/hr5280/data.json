    "date": "1979-09-14", 
    "text": "Depository Institutions Act of 1979 - Title I: Amendments to the National Banking Laws - Makes changes with respect to the following: (1) the power of national banks to purchase, hold, and convey real estate; (2) trust powers of national banks; and (3) the emergency restrictions on Federal Reserve banks. Title II: Termination of National Bank Closed Receivership Fund - Directs the Comptroller of the Currency to disburse the liquidating dividends from national banks closed on or before January 22, 1934, held by the Comptroller in the capacity as successor to receivers of those banks. Title III: Financial Regulation Simplification - Financial Regulation Simplification Act of 1979 - Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the National Credit Union Administration to periodically review and revise their regulations to assure that such regulations: (1) are necessary and clearly written; (2) have been adopted in a manner which gives opportunity for public participation and comment and the consideration of alternatives; (3) minimize compliance costs and other burdens to financial institutions and the public; and (4) avoid duplication and inconsistencies. Directs such Federal agencies to submit reports on the implementation of this title to the Banking Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Terminates this title five years after its effective date. Title IV: Increasing Home Mortgage Financing - Amends the National Housing Act to reduce the amount of reserves which must be maintained by a financial institution against its accounts insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Amends the Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 to increase the amount which may be loaned by a Federal Savings and Loan Association on the security of a first lien upon homes, dwelling units, or business properties used primarily for dwellings. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to permit each Federal home loan bank to retire stock held by one of its members in the bank until the amount of outstanding advances made by such bank to such member exceeds 20 times the amount of stock held by such member. Repeals limitations on the required security for such advances. Authorizes each Federal home loan bank to make secured advances to its members using such residential home mortgages and obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may prescribe."
