Grants standing to bring such action to any individual who can adequately present the appropriate legal issues and whose tax liability is not directly affected by the challenged tax ruling. Requires that the person bringing a petition for a declaratory judgment notify the Secretary of his intentions at least 90 days before the filing of the petition. Requires the Secretary to publish a notice in the Federal Register that such petition has been filed. Permits intervention in proceedings for a declaratory judgment by any individual whose tax liability is or may be directly affected by the challenged tax ruling. Awards attorney's fees plus an amount not to exceed $100 to any party bringing a petition who prevails on the merits of the case."
