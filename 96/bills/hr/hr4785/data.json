States that a charge shall be treated as a tax with respect to municipal service if such charge is imposed: (1) by the governmental entity providing such service; (2) only with respect to a person who owns any interest in real property located within the taxing jurisdiction and to whom such service is available; (3) on an annual basis or on the basis of any period not exceeding one year; and (4) on a uniform basis. Includes police, firefighting, and trash collection services within the term \"municipal services\". Excludes any service which is not readily available from any person other than the taxing jurisdiction."
