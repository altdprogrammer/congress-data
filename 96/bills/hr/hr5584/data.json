Declares that such lands are subject to a right-of-way which shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior and that all payments of fees for the use of such right-of-way shall be made for the benefit of the Moapa Band of Paiutes. States that nothing in this Act shall deprive any person or entity of any valid existing right-of-way, mining claim, grazing permit, or water right, including any water rights with respect to the Muddy River as decreed by an order of the district court of the State of Nevada on March 12, 1920. Reserves to the United States all minerals on such transferred lands which are subject to the Mineral Leasing Act and the right to enter upon such lands and remove such minerals. Allows restricted lands (whether tribally or individually owned) of such Band to be leased, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, by the Indian owners for a term of 99 years or less."
