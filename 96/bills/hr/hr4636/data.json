Allows an income tax credit for the employment of new employees in labor surplus areas. Allows a 50 percent credit for the first-year labor surplus wages paid by an employer and a 25 percent credit for the second-year labor surplus wage paid for any taxable year. Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $100,000 for any taxable year.
