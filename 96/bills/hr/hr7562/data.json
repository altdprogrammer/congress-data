    "text": "Service Liability Partial Self- Insurance Act of 1980 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction to any taxpayer furnishing professional design services for cash contributions to a tax-exempt service liability trust and for cash amounts paid to a captive insurer (wholly or partially-owned by the taxpayer) for service liability insurance. Defines service liability as liability for tort damages attributable to negligence in, breach of warranty regarding, or defects in the professional construction or modification design of buildings or structures on real property. Limits the allowable deduction: (1) for a taxpayer with a severe service liability problem to a maximum of $100,000, or one of two specified formula sums, whichever is least; and (2) for a taxpayer with no severe liability problem to a maximum of $25,000, or one of two formula sums, whichever is least. Penalizes unauthorized distributions from such accounts except for: (1) corrective withdrawal of excess contributions; (2) distributions when a change of circumstances renders continued maintenance of no trade or business purpose; (3) transfers of rollover amounts; (4) distributions following complete liquidation of the pertinent trade or business; and (5) certain sales deemed distributions. Limits investment of account assets to: (1) Federal public debt securities; (2) nondefaulted State or local obligations; (3) time or demand deposits in certain Federally insured financial institutions; or (4) any other investment asset permissible under law of the State where such account is organized. Treats service liability loss reserves as amounts accumulated for the reasonably anticipated needs of a business, for purposes of avoiding the accumulated earnings tax."
