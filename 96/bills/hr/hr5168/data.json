    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-1233) Military Personnel and Compensation Amendments of 1980 - Establishes a separate hazardous duty pay schedule for enlisted flight-crew personnel. Increases such payments from existing levels. Increases: (1) officers' aviation career incentive pay; and (2) enlisted career sea pay. Authorizes additional station housing allowances to be paid to military personnel stationed in the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) where the actual housing costs exceed by more than 115 percent the housing allowance provided. Replaces fixed travel reimbursement schedules with ones to be determined by the Secretaries of the military departments. Eliminates \"first-class transportation, including sleeping accommodations\" as a factor in determining such reimbursement rates. Includes \"common carrier transportation\" and \"high cost areas\" as factors in determining such rates. Revises pay and allowance provisions for enlisted personnel and warrant officers serving as officers. Increases the basic subsistence allowance by ten percent, effective September 1, 1980. Authorizes advance pay of a dependent allotment when a member of any uniformed service registers such an allotment within 60 days prior to deployment of a unit. Authorizes reserve enlisted members of the Army and the Air Force to retire with at least 20, but less than 30, years of service. Extends through fiscal year 1982, an increase in the authorization for the number of colonels and lieutenant colonels service on active duty in the Air Force. Extends through such fiscal year the authority of the President to suspend the application of provisions which: (1) restrict the number of Navy and Marine Officers who may be promoted from below the appropriate promotion zone; (2) require Marine brigadier generals to have completed three years' service in grade to be eligible for promotion to major general; (3) require certain officers to have completed specific years in grade in order to be eligible for promotion; (4) prohibit officers designated for limited duty below the appropriate promotion zone from being considered for promotion; and (5) require male Navy line officers to have at least two years' sea or foreign service in grade for promotion. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned for such fiscal year to retire and/or separate and grant retired pay (and/or severance pay) to disabled members of the armed forces whose disability was incurred in the line of duty from September 15, 1978, through September 30, 1982, if the President issues an Executive Order to such effect. Extends through such fiscal year the authority of temporary major generals in the Marine Corps to sit on selection boards convened to promote brigadier generals to major generals. Transfers the office of the Chief of Chaplains from the cognizance of the Chief of Naval Personnel, and establishes it within the executive part of the Department of the Navy. Transfers authority to select the Chief of Chaplains from the Chief of Naval Personnel to the President (by and with the consent of the Senate). Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to designate a Deputy Chief of Chaplains. Establishes the office of Deputy Judge Advocate General in the Air Force. Provides that the President shall appoint such Judge Advocate from among qualifying Air Force Advocates. Permits reserve Army and Air Force officers serving on active duty in special positions, designated by the President to carry the grade of general or lieutenant general, to retire in that grade."
