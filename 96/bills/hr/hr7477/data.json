Reduces the civil aircraft use tax rate for the transitional period of July 1, 1980 through October 1, 1980: (1) from $25 to $6.25 plus; (2) one-half cent per pound (currently two cents per pound) of the maximum certificated takeoff weight in excess of 2,500 pounds in the case of an aircraft which is not turbine- engine-powered; or (3) seven-eighths cent per pound (currently, three-and-one-half cents per pound) for each pound of the maximum certificated takeoff weight in the case of a turbine-engine-powered aircraft. Postpones the due date for filing any return of the civil aircraft use tax with respect to any use after June 30, 1980, until October 31, 1980. Amends the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to extend the Airport and Airway Trust Fund from July 1, 1980, to October 1, 1980."
