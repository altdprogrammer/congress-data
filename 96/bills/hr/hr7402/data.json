    "text": "Amends the National Labor Relations Act to declare that it shall not be an unfair labor practice for an employer (other than an employer in the broadcasting or motion picture industries) engaged primarily in the performing arts to make an agreement covering employees engaged or to be engaged in the performing arts with a labor organization of which performing artists are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by specified actions defined as an unfair labor practice) because: (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established prior to the making of such agreement; or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment membership in such labor organization after a specified period. Specifies that such exemption shall not set aside certain provisions under which an employer may not discriminate against an employee for non-membership in a labor organization if such membership was not available under generally applicable terms and conditions or was denied or terminated for reasons other than failure to pay uniformly required periodic dues or initiation fees. Provides that any agreement which would be invalid but for such exemption from the majority status requirement shall not be a bar to specified petitions. Includes for purposes of such Act under the definition of: (1) \"employer,\" any person who is the purchaser of musical performance services regardless of whether the performer of such services is, himself, an independent contractor, employer, or employee of another employer; and (2) \"employee,\" any individual having the status of an independent contractor who is engaged to perform musical services."
