Directs the NRC to estimate the full cost of compliance with such standard for each such powerplant in operation, under construction, or for which a construction license application is pending. Title II: Availability of Funds - Directs the NRC to publish and submit to State regulatory agencies each such cost estimate. Requires a licensee, permittee, or applicant for a nuclear powerplant construction permit or operating license to certify to the NRC that sufficient funds for paying estimated costs will be available at the end of the useful life of such powerplant. Prohibits charging consumers as a result of such assurance, when the powerplant is not in operation or under maintenance. Requires notification of consumers of any additional costs incurred through compliance with this Act. Title III: Reports - Directs the NRC to submit to Congress annaul progress reports on its compliance with this Act."
