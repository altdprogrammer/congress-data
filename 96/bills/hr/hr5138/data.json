Authorizes the appropriation to such agencies of such additional sums as necessary for increased expenses resulting from: (1) statutorily mandated pay raises; (2) payments to the General Services Administration for increased charges for space and services; and (3) increases in postal rates. Requires appropriations to such bodies to be considered authorized only to the extent expressly provided by statute. Requires the OPM to submit to Congress an annual report describing each contract entered into by an executive agency for the performance of a personnel management function or a related activity. Specifies the contents of such report, including: (1) the authority and reason for entering into any contract the cost of which exceeds the estimated cost of agency performance of contracted functions; (2) an explanation of whether the resources required to perform such functions were available in the OPM or another agency; (3) the total number and cost of all such contracts; and (4) the number of full-time employees which would have been required for the agency to perform the contracted functions."
