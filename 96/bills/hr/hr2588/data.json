    "text": "Department of Agriculture Restoration Act of 1979 - Transfers to the Secretary of Agriculture specified functions of the Department of Commerce (National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Office of Sea Grant of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in part), the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (the Bureau of Foods and the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine of the Food and Drug Administration), and the Department of the Interior (the Bureau of Land Management, in part, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Division of Fisheries Research of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Office of Water Research and Technology). Vests such functions in the Secretary in order to permit him to coordinate, integrate, and administer programs conducive to: (1) increasing the production and improving the marketing and the quality of food, fiber, and forest products; and (2) improving the economic condition of families engaged in farming. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate any such function to any appropriate employee of the Department of Agriculture, but prohibits the establishment of any organizational unit within the Department for the sole purpose of carrying out one or more of such functions. Creates an Under Secretary of Agriculture for Domestic Agricultural Affairs to perform functions relating to the productive and marketing of food, fiber, and forest products in the United States and in its territories and possessions. Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to create an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Science and Education."
