Establishes within the Treasury of the United States a World Peace Tax Fund to receive such tax payments. Requires tax forms to contain a checkoff for taxpayers who wish to claim conscientious objector status and designate their tax payments for the World Peace Tax Fund. Specifies that an individual may claim conscientious objector status only if such individual has actually qualified as a conscientious objector for selective service or immigration purposes or declares that he or she is conscientiously opposed to participation in war, within the meaning of the Military Selective Service Act. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury to require any individual who claims conscientious objector status to provide such additional information as is necessary to verify such status. Permits the setting aside of criminal or civil penalties imposed upon a taxpayer for nonpayment of tax prior to the enactment of this Act, if the taxpayer pays the tax (with interest) and satisfactorily establishes that nonpayment was due to his conscientious objection to war. Directs the Comptroller General to determine the percentage of actual appropriations made by the United States from the Federal budget during the preceding fiscal year for military purposes. Requires the publication of such information in the Congressional Record. Establishes a World Peace Tax Fund Board of Trustees. Sets forth the membership structure and duties of the Board."
