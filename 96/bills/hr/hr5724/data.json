Directs the Administrator to establish criteria applicable to the selection, acquisition, installation, and maintenance of smoke detectors and for the selection of participating households and communities. Directs the Administrator to establish minimum performance requirements applicable to detectors used in the projects, after examining and testing detectors available for retail purchase on the enactment date of this Act, and to authorize acquisition of detectors which meet such requirements. Directs the Administrator to ensure that: (1) sufficient opportunity for participation is given to older persons, institutions serving children, and low-income families; and (2) south central region communities which experience substantial risk of fire are included. Directs the Administrator to cooperate with local fire prevention agencies and local communities. Authorizes the Administrator to cooperate with any private entities in carrying out the projects. Directs the Administrator to submit information on project results to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Directs the Commission to evaluate such information and disseminate to consumers information pertinent to the purchase and effective use of smoke detectors. Authorizes the Commission to require the Administrator to design projects so as to produce information to be used in promulgating consumer product safety standards. Directs the Commission to take account of such information relating to potential fire hazards from household appliances or other consumer products. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 to carry out this Act."
