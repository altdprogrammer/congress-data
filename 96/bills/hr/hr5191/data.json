Requires each institutional provider to submit to the State Health Board its proposed prospective budget for the subsequent year which covers all medical services (not merely covered services) and includes the following: (1) anticipated costs, broken down by schedules for specified costs; (2) the proportion of such costs associated with covered services; and (3) anticipated revenues, broken down by source with respect to each class of items of anticipated costs. Authorizes the National Health Board to require accompanying documentation relating to specified factors for purposes of review. Specifies the manner in which certain costs shall be treated in such prospective budgets, including the following provisions: (1) the costs of all physicians' services under contract with the provider shall be included and the amount budgeted for such services shall be reasonable in relation to the cost of obtaining such services on a salaried or other basis, whichever is less; (2) the total cost of wages and fringe-benefits for nonsupervisory employees shall be included and shall reflect any existing collective-bargaining agreement; (3) the costs of furnishing basic services to ineligible individuals shall be included if no other reimbursement is obtainable by the provider; (4) depreciation costs shall not be included, except for certain capital costs, debt repayments, and costs associated with the closing of a facility; and (5) a reasonable rate of return on equity capital with respect to certain proprietary institutions shall be included.

Requires the guidelines to provide for the collection and reporting of data in such uniform manner as the Board may set. Establishes procedures for the review and approval of prospective budgets by the State Health Boards, including the following provisions: (1) each review shall be made public and shall (A) assess whether changes in services or capital expenditures conform to the current plan of the health systems agency in the area (mandated under title XV of the Public Health Service Act) and the most recent State Health Care Improvement Plan; (B) review the quality, accessibility, and effectiveness of provider services, taking into consideration any relevant findings of professional standards review organizations (PSROs) and of any national provider accreditation organization for that category of provider; (2) a provider shall be given the opportunity to comment on any pending disapproval; (3) the State Health Board shall consider any timely recommendations submitted by consumer groups, the provider, and employee organizations, including negotiated recommendations; (4) a State Health Board may delegate its review functions to an independent entity; and (5) such budgets may not provide for any capital acquisition or expenditure unless the provider has participated in a planning process in accordance with regulations. Requires a State Health Board to approve a budget without modification, taking into account the following factors: (1) total limits on anticipated expenditures; (2) the health systems agency plan; (3) demographic factors; (4) the impact of inflation on budget costs; (5) the effects of any approved capital expenditure or reduction, service modification plans, or future wage increases; and (6) certain other efficiency and cost-effectiveness objectives. Requires resubmission of a budget to the State Health Board if a modification is required for excess expenditures. Disallows payments to an institutional provider for covered services not included in its approved prospective budget. Requires each State Health Board to develop maximum fee schedules for covered services (other than durable medical equipment and laboratory services) after opportunity for negotiations with participating providers. Directs the National Health Board to develop guidelines for such schedules which: (1) establish the relative value of particular services, taking into account specified factors; (2) provide for geographical variations in fees, taking into consideration certain criteria; (3) set the maximum fee for a service which can be provided by two or more categories of health personnel at the lowest of the maximum fees authorized for such categories; and (4) include a formula for allowing annual changes in such schedules. Requires payment for the provision of: (1) durable medical equipment and laboratory services to be the lower of (A) the charge, or (B) the reasonable cost of the equipment or service; and (2) drugs and hearing aids to be the lower of (A) the charge, or (B) the reasonable cost of the drug or aid, plus a reasonable professional fee. Directs the National Health Board to establish guidelines for the reasonable cost of durable medical equipment, laboratory services, drugs, and hearing aids which shall be the lowest cost at which any such item of comparable quality is (or could be made) generally available in an accessible area. Provides for the computation of the professional fee with respect to drugs and hearing aids. Outlines procedures for the use of negotiations to determine the amounts of payments to providers. Directs the National Health Board to establish criteria for the selection of the negotiating groups for each of the following groups of providers: (1) hospitals; (2) skilled nursing facilities; (3) home health care agencies; (4) other institutional providers, including community health centers, migrant health centers, and health clinics; (5) physicians; (6) other non-institutional providers, such as pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists; and (7) hospital employees. Sets forth requirements for representation within such groups. Requires that the selection guidelines by the National Health Board shall provide for: (1) differences in the sizes of the various negotiating groups; (2) proportional representation for each type of health-care provider; (3) three-year terms for each representative; and (4) nomination and election methods. Provides that such negotiations shall concern: (1) limitations with respect to payments made to institutional providers on the basis of approved prospective budgets; (2) maximum-fee schedules; (3) reasonable cost levels with respect to durable medical equipment, laboratory services, drugs, and hearing aids; and (4) other cost control methods. Allows a State Health Board to incorporate within its annual State budget the provision of any agreement reached as the result of such negotiations which would keep expenditures within the budgetary limits. Title III- Part C, Determining Amounts of Premiums and Incentive Payments and Benefits - Directs the National Health Board to establish, in conjunction with the adoption of the Annual Budget and after negotiations with consortia, participating insurers, and HMOs: (1) a national community-rated premium; and (2) a national premium rate. Requires the national community-rated premium to be set so that, if such amount were paid by the members of each family enrolled through an employer plan, the total premiums paid would equal the anticipated expenditures under the Annual Budget, including payments to providers for basic services and administrative costs, but excluding administrative costs for the National and State Health Boards, PSROs, contingency funding, and the costs of covered services to persons who are Medicare-, SSI-, AFDC-eligible residents of Federal or State institutions, or members of the uniformed services on active duty. Requires that the national premium rate be set so that the sum of all wage-related and non-wage related premiums, the government payment for unpaid private premiums, and the voluntary premiums under international agreements equals the anticipated expenditures for covered services to Medicare- eligible, SSI-eligible, and AFC-eligible individuals, and residents of Federal and State institutions. Directs the Board to establish a group-related premium for SSI-eligible individuals and for residents of Federal and State institutions who are enrolled in a qualified plan. Requires that: (1) such premium be set so that the total amounts paid on behalf of such individuals equals the expenditures for furnishing care to such persons; and (2) such premium be adjusted annually to reflect the actual cost experience with respect to such expenditures. Provides that the national community-rated premium and the national premium rate are to apply as the State community-rated premium and the premium rate for each State, unless a State is able to provide for reduced premiums by negotiating a lower level of approved expenditures than would otherwise be provided for in the national budget. Requires each State to establish a group-rated premium for AFDC-eligible individuals and residents of State institutions. Requires that such premium: (1) be set so that the total amounts paid on behalf of such individuals equals the expenditures for furnishing care to such persons; and (2) be adjusted annually to reflect the actual cost experience with respect to such expenditures. Permits a participating insurer or HMO to offer eligible individuals (other than Medicare eligibles) an incentive to enroll in a qualified plan by providing additional services or by paying dividends or cash rebates on premiums. Permits an HMO to offer such incentives to Medicare-eligible persons. Sets forth requirements with respect to such dividend and cash rebates, including that: (1) in the case of employed enrollees, they be divided between the employees and employer in accordance with Board procedures; and (2) they not be treated as taxable income to individuals or income under federally-assisted welfare programs, nor reduce any credit relating to a limit on the amount of private premium payments. Sets a limit on the amount of premiums paid with respect to members of a family unit as employees and by members of the family unit. Provides for a refund to families of amounts in excess of such limit. Title III-Part D, Payment and Collection of Premiums - Requires each employer to pay to the applicable consortium on behalf of each employee for each payroll period an amount equal to the product of the wages paid during such period and the applicable State premium rate. Permits an employer (subject to any collective-bargaining agreement) to require employees to pay up to 35 percent of such amount. Requires an employer to pay any voluntary contributions such employee may wish to have made on his behalf. Permits an employer to obtain certification from the Board as an impacted employer and so qualify for: (1) a payment from the Board if such employer is a State employer or nonprofit employer; or (2) a tax credit with respect to other employers. Specifies the formula for determining such payment or credit. Defines terms for the purposes of this section. Requires all persons (with specified exceptions) to pay to the applicable consortium an amount equal to the product of one-half the State premium rate and the amount of non-wage-related income of such persons' family units. Requires such persons to file quarterly information returns in accordance with Board regulations. Authorizes the Board to impose a collection surcharge for untimely payments. Prescribes the payment procedure for premiums under executive agreements. Requires: (1) the Board to make monthly premium payments to consortia on behalf of SSI-eligible individuals and residents of Federal institutions; and (2) each State to make monthly premium payments to consortia on behalf of AFDC-eligible individuals and residents of State institutions. Sets forth rules regarding Government compensation to consortia for certain uncollected premiums and an assessment against State or local governments which fail to make a required employer payment. Title III-Part E Distribution of Premiums - Requires the consortia to: (1) compute for each capitation individual an amount equal to the average anticipated expenditure in the State budget for the individual, including certain administrative costs and funds for the contingency fund, but excluding the administrative costs of the State health board; and (2) report such amounts to the Board for review. Requires each consortium to adjust capitation amounts to reflect for a specific capitation individual: (1) the relative actual costs of providing covered services in the area of such person's residency; and (2) the actuarial risk associated with the individual's characteristics. Requires that such risk adjustment be made to eliminate financial incentives for insurers or HMOs to practice risk selection or experience rating. Requires that the total of capitation amounts and adjusted capitation amounts for enrollees in a State be equal to the total expenditures in the State budget for the provision and administration of covered services, excluding State health board administrative expenses.
