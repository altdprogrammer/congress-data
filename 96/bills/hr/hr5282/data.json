    "text": "Domestic Energy Policy Act of 1979 - Establishes energy supply and demand targets in quadrillion Btu's per year for the United States for the years 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000, for specific forms of domestic energy production, including crude oil and other liquefied fuels, natural gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. Directs the President to submit an annual energy report to the Congress reviewing energy targets approved or revised by Congress in the previous year and proposing recommendations to the Congress for further revision of such targets. Specifies other components of such energy report. Requires the Congress to consider such targets in detail to arrive at a consensus set of figures representing the Nation's energy future, and to formalize such consensus by joint resolution. States that no legislative action authorizing new budget authority in any year for energy programs would be in order in any House until such joint resolution has been agreed to by such House. Requires the President to prepare an energy impact report on any public bill or resolution reported out of any committee of the House or Senate. Stipulates that the preparation of energy targets shall not be construed to comprise a \"major Federal action significantly affecting the environment\" for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
