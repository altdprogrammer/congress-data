    "text": "Public Disclosure of Lobbying Act of 1979 - Requires organizations which expend more than $1,250 per quarter year or which employ at least one individual who spends at least 20 percent of his time for lobbying purposes to register with the Comptroller General and to update such registration annually. Requires the identification of any such person retained for such lobbying purposes. Requires such organization to file quarterly reports concerning such lobbying activities including: (1) listing of total lobbying expenditures including each expenditure over $25 made to or for the benefit of any Federal officer, congressional employee, or Member of Congress; (2) known business contracts with the person whom such organization is attempting to influence; and (3) each organization from which the reporting organization received income during such period. Requires the Comptroller General to refer to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for investigation any payments, reportable under this Act to any person under the jurisdiction of the Committee, that exceed $100 in value in the aggregate in any calendar year to determine if the receipt of such expenditure is prohibited by the Rules of the House. Requires the Comptroller General to make copies of each registration and report required by this Act available for public inspection and copying. Prohibits lobbying within 50 feet of either Chamber of Congress or within 100 feet unless such lobbyist wears an identification tag. Prohibits former Representatives to Congress from lobbying in the Hall of the House. Requires the Comptroller General to render written advisory opinions upon the request of any individual or organization with respect to the requirements of this Act. States that anyone who acts in good faith reliance upon such advisory opinion shall be presumed to be in compliance with this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to enforce this Act using informal methods of conference or conciliation or, if necessary, referring apparent violations to the Attorney General. Directs the Comptroller General to transmit reports to the President and each House of the Congress no later than March 31 of each year concerning activities under this Act. Provides a Congressional veto of rules and regulations promulgated by the Comptroller General pursuant to this Act. Makes any person or organization who knowingly fails to comply with the registration, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of this Act, or regulations promulgated thereto, subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each such violation. Provides criminal penalties of not more than $10,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than two years, for knowing and willful violations of this Act, and for knowingly and willfully making misstatements or omitting material facts. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act and specified provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act."
