    "text": "Illegal Alien Control Act of 1977 - Directs the Attorney General to establish a border patrol force of not less than 3,800 officers. Directs the Attorney General to report to the President and the Congress on the feasibility of: (1) establishing a system for issuing machine-readable identification cards to aliens entering the United States; and (2) utilizing the most current technology in electronic sensing devices in patrolling land borders. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exclude from the definition of the term \"immigrant\" those persons entering the United States for a period of not more than one year to perform temporary services or labor if the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Attorney General that there are not sufficient workers available at the aliens' destination who are willing and able to perform such services. Directs the Secretary to refer to employers who request such certification, workers in the number desired, able and qualified, and who agree to present themselves to commence employment on the date and for the period specified. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to issue social security cards for aliens who may be employed or receive public assistance in the United States. Specifies the information which an alien must provide when applying for a social security card. Requires the applicant to supply either proof of the individual's citizenship or alien status, or an affidavit that the individual was assigned a social security account number at least five years before the date of application for the card. Prohibits the employment or provision of public assistance to an individual specified in this Act unless such individual presents a social security card to the employer or agency and the employer or agency submits required information to the Secretary. Establishes a civil penalty for the violation of such prohibition. Prohibits the employment or provision of public assistance to an alien whose status under the Immigration and Nationality Act does not permit such alien to work or receive public assistance. Establishes penalties for presenting a false social security card or providing fraudulent information in order to obtain employment or public assistance. Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to prohibit the use of Federal financial aid to provide job training or employment opportunities to aliens who are not authorized to work or who are illegally in the United States. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit income tax deductions for wages paid to aliens illegally working in the United States. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the Secretary of Labor, when adjudicating the petition of an alien for admission to perform skilled or unskilled labor, from considering the work experience gained by the alien in the United States during any time while in an immigration status in which employment was not authorized for the alien. Amends the Social Security Act to prohibit the payment of Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits and Medicaid benefits to illegal aliens. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by fine or imprisonment or both."
