    "text": "Consumer Food Labeling Act - Title I: Truth in Food Labeling Act - Truth in Food Labeling Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require that the labels on all foods disclose each of their ingredients in order of predominance and the percentage of each ingredient in the food. Title II: Nutritional Labeling Act - Nutritional Labeling Act - Requires the processor to label any packaged consumer food product with specified information, including an analysis of nutritional contents, net weight and drained weight, where appropriate. Requires such label to state the nutritional value of the commodity, and to appear in conspicuous and easily legible type in distinct contrast with other matters on the package. Requires the conspicuous statement of any difference in weight or volume which may have occurred in the repackaging of a consumer product from a container of any given net content to a container of a different net content. Empowers the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations and to petition for injunctive relief to carry out and enforce the provisions of this Act. Prescribes a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for willful violation of any provision of this Act. Title III: Open Dating of Perishable Food Act - Open Dating of Perishable Food Act - Amends the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act to require the manufacturer or packager of a perishable or semiperishable food to state on its label the pull date for such food and the optimum temperature and humidity conditions for its storage by the ultimate consumer. Requires pull dates also on shipping containers or wrappings. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the display, offer for sale, or sale of any such food whose pull date has expired. Prohibits the change, alteration, defacement, or removal of any pull date before sale of such food to the ultimate consumer. Prescribes criminal penalties for the violation of this Act. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to report annually to Congress on the enforcement of this Act. Title IV: Marketing Practices Disclosure Act - Marketing Practices Disclosure Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require that labels on packaged foods contain the names and places of business of the manufacturer, the packer, and the distributor, not, as currently, only one of them. Title V: Consumer Food Grading Act - Consumer Food Grading Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and promulgate a system of retail quality grade designations for consumer food products expressed in a uniform nomenclature, giving consideration to nutritional quality and wholesomeness of food products, as well as acceptability. Title VI: Unit and Item Pricing Act - Unit and Item Pricing Act - Amends the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act to require retailers to mark plainly the total selling price of any packaged consumer commodity on its package, and the retail unit price on either the package or a point of display, like a shelf, in close proximity thereto. Exempts from the requirements of this Act certain small retail outlets, and any retail outlet in any State or political subdivision which has enacted mandatory unit pricing laws which are, in the judgment of the Federal promulgating authority, superior to the requirements of this Act. Title VII: New Ingredient Notification Act - New Ingredient Notification Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require any food product to carry a label setting forth in a conspicuous manner any change in its ingredients for six months after such change. Title VIII: Misleading Brand Names Act - Misleading Brand Names Act - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to make it an unfair or deceptive act or practice to advertise a brand name of a product which inherently misleads the public as to the product's value, quantity, quality of contents, or performance."
