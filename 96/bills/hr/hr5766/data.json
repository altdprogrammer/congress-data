    "as": "House receded and concurred with amendment", 
    "date": "1980-08-28", 
    "text": "(House receded and concurred in Senate amendments with amendments) Extends the age limitation for specially selected members of the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) from 25 years to 29 years. Eliminates provisions of law allowing not more than 20 percent of cadets and midshipmen to be appointed as officers in the Armed Forces from the two-year R.O.T.C. course. Provides an alternative eight-year (unless otherwise extended) term of service in the Reserve as one of the requirements for a R.O.T.C. scholarship. Stipulates that such service may include periods of active duty, active duty for training, and other active or inactive service. Increases the maximum number of such scholarship recipients in the Army program from 6,500 to 12,000. Authorizes additional scholarships to be awarded to eligible students at a military junior college. Defines \"military junior college\" as a civilian postsecondary educational institution essentially military in nature that does not confer baccalaureate degrees and that meets other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Army. Establishes eligibility criteria for such scholarship recipients, including: (1) United States citizenship; (2) enlistment in an Army Reserve unit; and (3) service as a commissioned officer in the Army Reserve or the National Guard for at least eight years. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to order a scholarship recipient who does not complete the course of instruction, or who refuses to accept a commission upon completion of instruction, to serve on active duty for up to four years. Authorizes the Secretary to delay the commencement of such Reserve service until completion of a graduate or undergraduate degree. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to require any person eligible for advanced educational assistance to enter into a written agreement with such Secretary prior to the granting of such assistance. Provides that within the agreement such person agree to: (1) complete any educational requirements and serve on active duty for a specified period; (2) serve on active duty for a specified period upon failure to complete the educational requirements; (3) reimburse the United States for any unserved portion of active duty; and (4) such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. Directs the Secretary concerned to determine the period of active duty to be served for such assistance. Declares that any amounts to be reimbursed under such agreement shall be debts owing to the United States. Provides that a discharge in bankruptcy does not release such person from any obligation to reimburse the United States if the final decree for such discharge was issued within five years after the last day such person agreed to serve on active duty. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reimburse any member of the Armed Forces on sea duty for expenses incurred in obtaining quarters, when such member is deprived of quarters on board ship because of repairs or other uninhabitable conditions. Stipulates that such members stationed at locations near their dependents are not eligible for such reimbursement. Includes periods of time for required drills and field exercises of members of the National Guard as service credit for Reserve duty. Repeals the authority of the Director of the Selective Service to determine whether or not a member of the Standby Reserve is available for active duty. Provides that punitive forfeitures resulting from a commanding officer's non-judicial punishment be transferred to the fund in support of the Soldiers' Home."
