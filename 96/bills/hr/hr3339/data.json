    "text": "Authorizes and directs the Comptroller General to establish and administer a personnel management system for the General Accounting Office (GAO) which adheres, with specified exceptions, to existing laws governing the hiring, promoting, and disciplining of Federal employees. Requires that under such system: (1) appointments, promotions, and reassignments shall be based solely on fitness and merit; (2) GAO employees shall receive equal pay for equal work; (3) employees shall be promoted or demoted according to a performance appraisal based on objective criteria; (4) employees shall be removed, reduced in grade, suspended, or furloughed only for unacceptable performance to promote the efficiency of the service; and (5) all appeals and complaints shall be adjudicated fairly. States that under such system: (1) applicants and employees of the GA0 who qualify for veterans' preference shall be entitled to the rights granted to such preference eligibles; and (2) an employee who completes one year of service in a non-temporary position may be appointed non-competitively to a position in the competitive service. Includes GAO employees under provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting discriminatory practices in employment by the Federal Government."
