Rept. 96-229) Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to allow States to combine funds made available under such Act and the National School Lunch Act for the administration of child nutrition programs. Extends the authorization of appropriations to fiscal year 1982 for: (1) minimum payment for State administrative expenses, including unused fund availability; and (2) general State administrative expenses. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish standards, to be effective 90 days after enactment of this Act, for the administration of programs under such Act and the National School Lunch Act to ensure that such programs are administered properly and effectively by the States. Requires that such standards be published in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to taking effect. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold applications from any State upon a determination that such State fails to comply with such standards."
