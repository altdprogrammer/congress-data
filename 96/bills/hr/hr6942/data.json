    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 96-1471) International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980 - =Title I: Military and Related Assistance Programs= - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to require the President to report to Congress concerning the transfer to third countries of specified defense articles and services before consenting to such transfer. Exempts certain transfers to North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries, Japan, Australia, or New Zeland from the congressional certification requirements. Prohibits personnel performing defense services from giving training and advice that may engage U.S. personnel in combat activities (currently prohibited from giving training, advice, or other assistance regarding combat activities). Requires the President to report to Congress if significant hostilities involve a country in which U.S. personnel are performing defense services. Authorizes the President to enter into agreements for cooperative reciprocal training with Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Repeals current provisions which require ten percent of the principal amount of arms sales guaranties be reserved. Provides for the present reserve to remain available. Directs the President to report to Congress whenever the reserve falls below a specified amount. Credits amounts received from foreign governments and international organizations for claims to such reserve after claims based on such guaranties have been paid. Requires annual reports to Congress concerning such reserve. Prohibits credits and loan guarantees in excess of amounts appropriated for such purposes. Authorizes the President to sell or contract to sell design or construction services to eligible countries or international organizations if the United States is paid in full in advance for the costs of furnishing such services. Makes such sales subject to the statutory provisions applicable to defense articles and services. Requires the President to certify information to Congress concerning any letter of offer to sell any design and construction services for $200,000,000 or more. Authorizes appropriations for foreign military sales for fiscal year 1981. Establishes separate ceilings on the total amount of credit and of loan guaranties authorized to be extended for fiscal year 1981. Increases the amount earmarked for Israel. Makes a specified amount available only for the costs of relocating Israeli forces from the Sinai. Exempts Israel from specified credit and loan guaranties restrictions for fiscal year 1981. Releases Israel from a specified amount of its contractual liability to repay the United States. Grants a ten year grace period before Egypt, the Sudan, Greece, and Turkey are required, and Somalia may be required, to begin repayment of the principal of loans guaranteed to finance credit sales of defense articles and services. Raises the ceiling on arms sales which are required to be sold under the Arms Export Control Act in order to be issued an export license. Provides for a congressional veto of a proposed export license unless the President states that an emergency exists with a detailed justification of such determination. Exempts licenses for the NATO countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand from the veto provision. Authorizes the President to require exporters to keep the President informed of arms sale negotiations. Requires that information on licensed commercial exports be included in the annual Arms Sales Proposal. Directs the President to review the current U.S. Munitions List and recommend to Congress which items should be removed. Expresses the sense of Congress that items should not be removed from such controls under the Arms Export Control Act and transferred to controls under the Export Administration Act if they: (1) are specifically designed for military uses; (2) contain sensitive technology; (3) are related to nuclear weapons development or delivery; or (4) otherwise warrant continued export control under the Arms Export Control Act. Directs the President to study and report to Congress on whether export licenses under the Arms Export Control Act should be permitted to be issued to Argentina for exports of communications and electronic equipment, helicopters, propeller aircraft, trucks and vehicles, and defense services relating to such terms. Directs the President to report to Congress concerning leases of defense property to foreign governments for more than six months. Makes such lease agreements subject to the approval of the Secretary of State. Exempts specified exports of uranium depleted in the isotope 235 from the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, when such exports are subject to controls pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act or the Export Administration Act of 1979. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to include the Senate Foreign Relations Committee among the committees to be notified before any export license is approved for goods to countries supporting international terrorism. Requires such committees to be notified at least 30 days before approval.
