    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require that any mandatory transcript of any meeting held to develop or implement an international voluntary agreement or plan of action concerning the international energy program be made available to representatives of committees of Congress within 14 days. Extends the authority for the international voluntary agreement provisions through October 31, 1981. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, to report to the appropriate committees of Congress, within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, with respect to the sunshine requirements of such Act. Requires such report to discuss: (1) to what extent any meeting regarding the development or implementation of a voluntary agreement or plan of action should be open to interested persons; (2) the policies and procedures of Federal agencies in reviewing and making or not making public transcripts of such meetings; (3) to what extent the classification of such transcripts should be carried out by one agency; (4) the adequacy of actions by the responsible Federal agencies in supervising the implementation and enforcement of the standards and procedures governing such meetings, including the monitoring of the overall program concerning any anticompetitive effects; and (5) the actions taken, or to be taken, to improve the reporting of energy supply data under the international energy program, and of any other data required by such Act."
