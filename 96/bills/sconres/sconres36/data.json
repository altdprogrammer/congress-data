Sets forth the House projections of budget aggregates for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Directs each standing committee of the House of Representatives which has jurisdiction over entitlement programs to include in its required March 15, 1980, report to the Budget Committee specific recommendations for funding mechanisms which would enable the Congress to exercise more fiscal control over such entitlements. Directs the Budget Committee to submit to the House such recommendations as it deems appropriate based on such reports. Reaffirms the commitment of Congress to find a way to relate accurately the outlays of off-budget Federal entities to the budget. Estimates such outlays to be $16,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1980."
