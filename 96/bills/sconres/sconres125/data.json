    "text": "Expresses the sense of Congress that by January 1, 1981, the President should call a Convocation on American Federalism in order to bring together elected officials of Federal, State, and local governments to stimulate a national assessment of the Federal system of government. States that the Convocation should: (1) define which governmental functions are inherently national in nature or inherently State or local in nature; (2) examine the allocation of such functions; (3) identify any necessary changes in current functional or programmatic roles of each level of government; (4) define the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce and the use of such power to preempt State and local regulatory authority; (5) define the limits on the power of Congress to attach conditions to the distribution of Federal financial assistance; (6) develop strategies to simplify the Federal grant system and to ensure that the system is utilized only where direct provision of services by the Government would not be effective; and (7) establish procedures for the publication of a final report by 1982 and interim reports as necessary. Declares that delegates to the Convocation should be authorized to conduct regional and State conferences to prepare for the Convocation. States that the Chairman of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations should: (1) provide financial assistance to State and local governments for conducting such conferences; and (2) direct the planning and administration of the Convocation until the delegates elect the Chairman of the Convocation."
