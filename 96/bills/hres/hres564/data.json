    "text": "Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to add a new rule which declares that if a Member has been convicted for the commission of a felony arising out of his official conduct as a Member or in connection with his election as a Member, or is imprisoned for the commission of any felony, it shall be in order as a motion of high privilege to move to expel such Member from the House. Declares that if a Member has been convicted of any felony, it shall be in order as a motion of high privilege to move to suspend the privileges of the Member to vote on any question at a meeting of the House, of the Committee of the Whole House, or of any standing or select committee of the House. Prohibits such a motion from being made if: (1) the conviction for the commission of such felony has been overturned; or (2) the Member has completed any prison, probationary, parole sentence and completed the payment of any fine imposed with respect to the conviction for the commission of such felony. Requires a two-thirds concurrence of the Members present and voting, a quorum of the Members being present, before any Member may be expelled from the House. Requires a motion to expel a Member to be printed in the Congressional Record on the third legislative day before the date on which such motion is offered."
