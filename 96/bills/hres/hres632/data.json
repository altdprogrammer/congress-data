    "text": "Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to specify that committees shall have responsibility for considering and reporting any provisions within their subject matter jurisdiction whether contained in an introduced bill, resolution, or committee amendment. Directs the Speaker of the House to prescribe an appropriate time limitation for committees to consider any bill or resolution, and that upon expiration of such limitation, such committee shall be discharged from further consideration if it has not taken any formal action. Provides that referrals of a bill divided into two or more parts to different committees may be concurrent or sequential. Requires the Speaker, when making such referrals, to designate the committee which has predominant jurisdiction as the committee of primary responsibility, and to prescribe a time period within which other committees of referral shall make their report. Allows the referral to other than the primary committee either at the initial time of referral or after the matter has been reported by the committee or committees initially referred. Repeals the provision of the Rules which prohibits the referral of any bill or resolution to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Makes amendments in this Act effective prior to noon on January 3, 1981."
