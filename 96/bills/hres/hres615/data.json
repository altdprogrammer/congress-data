Requires such calendar to set forth: (1) the number and title of such bill or joint resolution, and the date or dates on which it was reported from committee and referred to the appropriate calendar; (2) the particular provisions or requirements of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 which such bill or joint resolution violates; (3) the number of the resolution containing such waiver and the number of the accompanying report, if a waiver of any provision or requirement of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been reported by the Committee on Rules; and (4) a tabulation of the progress of congressional action on bills and resolutions providing new budget authority or changing revenues or the public debt limit for a fiscal year. Stipulates that such tabulation shall be based on a determination of estimates of budget outlays and revenues made by the Committee on the Budget and the most recent periodic report provided by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. Requires the Committee on Rules, whenever it reports a resolution waiving one or more provisions or requirements of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, to include in its report or in an accompanying statement a brief explanation as to why such waiver is necessary."
