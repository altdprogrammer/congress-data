    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on House Administration with amendment, H. Rept. 96-352) Entitles each Member of Congress to employ 18 permanent clerks under the clerk hire allowance. Exempts from such limitation four employees designated by the Member to the Clerk of the House as falling into one of the following categories: part-time employees, employees compensated by more than one employing authority of the House, interns, employees on leave without pay, and temporary employees. Stipulates that employees designated as temporary employees or interns shall not be eligible to participate in the health and life insurance program or the Civil Service Retirement Act. Revises salary expenditures for permanent employees to one-tenth per month of the annual clerk hire allowance, not to exceed one-fourth of such allowance in one quarterly period. Restricts part-time employees to 15 working days per month, interns to 120 days per year, and temporary employees to three months per year, and limits rates of compensation for such employees. Directs the Committee on House Administration to adopt such rules and regulations as necessary to carry out the provisions of this resolution. Makes this resolution effective the first day of the first month beginning after the month in which it is agreed to."
