    "text": "Declares that it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the Secretary of Agriculture, using all the agencies of his Department and working closely with the State land grant colleges, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Cooperative Federal-State Extension Service, devote increased emphasis to teaching farmers how to better market their agricultural commodities. Urges the Secretary, in consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to appoint a task force to educate farmers as to the availability of futures markets and forward contracting as a means of hedging against future risks. States that the Secretary should report to the House with plans 120 days after enactment of this Resolution."
