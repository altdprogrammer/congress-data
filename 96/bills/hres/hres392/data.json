Declares that the President should establish a task force to examine modifications in the implementation of the Clean Air Act that could increase coal use without violating national ambient air quality standards. Declares that the appropriate House committee should review current regulations of the Office of Surface Mining of the Department of the Interior to insure that such regulations conform with the original intent of Congress in passing the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977. States that the President should submit to Congress within 60 days of enactment of a plan which will achieve the goals of this resolution."
