Prohibits a committee from reimbursing a committee Member or employee for travel expenses unless: (1) the Member or employee files a written request with the committee chairman before the travel is undertaken, or, in the case of an emergency, an oral request to convene a meeting of the committee to authorize the travel; (2) such request sets forth the itinerary, legislative objectives, and projected cost of such travel; and (3) the committee by rollcall vote, authorizes the travel. Prohibits local currencies owned by the United States from being made available for use outside the United States for defraying the expenses of a committee Member after: (1) the date of the primary in which the Member is a candidate for election to a Federal office (other than the Presidency) but has not been designated or elected as the nominee of a party in the general election; or (2) the earliest of the following: (a) announcement of the Member's intention not to be a candidate; (b) the primary for candidates for Representative in the Member's district; or (c) the adjournment sine die of the second regular session of the Congress."
