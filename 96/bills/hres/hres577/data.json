Requires such calendar to set forth: (1) the number and title of such bill or joint resolution, and the date or dates on which it was reported from committee and referred to the appropriate calendar; (2) the particular provisions or requirements of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 which such bill or joint resolution violates; (3) the number of the resolution containing such waiver and the number of the accompanying report, if a waiver of any provision or requirement of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been reported by the Committee on Rules; and (4) a tabulation of the progress of congressional action on bills and resolutions providing new budget authority and changing revenues and the public debt limit for a fiscal year. Requires the Committee on Rules, whenever it reports a resolution waiving one or more provisions or requirements of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, to include in its report or in an accompanying statement a brief explanation as to why such waiver is necessary."
