Prohibits any subcommittee of a committee, during the remainder of the 96th Congress, from meeting in the District of Columbia, except for the purpose of taking testimony or receiving evidence, unless the chairman of the committee has specifically authorized in writing the subcommittee meeting. Requires all committees and subcommittees of the House to use the scheduling service provided through the House Information System to eliminate, insofar as possible, any meeting and scheduling conflicts. Requires each committee of the House, except the Committee on Rules, to promptly enter into the committee scheduling service of the House Information Systems the date, place, and subject matter of any committee hearing."
