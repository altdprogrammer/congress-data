Prohibits any annual increase in the amount of money expended by the United States in any fiscal year greater than 80 percent of the increase in consumer prices during the previous year measured by such index. Limits the annual increase in Federal expenditures in any fiscal year following two consecutive fiscal years in which the budget of the United States was balanced or carried a surplus to the percentage increase in the designated consumer price index during the previous year. Authorizes the Congress to suspend the requirements of this Article during a time of war or national emergency."
