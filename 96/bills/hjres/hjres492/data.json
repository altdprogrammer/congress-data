Prohibits a treaty from permitting any foreign power or international organization to supervise, control, or adjudicate (1) the rights of U.S. citizens within the United States or (2) matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States. Predicates the effectiveness of a treaty as internal law of the United States upon the passage of appropriate legislation. Requires executive agreements with foreign powers or international organizations to be made in the manner and to the extent prescribed by law."
