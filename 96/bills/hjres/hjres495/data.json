    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to raise the price support levels for milk, wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton to 90 percent of their respective parity prices. Reduces the price levels at which producers participating in the wheat and feed grains storage program: (1) may redeem and market commodities securing price support loans (from between 140 to 160 percent of their respective parity prices to 100 percent); and (2) must repay such loans (from 175 to 110 percent of their respective parity prices). Prohibits the Commodity Credit Corporation, whenever the extended loan program for producer storage is in effect, from selling any of its stocks of wheat or feed grains at less than 110 percent of the then current parity price of such commodity."
