Requires a majority vote to enact a proposed law. Provides that no law which is adopted shall be subject to approval by the President. Declares that any law to repeal or amend a law passed by popular vote during the two years immediately following its effective date must receive an affirmative rollcall vote of two-thirds of the Members of each House of Congress."
