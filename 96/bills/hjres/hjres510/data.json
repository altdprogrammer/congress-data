Prohibits the Commission from using funds provided by this resolution to promulgate new trade regulation rules or to initiate any new activities. Prevents trade regulation rules promulgated after August 30, 1979, from becoming effective during the period covered by this resolution unless the Congress enacts authorizing legislation. States that such continuing appropriations shall remain available until the enactment of an appropriation for the Commission or April 30, 1980, whichever first occurs."
