    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the people of the several States and the District of Columbia shall elect the President and Vice President. Requires each voter to cast a single vote for two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President. Requires that if a Presidential candidacy receives a plurality of at least 40 percent of the votes cast, such candidacy shall become the President and the Vice President elect. Requires the election to be held on a day which is uniform throughout the United States. Directs Congress to assemble in special session on the first Monday of December if, after any such election, no Presidential candidacy receives 40 percent of the vote. Requires the Senate and the House of Representatives sitting in joint session to choose immediately, from the two pairs of persons joined as candidates who received the highest number of votes cast in the election, one such pair by ballot. Directs that the law of each State shall govern within such State as to any matter with respect to which the Congress is granted legislative power under this Amendment as long as not inconsistent with any Act of Congress. Gives Congress the power to provide by law for the manner in which the candidacies to appear on the ballot are determined, the places and manner in which the election is held, and the manner in which its outcome is determined. Requires that voters possess the same qualifications as apply in such State in election of Senators, except that Congress may prescribe uniform qualifications regarding age and residence. Allows Congress to provide for the case of death or withdrawal of a candidate on or before the date of the election. Gives Congress power to establish nominating procedures for Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates."
