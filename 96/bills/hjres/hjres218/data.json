Prohibits the total outstanding debt of the United States from exceeding 30 percent of the gross national product. Suspends such prohibitions during a declared war or upon the adoption of a joint resolution, approved by the President, stating that a national emergency so requires. Permits expenditures to exceed revenues in any fiscal year for which the Congress projects a real growth rate of the economy of less than three percent. Requires any resulting deficit to be extinguished within five fiscal years."
