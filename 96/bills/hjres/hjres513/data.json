Declares it U.S. policy to halt official travel to the United States by Soviet scientists and scholars, which is not directly beneficial to the United States, for at least six months. Recommends that all governmental agencies, private agencies, scientists, and engineers be requested to defer all official travel to the Soviet Union related to scientific and technological cooperation for at least six months. Calls upon foreign governments, professional societies, scientists, and engineers to join in similar actions. Directs the President to assure that all Federal agencies take coordinated action should any circumstances change. Urges Federal agencies, together with governments and scientists of all nations, to develop standards for the conduct of international cooperative research and research communication and for the protection of the human rights of scientists. Directs the President to report to Congress concerning the appropriate policies to further this resolution and steps taken to assure coordinated Federal agency actions."
