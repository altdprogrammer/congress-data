Stipulates that (1) Constitutional amendments; (2) a declaration of war; and (3) a callup of the militia shall not be included within the scope of such referendum power. States that a law may be proposed by presenting a petition to the chief law enforcement officer of the United States containing the proposed law and signed by at least three percent of the registered voters who voted in the last Presidential election (which includes at least three percent of the registered voters in 25% of the States). Requires a majority of the electoral votes for a proposed law to be enacted. States that each State shall have a number of electoral votes equal to the number of Senators and Representatives it has. Provides that the District of Columbia shall have a number of electoral votes equal to the number of Senators and Representatives it would have if it were a State (but no more votes than the least populous State). Declares that any law to repeal or amend a law passed by popular vote during the two years immediately following its effective date must receive an affirmative roll call vote of two-thirds of the Members of each House."
