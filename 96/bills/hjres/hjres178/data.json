Authorizes the suspension of such prohibition in time of war declared by Congress or by a concurrent resolution passed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress. Stipulates that any unanticipated deficit in any fiscal year shall be considered an expenditure for the succeeding fiscal year. Directs the Congress to provide an appropriate increase in the level of total receipts if the amount of such deficit exceeds two percent of the total expenditures for the succeeding fiscal year. Authorizes the Congress to apportion any deficit over the four following fiscal years or, by a two-thirds vote of both Houses, to include such deficit in the debts of the United States."
