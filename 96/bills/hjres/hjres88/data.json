    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Requires the total number of electoral votes to be equal to the number of Senators and Representatives to which each State and the District constituting the seat of Government of the United States is entitled in Congress. Establishes a procedure to allocate electoral votes whereby the person receiving a plurality of popular votes for President or Vice President in each State shall receive two electoral votes. Provides that from the remaining number of electoral votes each person receiving votes for President or Vice President shall be credited with a number of electoral votes which bears the same ratio to the total number of such remaining electoral votes as the number of votes received by him for President or Vice President bears to the total number of votes cast for President or Vice President. Grants to Congress the power to establish a uniform time for electing the President and Vice President. Requires each State to compile lists of all persons receiving votes for President or Vice President and the number of votes cast for each person. Directs each State to certify and transmit such lists to Congress at which time the President of the Senate, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, shall credit votes to each person for whom votes were cast in the manner prescribed by this article. Provides that the person receiving the highest number of total electoral votes for President shall be President and the person receiving the highest number of electoral votes for Vice President shall be Vice President. Stipulates that in the event two or more persons receive equal electoral votes for President or Vice President, the House of Representatives shall choose the President and the Senate shall choose the Vice President."
