Excludes such allowances from being considered as income resources for purposes of any other public assistance program. Directs the Governor, in the State Funding Plan, to provide assistance for those who pay their fuel bills indirectly as well as directly. Requires that revenues received from any windfall profit taxes imposed on domestic crude oil producers shall be used to reimburse the United States Treasury in an amount equal to the amount of funds appropriated to carry out this Act. Directs States to provide for determining the extent to which increases in rents are caused by increases in heating costs and to consider such portions of rent increases to be increases in heating costs."
