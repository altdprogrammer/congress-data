Requires the President to institute policies which will give priority to the expeditious leasing and development and production of oil, natural gas, coal, oil shale, tar sands, and geothermal resources on Federal lands. Requires the President to submit to an advisory panel a list of restrictions required by Federal law or court order which impede the leasing of energy resources on Federal lands or on the Outer Continental Shelf. Directs the panel to review the restrictions submitted by the President and submit to Congress and the President a report on: (1) the reasonableness of such restrictions; and (2) appropriate legislative or administrative actions to reduce or eliminate impediments to the leasing of energy resources on Federal lands or the Outer Continental Shelf. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to order substantial lease sales, for private development only, within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Bars civil actions challenging any such lease sale which are brought more than 30 days after the date such lease sale is announced. Exempts any such lease sale from the environmental impact statement requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Requires the President to direct that leasing priority be given to areas of the Outer Continental Shelf that have the highest hydrocarbon potential and known hydrocarbon reserves. Sets forth the conditions for the issuance of Outer Continental Shelf leases by the Secretary of the Interior. Sets forth the requirements for the appointment by the President of members of the advisory panel."
