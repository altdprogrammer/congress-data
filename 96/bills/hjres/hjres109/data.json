Establishes a schedule for achieving such a balance by the third fiscal year after ratification of this amendment. Directs the President, at such time, to make recommendations to the Congress for the discharge of the Federal debt. Permits outlays to exceed receipts in time of declared national emergency, but requires any deficit to be made up within four fiscal years following the end of such emergency."
