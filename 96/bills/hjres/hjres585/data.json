States that the two persons joined as candidates for President and Vice President having the greatest number of votes shall win, provided such number is at least 40 percent of the total number of votes cast. Stipulates that if no such candidates have at least 40 percent of the total vote, a runoff election shall be held between the two pairs of candidates who received the highest number of votes. States that in the event of death, failure to qualify, or withdrawal of both the President-elect and the Vice President-elect, the House of Representatives shall elect a President and the Senate shall elect a Vice President. Stipulates that if the House is unable to elect a President by a specified date, a special election shall be held to elect a President."
