Limits obligations of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made pursuant to this resolution to $5,800,000. Prohibits the FTC from using such funds to promulgate new trade regulations or new activities. Prevents trade regulation rules promulgated after August 30, 1979, from becoming effective during the period covered by this resolution unless Congress enacts authorizing legislation."
