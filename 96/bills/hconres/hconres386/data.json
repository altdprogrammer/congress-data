Requires such membership to represent each political party in the same proportion as represented in each House. Directs the Joint Committee to conduct a study to determine the causes of growth in public and private debt, monetary inflation, and trade deficits in the United States since 1945. Sets forth areas of investigation for the committee relative to such growth. Requires the Joint Committee: (1) not later than 15 months after the adoption of this resolution, to report to the Congress on the results of its investigation; and (2) not later than 24 months after such adoption, to report to each House of Congress a bill (which shall not be referred to committee) based on its study and directed at reducing public and private debt, monetary inflation, and trade deficits. Provides that such bill, if the House and Senate are in disagreement, be reported to a conference committee composed of members of the Joint Committee. Terminates the Joint Committee on the date its work is completed, including that of the conference committee."
