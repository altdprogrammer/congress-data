    "text": "Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that the Department of Energy should take necessary steps to maximize immediately the production of middle distillate fuels in the Nation. States that the Department should also act under authority granted in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 to impose reasonable allocation controls on middle distillate supplies in order to provide a reasonable share of such supplies to all end- users. Declares that the Department of Transportation should establish, on an emergency basis, a uniform national minimum truck weight and length standard so long as supplies of middle distillate fuels remain inadequate. Declares that the Interstate Commerce Commission's diesel fuel cost recovery program should be modified to ensure that the owner-operator receives full compensation for rapidly increasing diesel fuel prices. States that such modification should include a review of the figure used to estimate the percent of total trucking revenues used to purchase fuel."
