Calls upon the Secretary of State to study whether those governments which supported the Committee's action are in violation of United Nations principles concerning colonial dependency and denial of the right of self-determination. Calls upon the President to inform those governments which supported the Committee's action that the United States regards such support as an unfriendly act."
