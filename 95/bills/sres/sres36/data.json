Directs the special committee to conduct a complete study of all matters relating to standards of conduct of Members, officers, and employees of the Senate in the performance of their official duties, and to recommend to the Senate a Code of Official Conduct for Members, officers, and employees of the Senate. Requires such study and recommended Code to include, but not be limited to, standards for: (1) annual public disclosure of income, assets, debts, gifts, and other financial items; (2) restrictions on, or the elimination of, outside income from honoraria, legal fees, gifts, and other sources of financial or in-kind remuneration; (3) conflicts of interest arising out of investments in securities, commodities, real estate, or other sources, (4) office accounts, and excess campaign contributions; (5) Senate travel; and (6) engagement in business or professional activities or employment, or other remunerative activities, so as to avoid any conflict with the conscientious performance of official duties. Sets forth the procedure to be used when the Senate considers the resolution reported by the special committee on March 1, 1977."
