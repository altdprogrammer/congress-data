Rept. 95-91) Amends rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate to prohibit, with specified exceptions, presentation of a cloture motion on any pending question unless 24 hours have elapsed since the Senate began consideration of such question. Stipulates that, cloture having been invoked on a proposition, each Senator is entitled to one-half hour to speak on the measure, motion, or other matter, any amendments thereto, and motions affecting the same. Restricts, after a cloture motion is agreed to, further consideration of such measure, motion, or other matter to 50 hours. Allows further reduction or extension of such restriction by a two-thirds affirmative vote. Permits only one motion to reduce time and one motion to extend time in any one calendar day. Amends rule III to authorize the suspension of the reading of the Journal on motion, without debate. Confines corrections in the Journal to an accurate description of the proceedings of the Senate on the preceding day, such corrections to be determined without debate. Amends rule V to make specified rulings by the Presiding Officer as to the presence of a quorum not subject to appeal. Amends rule XV to allow the reading of any amendment to be waived on motion without debate when that amendment has been identified by the clerk and is available to all Senators in printed form. Amends rule XXVII to eliminate the requirement that a conference report be read in its entirety by the adoption of a motion to that effect to be decided without debate if that report is available to all Senators in printed form."
