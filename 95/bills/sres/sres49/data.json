    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendment, S. Rept. 95- 990) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should seek a treaty requiring that, before a nation or a nongovernmental entity within that nation undertakes any major project which may be reasonably expected to have a significant adverse effect on the physical environment of another country party to such treaty or on a global commons area, the government of the initiating nation must: (1) submit an International Environmental Assessment to the affected country and to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP); (2) consult, upon request, with the affected nation or, in global commons area cases, with UNEP, to prevent or minimize potential adverse environmental consequences beyond its territory; and (3) refrain, upon request, from initiating such project for not more than 90 days after submitting such assessment to permit such consultation, unless the initiating nation considers and explains fully that such delay would involve serious risks to life or property or would otherwise be clearly infeasible. Declares that such treaty should: (1) impose responsibility for a good faith effort to settle disputes concerning its interpretation and application; and (2) call for an international conference five years after the treaty enters into force to review operations of the agreement and to consider the need for developing procedures for the assessment of national liability for damage to the environment of other nations or areas beyond national jurisdiction."
