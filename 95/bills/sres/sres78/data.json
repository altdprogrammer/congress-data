Authorizes specified select and special committees to make expenditures from the contingent fund to carry out their duties and functions. Sets forth limits on expenditures which may be made for specified services. Specifies that the amount made available to each such committee from the contingent fund by this Resolution shall be added to the amount made available for the year ending February 28, 1977, and which is unexpended at the close of that year. Extends the availability of such total amounts to such committees through June 30, 1977. Expresses the sense of the Senate that certain staff members of such committees be retained after June 30, 1977, and that certain vacancies caused by resignations not be filled. Extends the period during which certain accrued surplus funds will be available to Senators. Makes certain individuals who were staff members of the Committee on the District of Columbia eligible staff members for purposes of title VII of the Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977."
