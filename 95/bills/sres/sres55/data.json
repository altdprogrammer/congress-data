    "text": "Amends rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate to reduce the time that a Senator shall speak on a measure pending before the Senate from one hour to one-half hour. Limits to 50 hours the time for consideration of a proposition on which cloture was invoked. States that after such time the Senate shall take a final vote unless a motion is made to table, amend, debate or establish a quorum. Revises rule III to allow the suspension of the reading of the Journal by a motion decided without debate and confines motions to correct the Journal to an accurate description of the proceedings of the preceding day. Amends rule V to prohibit appeals from a ruling that no business has been transacted since the last quorum call when the fact is supported by the minute book of the Journal or transcripts of the proceedings of debate. Prohibits appeals from a ruling on a point of order made immediately following a yea-and-nay vote where the presence of a quorum was shown and no business has intervened. Amends rule XV to permit the waiver of a demand for the reading of an amendment presented to the Senate. Amends rule XXVII to permit the waiver of a demand for the reading of a conference report."
