Provides that the Senate may, by resolution, find that any international agreement hereafter entered into which has not been submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent constitutes a treaty. States that it shall not be in order to consider any bill or joint resolution or any amendment thereto, or any report of a committee of conference, which authorizes or provides budget authority to implement any international agreement which the Senate has found to constitute a treaty unless the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification of such agreement."
