    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Rules with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1201 (Part II)) Federal statistical Activity Control Act - Directs the President to make a compilation of all Federal statistical activities and to submit such compilation to Congress. Specifies the type of data to be included in such compilation including the purpose, statutory authority, cost of such activities, and the current status of each statistical activity. Requires the President to: (1) devise an electronic data processing system to continuously update the catalog of statistical activities, and (2) submit an interim report to the Congress on the current status of such catalog and computer system. Prohibits an agency from using any information for statistical purposes unless that activity was included in the catalog required by this Act, once such catalog has been established. Allows the President to provide for an exemption of such prohibition in cases in which the information is to be used for statistical purposes which were not reasonably foreseeable and such collection activity is included in the compilation as soon as practicable. Directs the President to conduct a continuing review and analysis of all Federal statistical activities, individually and in the aggregate, and to submit such report annually to the Congress along with recommendations for any changes in the law. Stipulates that no Federal agency shall initiate a statistical activity not included within the first compilation until such agency has submitted to the Congress a report containing specified information including its cost, the number of respondents involved, and the purpose for which the information is being collected. States that the Bureau of Census and any other Federal agency or establishment in the legislative branch shall provide to the Congress or committee such appropriate information for the evaluation of existing or proposed Federal Statistical activity."
