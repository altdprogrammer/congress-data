Title II: Extension of Food Stamp Program - Extends the Food Stamp program through September 30, 1979. Title III: Payments in Lieu During Fiscal Year 1979 - Eliminates charges and food coupons and replaces them with a program of direct payments to eligible persons, based on the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet. Requires the Secretary to reduce such cost by an amount representing a reasonable investment on the part of a household, not to exceed more than 30 percent of its income, and pay the remainder directly to such household."
