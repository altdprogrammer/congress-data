    "text": "Congressional Oversight Improvement Act - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to direct any Government agency when it finds it may not be administering a law according to legislative intent to consult the standing committee having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the law. Requires an agency, at the request of such committee, to furnish the committee, the Comptroller General, and the Directors of the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Technology Assessment with a report containing: (1) a summary of the rules such agency issued in administering a law; (2) an assessment of the impact of such rules; and (3) recommendations for modifying such law. Requires the Directors and the Comptroller General to submit an evaluation of such report to the standing committee. Provides for the establishment of a strike force to investigate any failure of an agency to file such report. Requires that each report accompanying a measure reported by a standing or conference committee of Congress must contain a Congressional Oversight Statement which: (1) identifies the agency which will administer any law; and (2) indicates ways such agency may assist the committee which is responsible for overseeing the administration of such law. Stipulates that any such report which does not contain such statement must contain an explanation of why the inclusion of such a statement is impracticable."
