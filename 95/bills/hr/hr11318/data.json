Establishes a presumption that the following are disadvantaged indiviudals: (1) Black Americans; (2) Hispanic Americans; (3) Native Americans; (4) other minorities; and (5) other individuals determined by the SBA pursuant to the Small Business Act. Requires every Federal agency soliciting offers or bids for specified contracts to notify potential offering or bidding companies of the requirements of this Act. Requires each potentially successful offering or lowest bidding company to submit a subcontracting plan with its offer. Conditions the award of a negotiated contract to an apparently successful offering company upon a determination by the procurement authority that the final subcontracting plan affords maximum practicable opportunity for participation by small businesses owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals of a contract to a low bidder upon the submission of a subcontracting plan. Sets forth the information to be included in final subcontracting plans. Authorizes every Federal agency to provide incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small businesses owned or controlled by disadvantaged individuals under contracts let pursuant to the negotiated method of procurement.
