    "text": "Nuclear Energy Alternative Act - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, before determining whether or not to grant any construction permit or operating license for a nuclear power reactor, or otherwise to authorize commencement of construction of a nuclear power reactor, to determine: (1) whether there is a need for new electrical generating capacity of the type and amount to be provided by the nuclear power reactor for which a license, permit, or authorization is sought; and (2) whether feasible energy conservation and renewable energy alternatives can be made available to avoid or satisfy the projected increase in electrical demand for which the proposed nuclear power reactor is planned. Provides for evidentiary hearings on which such determinations shall be based. Prohibits reactor construction if alternatives can be put into effect by the license applicant. Requires notification to the affected State prior to commencement of construction, if alternatives are available but the applicant is unable to put them into effect."
