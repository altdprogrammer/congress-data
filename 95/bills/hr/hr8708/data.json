    "text": "Title I: Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to establish procedures for expeditious review of applications for the licensing of sites for nuclear production and utilization facilities. Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to adhere to specified timetables for decisions on various classes of license applications. Requires that the Commission establish procedures, through arrangements with other Federal agencies, for the preparation of a single environmental impact statement for all related Federal actions by the Commission in connection with licensing of such facilities. Directs the Commission to coordinate the planning and scheduling of license and permit proceedings so as to eliminate duplication of functions. Authorizes the Commission to issue site permits for productions or utilization facilities where applications for construction permits have not been filed. Authorizes completion of up to 30 percent of all construction activities by applicants for construction licenses prior to license approval. Authorizes the issuance of combined construction permits and operating licenses. Authorizes the suspension of public hearing requirements for applications for construction and/or operating permits where a site approval permit has been obtained and where no person has requested such a hearing within 30 days of the publication of notice in the Federal Register. Requires that persons requesting such a hearing: (1) have an interest that may be affected by the operation; (2) show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact; and (3) show that a hearing is likely to result in some action which will provide additional protection for the public health and safety, national defense and security, or the environment. Prohibits the issuance of stays of operation pending the outcome of such hearing unless the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction is satisfied. Authorizes the Commission to issue interim operating licenses of up to 12 months prior to the completion of a required hearing where such interim license is found to be necessary in the public interest of avoiding undue delay. Stipulates that such interim licenses may be renewed for similar periods absent good cause shown to the contrary. Title II: Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards to review combined construction (operating permit) applications before the Commission. Title III: Revises provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for consistency with the provisions of this Act."
