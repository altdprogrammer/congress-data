Rept. 95-1525) Amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to make owners and lessess of vessels documented under the laws of the United States for the operation in United States foreign or domestic commerce (formerly foreign, Great Lakes, or noncontiguous trade) or fisheries eligible to enter into agreements with the Secretary of Commerce to establish a capital construction fund for replacing, acquiring, or reconstructing vessels. Redefines \"qualified vessel\" for such purposes. Expands eligibility by modifying the definition of \"eligible vessel\" to include any vessel of five net tons or greater. Allows United States owners of foreign-flag or foreign built ships to deposit earnings from those ships in such fund. Allows United States owners of United States controlled foreign shipping corporations to deposit money from eligible vessels into such fund."
