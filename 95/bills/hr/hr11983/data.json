Stipulates that none of the funds appropriated for 1979 may be used by the Federal Election Commission to audit a House or Senate candidate or his or her authorized committee, unless such audit is based on a finding by the Commission that a violation of such Act may have occurred. Requires the Secretary of State of each State to notify the Federal Election Commission after an individual has qualified under the law of such State for nomination or election to Federal Office. Repeals this requirement on October 1, 1979."
