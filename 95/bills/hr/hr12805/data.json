    "text": "Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to include within the definition of fishing under such Act fish processing at sea. Defines the terms United States fish processors and United States harvested fish for purposes of such Act. Excludes United States harvested fish transferred to foreign ships for processing at sea from consideration as part of the total allowable level of foreign fishing in any fishery subject to the exclusive fishery control of the United States. Includes certain tariffs on fish and fish products imposed by a foreign nation as a factor to be considered in determining individual foreign fishing allocations in such United States' fisheries. Revises certain fishing permit requirements for specified foreign fish processing ships at sea in certain United States' fisheries. Prohibits the transfer of United States harvested fish to any foreign ship (1) not within the United States' fishery conservation zone; and (2) not having the fishing permit required by such Act."
