    "text": "Immigration and Jobs Displacement Reform Act - Prohibits, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the employment or referral for employment of aliens who have not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. Directs the Attorney General to serve a citation upon first-time violators of this Act. Establishes a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each alien if a violation occurs within two years after the service of a citation. Permits a civil penalty to be imposed only after an opportunity for hearing and after the Attorney General has determined that a violation did occur. Provides that one who is assessed a civil penalty and thereafter violates this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction punished by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by one year imprisonment, or both, for each alien in respect to whom any violation of this Act occurs. Permits the Attorney General to adjust the status any illegal alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if such alien has been continuously physically present in the United States since June 30, 1970, and who on June 30, 1977, is the spouse, parent, son, daughter, brother, or sister of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or whose departure from the United States would result in unusual hardship. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose to the Attorney General the name and most recent address of any illegal alien who is receiving assistance under the Social Security Act. Allows the Attorney General to deport any alien who has become a public charge within five years after entry from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen after entry. Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of State in any quarter of a fiscal year in which the Quarterly Unemployment Rate exceeds five percent to reduce the maximum number of aliens who may, during the next quarter, acquire the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Sets forth the formula to be used to compute such reductions."
