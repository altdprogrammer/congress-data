    "text": "Endangered Species Act Amendments - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to establish an Endangered Species Committee. Directs the Committee to review applications submitted by Federal agencies regarding proposed agency actions to determine whether an exemption from the requirement of the Act that Federal agencies take no actions which would jeopardize endangered species or their critical habitats should be granted. Stipulates that such an exemption may be granted only after a public hearing and findings that: (1) there is no reasonable and prudent alternative to the agency action; (2) the action is of regional or national significance; (3) the benefits of the action clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or its critical habitat; and (4) the action is in the public interest. States that no final determination of the Committee regarding an exemption shall be considered a major Federal action purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act."
