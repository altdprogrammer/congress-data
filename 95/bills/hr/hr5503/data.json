Authorizes the President or the Senate to remove the name of any officer from the list of selectees for promotion. Sets forth formulae for computing separation pay for involuntary discharge or release from active duty. Sets forth procedures for the establishment of boards of officers to review the record of any commissioned officer to determine whether such individual should be required to show cause for retention or active duty because of substandard performance, dereliction of duty, or misconduct. Sets forth the rights of the officer involved and procedures to be followed during such inquiry. Abolishes the present rank of rear admiral (lower half) within the Navy and creates the rank of commodore admiral.
