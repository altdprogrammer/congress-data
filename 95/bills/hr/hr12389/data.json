Defines \"publicly draw,\" for the purpose of provisions specifying procedures for selection of prospective jurors, to include drawings made by means of electronic data processing. Provides Federal employees disability and death benefits coverage to Federal jurors. Revises Federal juror fees and allowances to, among other changes: (1) increase per diem pay, and (2) replace set statutory travel and subsistence allowances with standards promulgated by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Requires employers to preserve employment rights of employees serving Federal jury duty. Repeals the requirement of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 that the written plan for jury selection of each United States district court fix a distance, either in terms of mileage or travel time, beyond which prospective jurors may automatically be excused from traveling for jury duty."
