    "text": "National School-Age Mother and Child Health Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to designated State agencies to meet part of the cost of planning and coordinating services for school age girls and their children. Sets forth requirements which the State plans must meet before receiving such grants, including: comprehensive health care to school-age girls (associated with the continuation of pregnancy) and to their children, family planning and counseling, infant and child day care and a coordinated program of social services. Prohibits the collection by, or submission to, the Federal or State Government of identifying information of persons receiving services under this program. Establishes a unit within the Maternal and Child Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to administer and coordinate the program established by this Act."
