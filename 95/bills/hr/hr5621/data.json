    "text": "Independent Regulatory Agencies Act - Requires the presidential appointment of the chairmen of the following agencies (hereinafter referred to as \"Agencies\") to be confirmed by the Senate: Federal Communications Commission (FCC); Federal Power Commission (FPC); Federal Trade Commission (FTC); Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC); and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Permits the removal of any Commissioner of any of the Agencies for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but not for inefficiency. Places control of any civil litigation involving the Agencies or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in such Agencies or the EPA, respectively, and permits the Agencies and EPA to appear in such cases in their own names. Prohibits the submission for approval by the Office of Management and Budget (Office) or any other authority of any communication to Congress respecting legislation by any Federal independent regulatory agency. Requires the EPA to submit to Congress any legislative recommendation, regulation, or proposed regulation which is submitted to the President or the Office. Requires the Office to transmit along with its budget recommendations the original budget texts submitted to the Office by any independent regulatory agency or the EPA. Subjects the EPA to the same preview by the Comptroller General of information gathering activities to which all independent regulatory agencies are subject and, therefore, exempts the EPA from preview of such activities by the Office. Requires the Agencies and the EPA to respond within two days to requests for documents in their possession or control by specified congressional committees, subcommittees, or Members of such committees or subcommittees."
