    "text": "Cancer Prevention Act - Amends that part of the Public Health Service Act which established the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health in order to provide for an expanded research program for the prevention of environmental and occupational cancer. Requires the Director of the Institute to study the feasibility of establishing an integrated national data base which would: (1) assist Federal, State, and other agencies in locating persons exposed to carcinogens and referring such persons to appropriate health agencies; and (2) facilitate studies of the effects of suspected carcinogenic substances on human beings. Directs the Director, in cooperation with industrial and governmental bodies and agencies, to establish programs in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer, including programs to identify and screen populations having a high risk of cancer because of occupational or environmental exposure to known or suspected carcinogens. Requires the Director to assist Federal agencies in the conduct of research directed at identifying environmental and occupational causes of cancer. Requires the Director to annually publish a report listing all known or suspected carcinogens to which a significant number of persons residing in the United States are exposed, and evaluating the existing regulatory controls designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to carcinogens. Revises the composition of the National Cancer Advisory Board."
