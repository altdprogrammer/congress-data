    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to subject an alien who has become a public charge within five years after entry to deportation whether or not such alien is legally liable to repay any public support received. Permits the Attorney General to exempt from deportation any alien who has become a public charge if such alien became disabled after entry. Requires State agencies administering the State plan of Aid to Families with Dependent Children to transmit quarterly reports to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare containing the name and current address of each alien who has applied for or received State aid for needy families with children. Requires the Secretary to transmit to the Attorney General a report containing the name and current address of each alien who has applied for or received benefits under the programs of Aid for Needy Families with Dependent Children, or Aged, Blind or Disabled under the Social Security Act. Directs the Attorney General to initiate an investigation with respect to any alien named in such report to determine whether such alien is deportable as a public charge under the Immigration and Nationality Act."
