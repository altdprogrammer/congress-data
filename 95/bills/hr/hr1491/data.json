Provides for cooperation between the Secretary and foreign governments as well as other executive departments in carrying out this Act. Authorizes (1) necessary inspections and investigations, and (2) such fees and assessments as are necessary to cover the costs of the inspections and certifications required by this Act. Requires all imported dairy products to specify the country of origin on their packaging."
