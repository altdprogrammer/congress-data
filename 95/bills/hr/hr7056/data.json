Requires the statistical definition of farms in the 1979 census not to exclude any establishment which would normally sell more than $600 worth of agricultural products during the census year; or, for census years following 1979, $600 worth, adjusted by a specified percentage. Directs the Department of Commerce to improve the collection, analysis and publication of data about the ownership structure of American farms. Requires publication of information obtained in each such census as soon as practicable, but in no event later than March 1 of the year following the year in which such census is taken."
