Rept. 95-14) Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require air carriers engaged in the carriage of property to give a 60-day notice to the Civil Aeronautics Board of any proposed rate change. Requires air carriers to give a 45-day notice to the Board for any proposed passenger fare change. (Previously a 30-day notice was required for both passenger and property rate changes.) Requires the Board, when suspending a proposed rate change, to notify the air carrier affected at least 15 days before such tariff changes would otherwise go into effect. Prohibits the Board from taking into account any decrease in an air carrier's Federal income tax liability for 1966, resulting from any net operating loss carryback, in determining such carrier's mail rate compensation subsidy. Directs the Board to refund mail rate compensation subsidies to those air carriers which were required to make repayments of excess profits derived from such subsidies."
