Defines \"nonvessel operating common carrier\" as any person, other than a vessel operating carrier, holding out as a common carrier to transport or provide transportation of property in the foreign and domestic offshore commerce of the United States who utilizes the facilities and services of one or more underlying water carriers for a line-haul transportation of the property. Requires that such carriers be licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission. Directs the Commission to establish liability limits for such carriers and to prescribe regulations requiring the carrier to demonstrate financial responsibility by bonding or other measures in the event of property or damage."
