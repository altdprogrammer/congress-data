Continues proscriptions against employees using their official authority or influence to interfere with the result of any election or to coerce the political action of any person. Modifies provisions relating to the solicitation and offering of political contributions by Federal employees. Prohibits employees from: (1) giving or offering to give a political contribution to any individual either to vote or refrain from voting; (2) soliciting or receiving a political contribution to vote or refrain from voting; (3) knowingly giving a political contribution to a superior; (4) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution from another employee with respect to whom such employee is a superior; (5) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution in specified facilities; or (6) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution from or giving a political contribution to an employee, Member of Congress or officer of a uniformed service. Places additional restrictions on specified employees of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice and the Central Intelligence Agency. Prohibits employees, with specified exceptions, from engaging in political activities while on duty, while wearing a uniform or official insignia identifying their position, or in designated areas. Establishes the Board on Political Activities of Federal Employees to decide cases regarding violations of this Act. Directs the Civil Service Commission to investigate reports and allegations of prohibited activity. Requires the Commission to give notice to the Board and the employees involved of apparent violations, except when the conduct of specified officials is involved, in which case the Commission is directed to refer the matter to the Attorney General and to report to Congress and the President. Directs the Board to render a final decision on the apparent violation on the basis of the record after a hearing conducted by a hearing examiner, which record shall include the recommended decision of the hearing examiner and any exception to such decision filed by the employee. Permits an employee upon whom a penalty is imposed by an order of the Board to seek judicial review. Specifies penalties for violation of the prohibitions contained in this Act. Directs the Commission to establish a continuing program to inform all employees of their rights of political participation and to educate employees with respect to those activities which are prohibited.
