Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to enforce such safety rule until a final cellulose home insulation product safety rule is in effect. Establishes procedures for amendments to the interim rule as promulgated by the General Services Administration. Directs the Commission to study: (1) the need for safety standards for other forms of home insulation; (2) the methods of testing such insulation; and (3) the methods of enforcing home insulation standards."
