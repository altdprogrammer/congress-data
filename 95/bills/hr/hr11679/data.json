    "text": "Peace Corps Act Amendments - Amends the Peace Corps Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1978, and 1979, to carry out such Act, and such sums as may be necessary for employee benefits authorized by law for fiscal years 1978 and 1979. Directs the Peace Corps Act to be administered so as to encourage the economic integration of women in developing countries. Repeals the requirement that only one Peace Corps volunteer who is a parent of a minor child may receive a readjustment allowance, even though both parents are volunteers eligible for such allowances. Makes the malpractice protection provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year, 1977, applicable to the Peace Corps. Eliminates instruction in the philosophy and menace of Communism from required Peace Corps training. Authorizes the President to furnish hospitalization and medical treatment to Foreign Service local employees who are in the United States for training, under certain conditions. Amends the purpose of the Peace Corps Act to emphasize the role of the Corps in assisting the poor. Increases the limitation on the settlement amount authorized to settle and pay claims against the Peace Corps. Specifies information to be included in the annual reports to Congress on Peace Corps activities. Revises the sum which may be used in any fiscal year to encourage the development of international voluntary service programs."
