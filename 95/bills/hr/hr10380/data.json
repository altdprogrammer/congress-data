Directs the Civil Aeronautics Board to implement its July 1976 decision on the request of National Airlines for permission to provide nonstop service between Tampa, Florida, and London, England notwithstanding the fact that such decision has not been approved by the President. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require that all new international air services agreements be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. Requires the President to establish advisory committees which will insure that the interests of affected air carriers and localities will be adequately considered in such negotiations. Prohibits United States' involvement in such negotiations unless members of such advisory committee are present and unless representatives of interested United States air carriers and localities have the right to attend such a meeting."
