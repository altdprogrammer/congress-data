Requires that the results of such study be reported to Congress no later than January 1, 1980. Establishes a moratorium on the hunting of wolves from aircraft or other mechanized vehicles. Prohibits all killing of wolves except the killing of individual animals by hunters as game in areas where the wolf is not protected under the Endangered Species Act. Stipulates that such moratorium on the large-scale killing of wolves shall remain in effect pending completion of the study and implementation of legislative recommendations by Congress. Authorizes appropriations of $50,000 for fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980 to carry out the purposes of this Act."
