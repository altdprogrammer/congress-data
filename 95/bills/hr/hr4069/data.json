    "text": "Weather Modification Regulation Act - Title I: Weather Modification Licenses and Permits, Reporting Requirements, and Penalties - Requires any State which establishes a system to regulate weather modification activity to require that any person engaging in such activity in such State obtain a license from such State. Prohibits any person from engaging in such activity unless the person having primary responsibility for such activity has obtained a permit from the Secretary of Commerce. Sets forth the information to be included in an application for such permit. Permits the Secretary to revoke any such permit upon a finding that the holder has violated a requirement imposed by the Secretary, or that such activity poses an immediate or potential danger to the public welfare. Requires the holder of such permit to transmit daily reports to the Secretary with respect to such activity. Authorizes the Secretary to require, by regulation, that any holder of such permit maintain such records as the Secretary may require and give the Secretary the right to enter the premises in which such records are kept. Imposes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Title II: Weather Modification Information System - Requires the Secretary to establish within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration a weather modification information system to monitor daily weather conditions and evaluate weather modifications. Title III: International Weather Modification Control - Authorizes the President to enter into agreements with foreign nations and international organizations to encourage other nations to establish systems to monitor and regulate weather modification activities. Requires any United States citizen who has primary supervisory responsibility for weather modification activity in any foreign nation to submit a report to the Secretary with respect to such activity, prior to engaging in such activity. Requires the Secretary to maintain a register of persons who engage in weather modification activities, and who are qualified to engage in such activities. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
