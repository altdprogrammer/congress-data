Authorizes the Secretary to provide up to 75 percent of the purchase and installation costs of selected systems used for research purposes. Requires the Secretary to formulate definitive performance criteria concerning solar photovoltaic systems and to develop a system certification for conforming systems. Directs the Secretary to consult with relevant Federal agencies concerning the use of solar photovoltaic systems in Federal facilities. Requires the Secretary to set up a development and demonstration program of prototype photovoltaic systems at the Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colorado. Directs the Secretary to establish a solar energy data bank at the Golden facility. Requires relevant Federal officials to ensure that small business concerns are granted realistic and adequate opportunities to participate, to the maximum extent possible, in the programs under this Act."
