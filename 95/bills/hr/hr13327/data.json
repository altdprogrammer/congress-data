Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to relocate endangered or threatened species to areas where they will not be jeopardized by the operation or construction of certain types of projects. Provides that projects funded by Federal monies which jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered species shall be halted under under such Act only if the Secretary of the Interior determines that the social and economic costs of halting the operation are justified because of the benefits to the United States of the continued existence of the species, and the cessation is approved by both Houses of Congress."
