    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove from the class of aliens whose status may be adjusted by the Attorney General in his discretion to that of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence: (1) alien crewmen; (2) aliens who hereafter continue in or accept unauthorized employment (excepting specified relatives); and (3) specified aliens admitted in transit without a visa. Prohibits the employment or referral for employment of aliens who have not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. States that a person will not be deemed to have violated this Act who has made a bona fide inquiry whether a person employed or referred is a citizen or alien. States that a signed statement from such person that he is a citizen or authorized alien constitutes a bona fide inquiry provided that the writing conforms with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Directs the Attorney General to serve a citation upon first-time violators of this Act. Establishes a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each alien if a violation occurs within two years after the service of a citation. Permits a civil penalty to be imposed only after an opportunity for hearing and after the Attorney General has determined that a violation did occur. Provides that one who is assessed a civil penalty and thereafter violates this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by one year imprisonment, or both, for each alien in respect to whom any violation of this Act occurs. Directs any officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose the name and most recent address of any illegal alien whom the employee knows to be receiving assistance under any State plan under specified titles of the Social Security Act. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both."
