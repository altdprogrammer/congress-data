    "text": "(House receded and concurred in a certain Senate amendment with an amendment, roll call #867 (292-112)) Directs the President to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, 117 additional district judges. Directs the President to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, 35 additional circuit judges. Eliminates the exception for certain districts having two judges with respect to the requirement that no judge age 70 or older serve as chief judge. Provides that a court en banc consists only of all circuit judges of the circuit in regular active service. Authorizes any court of appeals with more than 15 active judges: (1) to constitute itself into administrative units complete with such facilities and staff as may be prescribed by the Administrative Office; and (2) to perform its en banc function by such number of members of its en banc courts as may be prescribed by its own rule. Conditions such appointments on the President's promulgating and publishing regulations which establish procedures and guidelines for the selection of nominees on the basis of merit. Permits the President to waive such regulations with respect to any nomination by notifying the Senate of the reasons for such waiver. Provides that no nomination or appointment to a United States district court judgeship may be invalidated on the basis of the President's failure to comply with this Act, or any regulation promulgated under this Act. Suggests that the President, in selecting nominees to the Federal judgeships created by this Act, give due consideration to qualified individuals regardless of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. Requires a $10,000 jurisdictional amount on each receipt or bill of lading which is the basis of an action against rail or motor carriers to recover damages on freight shipments. Authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to place a total of 15 positions in GS-16, 17, and 18."
