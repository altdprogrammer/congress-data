    "text": "Denies veterans' retroactively to any individual whose entitlement is based on an upgraded discharge under specified revised standards not made applicable to all persons administratively discharged or released from active military service under less than honorable conditions. Requires the board of review to make a separate determination whether an upgraded individual would have been awarded an upgraded discharge under discharge review standards made applicable to all persons administratively discharged under less than honorable conditions. Entitles to veterans' benefits any individual whose upgraded discharge would have been awarded under previous unrevised review standards. Denies, as of the date of enactment, benefits for any disability incurred or aggravated during a period of service from which a veteran was discharged by reason of a bad conduct discharge. States that the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs should not promulgate any new or revised regulations providing any unique or special advantage to veterans who have received upgraded discharges under revised standards, or otherwise make any special distinction between such veterans and other veterans."
