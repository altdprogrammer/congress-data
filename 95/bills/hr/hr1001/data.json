Requires, to the maximum extent possible, that sites chosen for programs be located in low-income communities or areas. States that programs assisted under this Act shall, to the extent feasible, include information tours, cultural field trips, athletic activities, and admission to special events. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public or private bodies or agencies, in coordination with units of local government, for the demonstration and evaluation of new methods and techniques of providing recreation support services for concentrations of underprivileged youth. Directs the Secretary to coordinate actions taken pursuant to this Act with those of other departments and agencies. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for fiscal years 1977,1978 and 1979."
