    "as": "House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment",

    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) =Title I:= Establishes the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area composed of a 48-mile segment of the Chattahoochee River and adjoining lands in the State of Georgia from Buford Dam downstream to Peachtree Creek. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands, waters, and interests therein by donation, purchase or exchange. Reserves a right to retain use and occupancy of noncommercial residential property for agricultural or residential purposes for specified owners. Authorizes the Secretary to administer, protect, and develop the recreation area in cooperation with the State or its political subdivisions. Prevents the Federal Power Commission from licensing the construction of any dam, water conduit, reservoir, or other project works on or directly affecting the recreation area. Prohibits any department or agency of the United States from: (1) assisting in the construction of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such area is established, except where such project is determined by the State of Georgia to be necessary for water supply or water quality enhancement purposes and authorized by the United States Congress; or (2) recommending authorization of any water resources project that would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which such area is established. States it is not the intention of this Act to require the manipulation or reduction of lake water levels in Lake Sidney Lanier. Prohibits any construction of this Act as a restriction on the recommendations of the Metropolitan Atlanta Water Resources Study. Authorizes the Secretary to expend not more than $72,900,000 from the Land and Water Conservation fund for land acquisition and not more than $500,000 for the development of essential facilities. Requires that within three years of the effective date of this Act the Secretary shall, after consulting with the Governor of the State of Georgia, develop a general management plan for the use and development of the recreation area. =Title II:= Raises the authorization ceiling for the commemoration of certain historical events in Kansas from $2,000,000 to $2,750,000, effective October 1, 1978. =Title III:= Authorizes a pilot transportation program to promote activities designed to make the national park system more accessible in a manner consistent with the preservation of parks and the conservation of energy by encouraging the use of transportation modes other than personal motor vehicles for access to units of the national park system with minimum disruption to nearby communities. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to formulate and implement transportation plans for units of the national park system. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) contract with existing transportation services; (2) operate such services directly in the absence of suitable and adequate carriers; (3) acquire capital equipment for such services; and (4) acquire lands or waters outside the boundaries of units of the national park system, where necessary. Requires the Secretary to submit a detailed proposal of such acquisition to the Congress for a 60-day review. Provides that any fees collected in the operation of a transportation service shall be covered into the Planning, Development, and Operation of Recreation Facilities appropriation account. Directs the Secretary to establish information programs to inform the public of available park access opportunities and to promote the use of transportation modes other than personal motor vehicles for access to and travel within the units of the national park system. States that transportation facilities and services provided pursuant to this Act shall not be considered as concession facilities or services within the meaning of the Act of October 9, 1965. Requires the Secretary to consult with the appropriate State and local public service commission prior to implementing a new or modified route. States that the authorities in this Act shall not be deemed an expansion of the exemption of the Interstate Commerce Act which provides that motor vehicles operated under authority of the Secretary for the sole purpose of transporting people in and about the national parks shall be exempt from Interstate Commerce Commission regulations. Directs the heads of appropriate Federal departments or agencies to assist the Secretary in the formulation and implementation of transportation projects. Directs the Secretary to prepare a compilation of Federal statutes and programs providing authority for the planning, funding, or operation of transportation projects which might be utilized by the Secretary in carrying out this Act. Requires that such compilation be submitted to the Congress within 180 days from enactment of this Act. Provides guidelines for: (1) public input during the formulation stage of a transportation plan; and (2) implementation of a transportation plan, including the submission of reports to the Congress on projects in excess of $100,000 in any fiscal year. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress, within three years of the effective date of this Act, containing such information as the preservation of natural resource values and effects of the projects on communities. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1979, $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, and $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1981. Provides that any authorized but unappropriated amount shall continue to be available for appropriation in succeeding fiscal years."
