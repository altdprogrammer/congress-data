    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1145 (Part II)) Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations of $6,800,000 and $7,800,000 for fiscal years 1979 and 1980, respectively, for the Environmental Protection Agency to operate the ocean dumping permit program and to carry out regulatory activities. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct research, training, demonstrations, and studies on alternative methods of disposal to replace ocean dumping and to promote and assist private entities in the conduct of such research. Authorizes the appropriations of $7,500,000 for fiscal year 1979, and $9,000,000 for 1980 to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct ocean dumping research. Defines the term \"State\" to include \"any territory or possession of the United States which has a popularly elected Governor\". Grants the Governor of any State the authority to determine, within a specified period of time, which activities shall be regulated by the Secretary of Commerce in the portion of a sanctuary which falls within the State's jurisdiction. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to list those activities which are to be regulated within a marine sanctuary prior to the designation of such sanctuary. Authorizes the Secretary to regulate those activities described in such approved list. Requires the Secretary to hold valid all permits, licenses, and other authorizations pursuant to any other authority. Requires the Secretary to conduct research, surveillance, and enforcement activities to carry out the purposes of the sanctuaries program. Authorizes the Secretary to utilize personnel, services, and facilities of other Federal or State agencies for the purposes of the program. Authorizes the appropriations of $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 respectively, to carry out the marine sanctuaries provisions of such Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to end ocean dumping of all \"industrial wastes\" which are harmful to the marine environment. Defines \"sewage sludge\" and \"industrial waste\" as any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated by either a municipal waste-water treatment plant or a manufacturing or processing plant, the ocean dumping of which may unreasonably degrade or endanger human health, welfare, amenities, or the marine environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities."
