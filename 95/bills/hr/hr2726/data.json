States that individuals employed as Corps members shall be age 16 through 25; shall meet applicable physical standards; shall be given preference if a veteran of the Vietnam War; and may be employed for a total of not more than 12 months. Specifies guidelines to be followed by the Secretaries in administering this Act, including those relative to the types of jobs and projects to be given preference and the wages to be paid corps members. Extends the program under which grants are made to States to assist in meeting the cost of projects for the employment of young people to develop and maintain non-Federal public lands and waters. Designates a time period during which the Secretaries are to develop a plan to carry out the activities authorized by this Act and prepare the site location, facilities, and equipment selected in such plan. Directs the Secretaries, in performing such functions, to plan for a capacity of the extended corps to employ 100,000 young adults during the first fiscal year of operation, 300,000 during the second, 400,000 during the third, and 500,000 during the fourth."
