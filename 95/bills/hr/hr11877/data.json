Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1978 and 1979, $86,544,000 and $112,424,000 respectively, to carry out such Act, and for employee benefits authorized by law $1,069,000 for 1978 and such sums as necessary for 1979. Directs the Peace Corps Act to be administered so as to encourage the economic integration of women in developing countries. Makes the malpractice protection provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year, 1977, applicable to the Peace Corps. Increases the limitation on the settlement amount authorized to settle and pay claims against the Peace Corps. Authorizes the President to furnish hospitalization and medical treatment to Foreign Service local employees who are in the United States for training, under certain conditions. Authorizes the President to assign Peace Corps volunteers to private or governmental agencies to furnish relief assistance to displaced persons. Specifies information to be included in the annual reports to Congress on Peace Corps activities. Allows the Peace Corps to furnish technical assistance, materials, supplies, and training appropriate to the support of volunteer programs in developing countries. Prohibits the use of funds to pay the administration costs of any program (other than a demonstration project) or any program of a paramilitary or military nature. Stipulates that funds allocated for such volunteer program activities be kept to a minimum. Revises the sum which may be used in any fiscal year to encourage the development of international voluntary service programs."
