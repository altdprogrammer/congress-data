    "text": "Domestic Volunteer Service Amendments - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to prohibit assignment of volunteers to any State under any VISTA program unless a plan for such program has been submitted to the Governor of such State and such Governor has not disapproved it. Authorizes the Director of ACTION to override such disapproval if, upon reconsideration by him, he finds the program to be fully consistent with the purposes of VISTA. Requires VISTA volunteers with grievances to use the hearing procedures established by the Act. Makes authorized stipends for volunteers mandatory and increases the maximum stipend from $75.00 to $90.00 per month. Limits the amount of academic credit student volunteers may receive for their work for the University Year for ACTION program. Declares that a volunteer shall not be made to forfeit the rights to any government assistance to which he is otherwise entitled by reason of service in any Federal volunteer antipoverty program and the fact that such person fails to seek or refuses to accept employment or training during the period of volunteer service."
