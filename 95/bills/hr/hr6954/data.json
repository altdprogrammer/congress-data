    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Armed Services with amendment, H. Rept. 95-642 (Part II)) =Title I: Financial Disclosure Requirements of Government Personnel= - Requires certain officers of the uniformed services to file financial reports. Makes such requirement applicable to: (1) all officers of the rank of brigadier general, rear admiral, assistant surgeon general and above; (2) any officer nominated to any of such positions; and (3) officers assigned to duties involving law enforcement, contracting, or advising the President. Requires that such reports contain the: (1) sources and amounts of income and gifts; (2) identity and approximate value of property held in a trade or business or for investment; (3) identity and approximate value of all liabilities owed; (4) identity of positions held with business entities; and (5) description of any agreements with respect to continuation of payments and future employment with former employers. Requires that such reports contain information concerning the income of the reporting individual's immediate family. States that such reports must be filed annually and within 30 days of assuming or leaving a covered position. Specifies that they are to be filed with the Secretary of the pertinent department. Directs the Secretary concerned to either state that the report complies with the law, or specify to the officer the manner in which it is deficient. Specifies that a reporting individual found to be in noncompliance may be directed to take such steps as divestiture, restitution, establishment of a blind trust, or request for an exemption. Directs the Secretary concerned to take appropriate action if such individual does not take the corrective measures suggested. Sets forth penalties for failing to file such statement, or failing to supply information in such report which is required to be reported. Provides Congress with the power to veto any regulation prescribed by a Secretary. =Title III: Conflict of Interest= - Prohibits former officers or employees of the Government from representing any party, or from contracting with the intent to influence any department or employee of the government: (1) permanently, in any matter in which the former employee participated personally and substantially; (2) for two years in matters under such employee's personal supervision; and (3) for one year in matters pending in such employee's employing agency. Forbids partners of former officers or employees from acting as agent or attorney for anyone other than the U.S. before a department or agency in any matter in which such employee participated personally and substantially as a government employee."
