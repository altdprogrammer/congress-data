Exempts from the provisions of this Act orphans who do not qualify as admissible orphans under such Act. Authorizes the Attorney General, at his discretion, to grant permanent resident status to those aliens from such countries who were paroled or admitted into the United States prior to March 31, 1975 who have been physically present in the United States for at least two years if such aliens are admissible for permanent resident status under the Act. Gives the Attorney General discretion to grant permanent resident status to the spouse or child of persons whose status has been changed pursuant to this Act. States that an alien whose status is changed pursuant to this Act shall be exempt from immigration quotas and from exclusions under the Act respecting status as a skilled or unskilled worker, a public charge, or as a person without a valid visa or other current valid entry document."
