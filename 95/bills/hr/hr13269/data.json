    "text": "Endangered Species Act Amendments - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to establish an Endangered Species Committee. Directs the Committee to review applications submitted by Federal agencies regarding proposed agency actions to determine whether an exemption from the requirement of the Act that Federal agencies take no actions which would jeopardize endangered species or their critical habitats should be granted. Stipulates that such an exemption may be granted only after a public hearing and finding that the benefits of the agency action outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action consistent with preserving the species or its critical habitat. States that no final determination of the Committee regarding such an exemption shall be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. Provides for judicial review of any Committee action with regard to an exemption."
