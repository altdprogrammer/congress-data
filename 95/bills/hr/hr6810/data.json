    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #232 (243-94)) Intergovernmental Antirecession Assistance Act - Amends the Public Works Employment Act of 1976 to authorize appropriations for five quarters (beginning with the calendar quarter which begins on July 1, 1977) to the States and local governments to coordinate budget-related actions by such governments with Federal Government efforts to stimulate economic recovery. Limits the total authorization under this Act to $2,250,000,000. Changes the method of computing the percentage of authorized funds that must be allocated to the States. Deems Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands to be States for the purpose of this Act. Changes the State and local revenue sharing amounts. Forbids, with certain limited exceptions, any State or local government receiving funds under this Act from excluding any person from participation in any program on the basis of race, sex, age (under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975), or physical handicap (under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). Provides for an investigation to determine whether other methods of allocation under the Public Works Employment Act of 1976 would be more precisely related to true economic conditions by the use of data on aggregate declines in private real wages and other factors. Sets aside an amount equal to one percent of the allocated funds for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands."
