Title II: Revision of Health Planning Authority - Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to review annually the national guidelines for health planning promulgated under the Act. Requires the Secretary to determine whether health care delivery systems are meeting the standards and goals set forth in such guidelines and to periodically publish his findings. Directs health systems agencies designated under Title XV to provide such data as will enable the Secretary to carry out his responsibilities. Adds to the list of subjects deserving priority consideration in the formulation of national health planning goals: (1) the discontinuance of duplicative or unneeded services and facilities; and (2) the adoption of policies to contain the rise of health care costs and promote efficiency in the health care delivery system. Directs the Secretary, in considering the application of an organization for designation as an area health systems agency, to give priority to an application which has been recommended by a Governor of a State within the area served by such agency for approval. Permits the State in which an agency is located an opportunity to comment on the performance of such agency before renewal by the Secretary of designating the agency as the health systems agency for a specified area. Authorizes the Secretary to limit the functions an agency may perform if the Secretary determines that such agency has not fulfilled its obligations. Sets forth new criteria for the determination by the Secretary of the amount of the grant to be made each fiscal year to each health systems agency for the operation of such agency. Stipulates that funds provided under grants to a health systems agency for specified purposes in a fiscal year which have not been expended during such year, shall remain available for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year provided the designation of such health systems agency remains in effect during such succeeding year. Sets forth membership and selection requirements for the governing body of a health systems agency. Provides that records and meetings except for personnel matters shall be available to the public. States that each health systems agency shall have an identificable program of providing assistance to the members of a governing body in making decisions for the agency. Prohibits any member of a governing body of a health systems agency from voting on any matter with which such member has any substantial ownership, employment, fiduciary, contractual, creditor, or consultative relationship. Requires that each State health planning and development agency consult with the Statewide Health Coordinating Council to determine statewide health needs. Requires that each health planning and development agency conduct a public hearing on the proposed Annual Implementation Plan and shall give interested persons an opportunity to submit their views orally and in writing. Enumerates the requirements of a certificate of need program established by a State health planning and development agency (State Agency). States that such programs shall provide controls on the acquisition of additional equipment and facilities including: (1) review and determination of need for major medical equipment, health care facilities, and capital expenditures; (2) the acquisition and development of only such equipment, facilities, and services as the State Agency determines are needed; and (3) annual review of acquisition programs. Requires each health systems agency to coordinate its activities with any State entity which reviews rates and budgets of health care facilities. Requires health systems agencies located within the same standard metropolitan statistical area to coordinate their activities. Extends through fiscal year 1982 authorizations for: (1) planning grants; (2) State health planning and development; (3) rate regulation; (4) centers for Health Planning; and (5) area health services development funds. Title III: Revision of Authority for Health Resources Development - Amends Title XVI (Health Resources Development) of the Public Health Service Act to allow the Secretary to make loans for: (1) modernization of medical facilities; (2) construction of new outpatient facilities; (3) construction of new inpatient facilities in areas determined to require additional facilities; and (4) conversion of existing medical facilities for the provision of new health services. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee payment of principal and interest to: (1) non-Federal lenders for their loans to nonprofit private entities for medical facilities projects; and (2) the Federal Financing Bank for its loans to nonprofit private entities for such projects. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for construction or modernization projects designed to: (1) eliminate or prevent imminent safety hazards; or (2) avoid noncompliance with State or voluntary licensure or accreditation standards. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public and nonprofit entities for projects for: (1) construction of outpatient medical facilities providing services for medically underserved populations; and (2) conversion of existing medical facilities to provide such services. Directs the Secretary to assure, by regulation, the effective execution and management of projects carried out under this Act."
