    "text": "Congregate Services Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into contracts with public housing agencies for the establishment of congregate housing projects which are supplemented by supportive services for frail and physically impaired residents. Requires assisted public housing authorities to maintain any financial effort they were making in furtherance of congregate services prior to contract authority approval, unless the Secretary waives such requirement. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to permit the provision of congregate services in existing public housing. Makes provisions for the administration of services and requires assisted public housing agencies to employ elderly and physically disabled residents to the maximum extent practicable. Sets forth application procedures, requirements for eligibility for services, and rules for the setting of fees for congregate services. Directs assisted public housing agencies to review this program with eligible residents and with the professional assessment committee within the 12 months period prior to the submission of an application for renewed funding."
