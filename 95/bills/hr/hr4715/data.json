    "text": "Ocean Dumping Amendments Act -- Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize the issuance of interim permits through December 31, 1981, for ocean dumping without regard to preexisting criteria. Limits such interim authorizations to persons already engaged in dumping of similar materials prior to the enactment of the Act, and where such person has no feasible alternative for disposal other than ocean dumping. Stipulates that such interim permits shall be reviewable on an annual basis. Requires that holders of interim permits expend adequate funds for research into alternate methods of material disposal, subject to conditions specified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protections Agency. Requires applicants for permits to pay a processing fee for administrative costs directly incurred in the processing of permits. Directs the Administrator to conduct studies to reduce or eliminate the dumping of radiological, chemical, or biological warfare agents or high-level radioactive wastes into ocean waters. Repeals various authorities of the Secretary of Commerce with respect to evaluation of substantive programs of other agencies."
