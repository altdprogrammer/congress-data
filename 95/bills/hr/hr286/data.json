Reduces the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed upon a Federal employee or officer for willfully intercepting, endeavoring to intercept, or procuring any other person to intercept any wire or oral communication except as authorized under specified provisions. Repeals the authority of the President to intercept communications for purposes of national security and the admissibility as evidence of the contents of communications so intercepted. Repeals the authority of specially designated State and local law enforcement officers to intercept communications without prior court approval for purposes of national security or with respect to conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime. Revises reporting requirements relative to intercepted wire or oral communications. Specifies reporting requirements relative to warrants authorizing the opening of mail."
