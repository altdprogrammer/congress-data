    "text": "Establishes an 11 member Commission on the Humane Treatment of Animals to study the treatment of animals. Requires that the membership include zoologists, veterinarians, and representatives from humane societies. Requires the Commission to determine if animals are caused needless pain or suffering as a result of their treatment: (1) on farms; (2) in zoos; (3) in laboratory experimentation; and (4) in other situations. Excludes from the study, to treatment of animals occurring in connection with the exercise of any religion. Directs the Commission to report its findings to the Congress and the President within two years after its last member is appointed. Terminates the Commission 60 days after it submits its final report. Authorizes appropriations of $750,000 per year to carry out the provisions of this Act."
