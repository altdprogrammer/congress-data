Decreases such rates on employers', employees', and self-employment income for the purposes of the Hospital Insurance Program. Amends such Title II to increase allocations of employment income and decrease allocations of self- employment income from the Treasury to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Extends allocation percentages through and past the year 2009. Repeals the yearly increases in the contribution and benefit base enacted by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 for purposes of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. Permits mutual borrowing by the Federal Old-Age, Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to insure prompt payment of benefits and the full operation of such Fund."
