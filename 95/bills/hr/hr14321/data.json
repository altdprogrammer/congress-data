Limits the amount of such deduction to five percent of the individual's compensation for the taxable year or $500, whichever is less. Increases the adjusted gross income limitation on the tax credit for the elderly, increases the allowable amount of such credit, and provides an annual cost-of-living adjustment for the credit."
