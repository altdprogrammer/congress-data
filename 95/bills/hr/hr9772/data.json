Requires the Government to find and offer to any such displaced farmland owner an option to buy suitable replacement property in lieu of other compensation for land taken under the Act. Requires any person displaced from any business or farm operation he or she owns to be compensated for closing costs and increased interest costs incurred in replacing such property. Requires 50 percent of the compensation offered by the Government to any owner under the Act to be paid to such owner pending any condemnation proceeding if the only issue in such proceeding is the adequacy of the compensation offered."
