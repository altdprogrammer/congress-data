Stipulates that during the period ending September 30, 1985, the revenues attributable to the special motor fuels and gasoline use in motorboats taxes under the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 shall be covered into the Fund. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to States from the Fund for State boating purposes. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall not exceed 50 percent of its cost. Sets forth conditions of eligibility for State boating safety projects and ratios for the allocation of Fund revenues among the States. Stipulates that the National Boating Safety Advisory Council shall act as an advisory body to the Secretary in assessing the need for and suitability of recreational boating facilities and boating safety services projects and in developing priorities for such facilities and projects. Directs the Secretary, within 18 months, to submit to Congress a comprehensive review and report on the needs, problems, and opportunities associated with recreational boating facilities and boating safety programs."
