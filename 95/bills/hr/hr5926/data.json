    "text": "Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Act - Allows an income tax credit for 30 percent of the expenditures not exceeding $750 which the taxpayer paid or incurred during the taxable year for installation of insulation or energy-conserving components which improve heating plant efficiency in his principal residence. Limits the application of this credit to expenditures paid or incurred for installations made between 1976 and 1982 in pre-existing dwellings. Reduces the allowable credit, on a graduated scale, for individuals with adjusted gross incomes greater than $10,000. Allows an income tax credit for 40 percent of the first $1,500, and a secondary credit for 25 percent of the next $7,600 paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year for the installation of qualified solar, wind and geothermal energy equipment in his principal residence. Allows an income tax credit for 20 percent of the first $1,500, and a secondary credit for 12.5 percent of the next $7,600 paid or incurred for the installation of wood stove, heat pump, or burner equipment in connection with new solar, wind or geothermal energy equipment which will be the principal source of space heat in the taxpayer's principal residence. Reduces these limitations in subsequent tax years by subtracting the amounts taken into account for these credits in previous tax years. Limits these credits to equipment installed between 1976 and 1982. Prorates each of the above credits for residential improvements among joint owners and cooperative shareholders according to their proportionate interests in the residential property. Provides for the carryover of any allowable credit which exceeds the taxpayer's current income tax liability. Reduces the allowable credits, on a graduated scale for and Conservation Act. persons with adjusted gross incomes greater than $15,000. Allows an investment tax credit for 25 percent of the qualified investment cost of depreciable geothermal, solar or wind energy equipment placed in service. Allows such a credit for 12 percent of the qualified costs of ventilation, heating, water and other components primarily designed to reduce the heat loss or gain of a structure, and origin ally used by the taxpayer. Prohibits these credits for property originally funded with Federal grants, or located in States which take these energy conserving measures into account for property assessment, or which don't enforce the thermal design requirements of the Energy Policy"
