    "text": "(Measure laid on table, S. 1019 passed in lieu) Maritime Appropriation Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts to the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1978 for: (1) vessel construction and rehabilitation; (2) the payment of obligations incurred for operating-differential subsidy; (3) research and development expenses; (4) reserve fleet expenses; (5) the Merchant Marine Academy; and (6) financial assistance to State marine schools. Requires American shipping lines receiving operating subsidies to cooperate with the Federal Maritime Commission's investigation of illegal rebating, and to certify that they are not paying any illegal rebates. Increases the subsistence allowance to students at the State Marine Schools from $600 to $1,200 per year. Amends the Merchant Marine Act to require annual authorization of appropriations for extension and correspondence courses offered by the Maritime Administration and for other operations and training expenses. Makes ferries operating in point-to-point transportation, weighing less than 75 tons, and which are capable of a sustained speed of not less than eight knots, eligible to receive loan guarantees of 87.5 percent, rather than the 75 percent currently available."
