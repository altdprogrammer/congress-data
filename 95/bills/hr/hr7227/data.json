    "text": "Public Assistance Amendments - Title I: Supplemental Security Income Program Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1964 to deny eligibility under such program to individuals receiving supplemental security income benefits through October 1, 1978. Amends Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income Program) of the Social Security Act to direct that in determining the income of an individual for purposes of the Supplemental Security Income Program there shall be excluded any amount received for the foster care of an individual who is not eligible for such benefits. Amends provisions of Title XVI requiring the payment of benefits directly to an institution or facility where an eligible individual is being treated, to allow the continued payment of benefits to the individual when such payment would be of significant therapeutic value and when there is substantial reason to believe that he or she would not misuse or improperly spend the funds involved. Continues payment of Title XVI benefits to individuals hospitalized outside the United States in specified cases. Terminates mandatory minimum State supplementation of Supplemental Security Income benefits under specified circumstances. Provides that computation of benefits shall be determined on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis. Provides for the payment to an individual who is in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility, of the full amount of such individual;s benefit during the first three months during which such individual is in a hospital, home, or facility. Sets forth the specific amounts to which an individual is entitled after the third month or when such individual is receiving payments under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Excludes from income, for purposes of benefit determinations, assistance furnished an individual by non-profit charitable institutions. Revises the definition of \"eligible spouse\" for purposes of Title XVI, to require that the couple not be separated for more than one month (presently six months). Requires that the Supplemental Security Income Program be coordinated with Medicaid and the food stamp program. Directs that in determining the eligibility and the amount of benefits for aliens under the Supplemental Security Income program the income of such individual's sponsor shall be attributed to the alien. Title II: Public Assistance Programs in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam Amends Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income Program), of the Social Security Act to extend such program to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. States that the benefits paid in each territory shall be in amounts proportionate to the ratio of the per capita income in each territory to the per capita income of the State having the lowest per capita. Amends Title XI (General Provisions) and Title XX (Grants to States for Services) to remove the ceiling on Federal matching funds for Aid to Families with Dependent Children in Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands. Title III: Social Services Program - Amends Title XX (Grants to States for Services) to increase the ceiling on Federal social services funding. Extends the period during which payment may be made for specified child day care services under title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and Title XX of the Social Security Act without regard to new staffing standards imposed by Title XX. Title IV: Child-Welfare Services Program - Amends Title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act to revise procedures for the payment to States for child-welfare service programs. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish a national and regional adoption information system to assist in the location of children in need of adoption and in the placement in adoptive homes of children awaiting adoption. Amends Title IV of the Social Security Act to prohibit payment to any State unless that State has in effect an action plan to assure foster care protection. Title V: Aid to Families with Dependent Children - Amends Title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act to require the States receiving payments under Title IV, to make subsidy payments to parents who adopt a child qualifying on the basis of special need."
