    "text": "Regulation of Lobbying Act - Requires any organization which expends $2,500 or more for other than travel expenses in any calendar quarter to retain a lobbyist to influence any Member of Congress with respect to any issue before Congress, or which makes 12 or more oral communications with a Member of Congress to so influence such Member to register with the Comptroller General not later than 15 days after engaging in such communications. Requires such registration statement to include the identification of the ten largest contributing organizations or individuals if the amount of income from such organization or individual was $2,500 or more and such income was greater than one percent of the total dues and contributions received by the reporting organization. Requires such organizations to file quarterly statements disclosing expenditures for a reception, dinner, or similar event for a Member, officer, or employee of Congress where the total cost of such event exceeds $500, a general description of the issues which are the subject of any congressional communication by a lobbyist retained by such organization, and the amount paid to any lobbyist during the quarter. Requires an organization required to register under this Act by reason of having made 12 or more congressional communications itself, to identify the issues which were the subject of such communications and estimate the expenditures, other than for salaries and wages, made by the organization during the quarter in connection with such issues. Authorizes the Comptroller General to require or request any information he considers necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to make public reports filed with him pursuant to this Act. Directs the Comptroller General, upon petition of any individual or organization, to withhold from publication information which may reasonably be expected to lead to the harassment of any individual or organization or lead to threats or reprisals against any individual or organization. Requires the Comptroller General to issue advisory opinions upon the request of any individual or organization. States that such opinions shall be made public and that acts done in good faith reliance on such opinions shall be presumed to be in compliance with this Act. Gives the Comptroller General informal powers to enforce this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General, in the event such informal actions fail, to institute a civil action to enforce this Act. Sets civil penalties for violations of this Act."
