Requires that each report accompanying any bill or resolution which provides for Federal information authority to contain specified information regarding the authority involved including its cost, the number of respondents involved, and the purpose for which the information is being collected. Requires the Bureau of the Census, upon request, to provide Congress with information regarding the evaluation of any existing or proposed Federal statistical authority or information which would be appropriate for the formation or evaluation of the estimates required to be included in committee reports pursuant to this Act."
