    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1797) Surface Transportation Assistance Act - =Title I: Federal-Aid Highway Act= - Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to revise and extend the authorization for appropriations for the Interstate Highway System through fiscal year 1990. Prohibits the use of interstate construction funds apportioned to a State to expand or clear areas adjacent to Interstate routes designed prior to February, 1967. Specifies the method by which the Secretary of Transportation is to apportion interstate highway funds for fiscal year 1980. Authorizes appropriations for various highway programs through fiscal year 1982. Authorizes appropriations for the resurfacing of lanes in the Interstate system which have been in use for more than five years. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall not exceed 70 percent of its cost. Establishes a cutoff date for the designation and completion of the Interstate Highway System. Prohibits the construction of any portions of the Interstate Highway System for which no environmental impact statement is filed by September 30, 1983. Provides that States will not be required to refund to the Fund, upon the withdrawal of routes, sums received by the State for certain costs. Authorizes a State to transfer up to 50 percent of its primary, urban or secondary highway program apportionment from one of these programs to another. Requires the Secretary to submit monthly reports to Congress regarding the obligations and expenditures for highway programs. Directs State highway departments to give consideration in the development of highway programs to projects providing direct access to new communities. Specifies the standards the Secretary shall use in determining whether any right-of-way on any Federal-aid system should be used by any utility. Permits the continued operation of State-owned service stations on Interstate highways. Provides that any funds not obligated by a State within a prescribed time period will lapse and go into a pool. Makes such pool of funds available to any State which has used up its regular apportionment and has projects ready to commence. Requires each State to establish a program for the restoration of certain Interstate highways in use for more than five years. Authorizes the Secretary to approve funding out of the Highway Trust Fund for such programs according to a specified formula. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for traffic control signalization projects designed to conserve motor fuel and decrease traffic congestion. Permits the Secretary to advance to any State 100 percent of the cost of construction of a toll bridge, tunnel, or approach if it is necessary to complete an essential gap in the Interstate System. Requires the State to repay such advance in later years. Stipulates that Federal financial assistance for emergency repairs and reconstruction of roads on the Federal-aid system shall be entirely funded from the Highway Trust Fund. Permits States to utilize funds for Federal-aid systems other than Interstate highways to study whether a privately owned toll bridge should be acquired by the State or a political subdivision. Allows nonprofit organizations to advertise free coffee for highway travelers. Requires just compensation be paid upon the removal of lawfully erected, but now prohibited, outdoor advertising signs. Allows the use of electronic signs to provide public service information or to advertise activities on the premises along Interstate highways. Requires each State to annually report to the Secretary regarding State enforcement of its vehicle weight limitations on the Federal-aid system. Authorizes the Secretary to approve Federal participation in State projects for replacing unsafe highway bridges which are not on the Federal-aid system. Authorizes appropriations for such projects. Authorizes a State to use between 15 and 35 percent of such funds to repair or replace highway bridges which are not on any Federal-aid system.
