Requires the President to make his nomination from such list. Prohibits the selection of any person who, within three years immediately preceding such appointment, has been employed by, received substantial profits, fees, or wages from, or represented in a professional capacity, any industry or organization regulated by or directly affected by any regulatory agency. Prohibits the reappointment of any such person to a second term in such position. Limits for a period of two years after service as a member or commissioner of such agency the activities of such person as an employee or representative of any such organization affected by the activities of the regulatory agency on which such person served. Requires members of the Nominating Board to file annual financial disclosure statements with the Comptroller General who shall maintain such statements as public records."
