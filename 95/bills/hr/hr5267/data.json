Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to: (1) establish vessel traffic systems; (2) establish on-share traffic monitoring systems; (3) control vessel traffic for waters subject to congested traffic through specified means; (4) require that specified navigation equipment be on board tankers; (5) require vessels over 20,000 deadweight tons to be equipped with a segregated ballast capacity; (6) require tankers entering United States ports to be annually inspected; and (7) require all tankers to be manned by personnel licensed in accordance with Coast Guard standards or equivalent foreign standards. Prohibits vessels carrying hazardous cargo in bulk from entering a United States port until a certificate of inspection has been issued to such vessel indicating that such vessel is in compliance with the provisions of this Act and any rules and regulations established pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to undertake a study of the construction, equipment, and systems aids requirements for all classes of commercial vessels operating within the navigable waters of the United States or the fishery conservation zone and to report the results of such study to the Congress within one year. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
