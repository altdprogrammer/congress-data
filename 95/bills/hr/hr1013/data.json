Requires that such a broadcasting station include locally produced foreign language subtitles in programs of local origin when such determination reveals that five percent or more of the residents in the station's grade A coverage area utilize any language other than English as their primary spoken language. Provides that compliance with this requirement shall be taken into account in broadcast license renewals."
