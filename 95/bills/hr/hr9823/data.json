Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish and enforce standards for construction and operation of all Federal repositories. Requires the Commission to hold public hearings in each State which has jurisdiction of any property within 25 miles of the site of the proposed repository and to consult with the Governors of such States. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to grant the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing and regulatory authority regarding Federal repositories. Requires the transfer of military radioactive waste to Federal repositories. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to restore the background radiation at abandoned uranium mill sites or mines as designated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to levels which approximate those levels which existed before operations commenced at such sites. Authorizes States to exercise concurrent authority regarding radioactive waste storage if the State requirements impose additional or more stringent standards for the construction or operation of such facilities."
