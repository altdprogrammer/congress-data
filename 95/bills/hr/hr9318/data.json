Requires a participating State to agree to enroll any individual who elects to participate in an approved State plan in lieu of Medicare and to credit against any premiums such individual pays under the State plan any premiums the individual paid under Medicare during the one year period of election. Authorizes the Secretary to agree to transfer on a quarterly basis to a State those funds which the Secretary would otherwise pay to the State under its plan approved under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act and requires the State to enroll each individual in a plan which provides the same level of medical assistance as provided under the State's Medicaid plan. Prohibits any individual who elects to receive medical assistance under an approved State plan from receiving medical assistance under the Medicare or Medicaid programs during the one year period of election."
