    "text": "Grants to the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service, under the United States Grain Standards Act, discretion as to the subjects and processes about which he shall require appropriate agencies and persons to maintain complete and accurate records with respect to the official inspection and official weighing of grain. Repeals the requirement that the State and other official and State agencies designated to perform inspection or weighing functions pay fees to the Administrator to cover the costs of the direct supervision of personnel of such agencies by the field office personnel of the Federal Grain Inspection Service. Authorizes appropriations to cover such costs. Establishes a 12 member advisory committee to advise the Administrator with respect to the implementation of the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976. Requires such committee to terminate 18 months after the enactment of this Act. Makes numerous technical amendments to the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended by the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976, including: (1) deleting the general exception to the provision limiting the number of official agencies for inspection or weighing to one for any geographic area; (2) authorizing the Administrator to make exceptions to the general prohibition against the official inspection of grain samples not physically located within the geographical area assigned to an official agency; and (3) limiting the performance of appeal weighing to employees of the Federal Grain Inspection Service. Prohibits any person from knowingly making any false representation that any weighing service under the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended, has been performed with respect to grain. Prohibits any person acting under a license or authorization to perform official functions under the United States Grain Standards Act from certifying or stating in writing or performing any analysis to determine: (1) the subclass of Hard Red Winter wheat on the basis of color or on the basis of the dark, hard, and vitreous kernel content; or (2) the percentage of dark, hard, and vitreous kernels in Hard Red Winter Wheat."
