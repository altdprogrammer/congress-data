Specifies exceptions including charitable, educational, or nonprofit institutions, and farmer-owned and controlled cooperatives. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire at fair market value any property or interest of which a person is required to divest himself under the provisions of this Act, if the person is otherwise unable to divest himself of such property."
