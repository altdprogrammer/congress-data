Empowers the Postal Service to order a person whom it determines is conducting a lottery by mail or is obtaining money or property through the mail by means of false pretenses to (1) offer to return upon written request, money or property received by such conduct, (2) return such money or property within 21 days after receiving such an order, and (3) provide the Postal Service a list of persons from whom money or property was received, a list of persons who have requested the return of money or property, and a statement indicating the persons to whom money and property has been returned. Specifies civil penalties for persons who fail to maintain such records as may be necessary to comply with such orders."
