    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1613) Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to make resources available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in an amount not greater than 1,450 million Special Drawing Rights for United States participation in the Supplementary Financing Facility. Requires the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to cover any loss or receive any gain in the United States monetary assets arising from such participation in the facility and fluctuation in the dollar value. Limits the authority of the Secretary to enter into agreements making resources available for United States participation in the Facility to such amounts appropriated in advance. Authorizes appropriations not to exceed an equivalent of 1,450 million Special Drawing Rights, effective October 1, 1978, to the Secretary for such participation. Stipulates that compensation to the United States executive director to the Fund shall be at a rate not in excess of that provided for level IV of the Executive Schedule, and compensation to the United States alternative executive director to the Fund shall be at a rate not in excess of that provided for level V of the Executive Schedule. States that the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States executive director to the Fund to present to the Fund's Executive Board a comprehensive set of salary reform proposals to assure that salaries of fund employees are comparable to salaries in national government service or private industry. Directs the Secretary to instruct the United States Executive Director of the IMF to: (1) seek to assure that no decision by the IMF of the use of the Supplementary Financing Facility undermines or departs from the United States policy regarding the comparability of treatment of public and private creditors in cases of debt rescheduling where official United States credits are indirect; and (2) to initiate a wide consultation with the managing director of the Fund and other member country executive directors with regard to encouraging the staff of the Fund to formulate stabilization programs entered into pursuant to loans from the Supplementary Financing Facility which, to the maximum feasible extent, foster a broader base of productive investment and employment, especially in those productive activities which are designed to meet basic human needs. Requires the United States Governor of the Fund to report annually to Congress, evaluating, with respect to countries to which loans are made by the Supplementary Financing Facility, the effects of policies of such countries which result from the standby agreements on basic human needs in such countries. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to report annually to the Congress on the status of internationally recognized human rights in each country which draws on funds made available under the Facility of the IMF. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States Government should disassociate itself from any foreign government which engages in the international crime of genocide. Prohibits any corporation, institution, group, or individual from importing into the United States or its territories and possessions any article grown, produced, or manufactured in Uganda. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to prohibit the exportation to Uganda of any article, supply, and technical data and information (other than grains or food products) by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, until the President determines and certifies to Congress that the Government of Uganda is no longer committing a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. Directs the President to encourage international support of such restrictions. Requires the Secretary to instruct the Executive Director of the United States to the IMF to work in opposition to the extension of financial or technical assistance by the Facility or agency thereof to any country which permits entry into such country or encourages, supports, or harbors any person who has committed an act of international terrorism or fails to prevent any such person from committing such an act outside its territory. States that beginning with fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays of the Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts."
