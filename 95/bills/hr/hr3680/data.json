    "text": "Elementary and Secondary Career Education Act - Establishes a career education program for elementary and secondary schools to increase the emphasis such institutions place upon career awareness, exploration, decisionmaking, and planning. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out provisions of this Act for the next five fiscal years. Directs the Commissioner of Education to allot to each State an amount which bears the same ratio to the appropriated sums as such State's population, aged five to eighteen, bears to the total population, aged five to eighteen, of all the States. Stipulates that no State shall be allotted from such sums less than $100,000. Directs the Commissioner to allocate for each fiscal year an amount equal to three percent of the sums appropriated for that year to make grants to local educational agencies located in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Sets forth procedures for applying to the Commissioner for receiving such funds. Requires that an application contain specified assurances, including assurances that: (1) the State educational agency will be the agency responsible for planning the use and administering the expenditure of funds received under this Act; (2) the State educational agency or State Board of Education will adopt a statement of policy that career education is of prime importance in elementary and secondary schooling within the State; and (3) the State legislature and Governor have been notified of the State's application for such funds. Details the use of funds by the States which are permissible, including: (1) conducting inservice institutes for educational personnel; (2) training local career education coordinators; (3) collecting, evaluating, and disseminating career education materials; and (4) coordinating career education activities with other State and private agencies. Designates the Office of Career Education to be the administering agency within the Office of Education for the review of State plans, applications, and reports submitted pursuant to this Act. Provides that the Office of Career Education shall perform a national leadership role in furthering the purposes of career education. Directs the National Institute of Education to continue its complementary efforts in career education and calls for coordination between the Institute and the Office of Career Education in (1) identifying research and development priorities and (2) disseminating the products and findings of research and development undertaken by the Institute."
