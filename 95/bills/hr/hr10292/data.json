Permits participants of employee benefit plans which offer benefits only in the form of a lump sum to make binding election at the time of retirement to purchase periodic payment annuities, and requires plans to provide lump sum amounts to persons selecting which will enable them to purchase annuities paying equal periodic benefits to similarly situated females and males."
