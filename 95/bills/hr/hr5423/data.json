    "text": "Amends the Health Revenue Sharing and Health Services Act to permit the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants and loans for the initial costs of establishing and operating home health agencies and for expansion of their services. Permits the Secretary to make grants to educational institutions and other public and nonprofit private entities for programs for the training of guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, geriatric specialists, and other home health services personnel. Authorizes the appropriation of specified amounts for fiscal year 1977 for the purpose of making such grants. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to include within its medical coverage: (1) preventive health care, including an annual comprehensive physical examination of older individuals, and diagnostic services; (2) hearing aids, foot care, dental care, and vision aids (including hearing and vision examinations for older individuals); (3) care and services provided by outpatient clinics for the elderly; (4) nutritional counseling; (5) professional guidance and counseling for aged and disabled individuals living alone at home; (6) periodic chore services; and (7) hospital outreach services. Revises such Act to require State comprehensive medical plans to include provisions for intermediate care facility services. Charges the Professional Standards Review Organization with the same responsibility for review of health care services in the case of skilled nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and other long-term care providers as now required with respect to hospitals. Permits the Secretary to make grants to States to assist them in funding specified demonstration and pilot projects to determine the effectiveness of various home health and supportive services. Permits the Secretary to make grants to political subdivisions of States to enable them to conduct annual health fairs through which individuals over age 60 would be provided free medical checkups. Authorizes the Secretary to make demonstration grants to help meet the cost of establishing and operating private nonprofit entities to provide community care to persons over age 65. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to political subdivisions of States to enable them to establish and operate programs to provide mobile health facilities to persons over age 60. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that a minimum of $20,000,000 be obligated for grants and contracts for emergency medical services systems for the elderly."
