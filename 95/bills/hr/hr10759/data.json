    "text": "National Health Protection Act - Title I: Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Protection - Provides that an eligible child (an individual from birth to the age of six) who is enrolled with a participating provider (any provider of health care services who has entered into an agreement with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Secretary) to provide health care services to eligible persons) is entitled to receive from that provider to all health care services related to the diagnosis and treatment of any disease, injury, or disability, as well as any other health care services necessary for the adequate protection, maintenance, or restoration of his mental and physical health. Provides that any eligible woman (every woman residing in the United States who is a legal resident or citizen or the spouse of a legal resident or citizen of the United States) enrolled with a participating provider is entitled to receive from that provider, either directly or indirectly, all health care services related to: (1) the diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy; (2) the diagnosis and treatment of disease or injury during pregnancy which could threaten the healthy development of the unborn child; or (3) any injury, disability, or disease relating to or resulting from pregnancy that occurs during the period of 12 weeks immediately following the termination of a pregnancy, including health care services for the mental and physical well-being of the woman. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments to participating providers by the capitation method, consisting of one annual payment per eligible individual enrolled with a provider. Requires the Secretary to assist in the formation of insurance methods to protect providers against catastrophic costs they may incur. Establishes the National Maternal and Child Health Protection Advisory Council (Council) to: (1) advise the Secretary on matters of general policy in the administration of this Title and in the formulation of regulations; and (2) study the operation of this Title, the utilization of health care services under it, and the relationship of such utilization and payment under this Title to payment under other Acts, with a view to recommending any changes in the provisions or administration of this Title or other Acts which may appear desirable. Requires the Council to make an annual report to the Secretary on the performance of its functions. Requires the Secretary to consult with State health planning and development agencies and health systems agencies, as defined in the Public Health Service Act, to coordinate the administration of this Title with related State and local activities. Title II: Catastrophic Protection Tax Credit - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow as a credit against the personal income tax an amount related to the amount of medical expenses not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. Repeals existing tax deductions under such Code for medical and dental expenses. Title III: Expansion of Medicare Program - Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to include in the definition of medical and other health services certain prosthetic devices, drugs, biologicals, eye examinations, eyeglasses, hearing aids and dentures. Reduces the inpatient hospital deduction under the Medicare program to $50."
