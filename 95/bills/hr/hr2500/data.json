Authorizes the President to order transfers of supplies of interstate natural gas from one pipeline to another or order the construction and operation of additional facilities, to alleviate natural gas shortages. Stipulates that no such delivery or transportation may continue after April 30, 1977. Stipulates that such transfers as ordered by the President shall not subject the pipeline to regulation under the Natural Gas Act or other provisions of State or Federal law. Establishes procedures for enforcement of orders issued under this Act. Establishes criteria for compensation of pipelines for compliance with such orders. Exempts activities pursuant to this Act from the antitrust law. Authorizes the President to require contracts for purchases of emergency supplies of natural gas before August 1, 1977. Stipulates that such transactions shall be exempt from Federal Power Commission regulation under the Natural Gas Act. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for violations of orders issued under this Act."
