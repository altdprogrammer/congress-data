Requires immediate reporting of any discharges to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, who shall monitor and analyze such discharges. Stipulates that such Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce shall enforce the provisions of this title. Imposes a civil penalty of not more than $100,000 for each violation of the provisions of this Act. Imposes an additional penalty of up to $100,000 or five years imprisonment or both for knowing violation of the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. Authorizes civil suits by private parties to enforce provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary of State to seek effective international cooperation to prohibit the discharge of fuel oils and petroleum products into the oceanic waters and high seas of the United States. Title II: Comprehensive Research on Discharging of Fuel - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish criteria for determining the impact of such discharges on human health, animal and plant life, and marine ecosystems."
