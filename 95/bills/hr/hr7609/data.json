Directs the Attorney General to review on a periodic basis the recommendations of the Commission and to adjust the status of such aliens upon a finding that: (1) the aliens can be admitted under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and (2) the adjustment would not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed United States citizens."
