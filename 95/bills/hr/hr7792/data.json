    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1195) Franked Mail Act - Extends from 28 to 60 days the period of time before an election during which a Member or Member-elect of Congress may not, consistent with the policy of Congress, use his or her mail franking privileges if such Member is a candidate for re-election in such election or election to any other public office. Declares that the use of such franking privilege for mass mailing outside of a Member's or Member-elect's home district is not within the policy of Congress if such person is a candidate for any other office. Limits the total number of pieces of franked mass mail which Senators and Senators-elect can send in any calendar year. Provides that when determining the total number of pieces of mass mail, two pieces of third class mail will be counted the same as one piece of first class mail, and for less densely populated States, three pieces of third class mail will equal one piece of first class mail. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to certify annually the number of residents over the age of 18 and the population density of each State. Authorizes Senators or Senators-elect to address franked mailings in any form authorized for use by the general public. Requires franked mail to be sent by the most economical means. Requires Senators annually to register mass mailings in accordance with Senate rules. Limits the number of pieces of franked mail sent to six times the number of addresses to which such mail may be delivered under existing law. Requires Members or Members-elect of the House of Representatives to submit mail, which is intended to be sent as franked mail under provisions allowing a simplified form of address, to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards for an advisory opinion as to whether such proposed mailing is in compliance with such provisions. Expands the authority of the Commission to cover advisory opinions involving any non-criminal law regarding franked mail. Increases to 90 days (now 30 days) the time period for former Congressmen to use the frank to send seed and agricultural reports, or to send or receive public documents. Extends the franking privilege of the surviving spouse of a Member of Congress who dies in office to surviving relatives in the event there is no surviving spouse (such privilege covers only mail relating to the death of such Member mailed within 180 days of death). Prohibits sending under the frank (1) mail matter that is purely personal to the sender or to any other person and is unrelated to official business, or (2) mass mailings which are laudatory of a Member on the basis of performance of official duties. Authorizes the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards to issue regulations or investigate franking privilege violations in connection with any other Federal law (other than criminal statutes) or in connection with any rule of the House relating to franked mail. Extends the Commission's jurisdiction over franking violations to include complaints against former Members and officers of the House. Permits the Japan-United States Friendship Commission to use penalty mail in conducting its business."
