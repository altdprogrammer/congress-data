Defines qualified improvements as storm windows, insulation, heat exchangers, ducting or other items certified by the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration as achieving a significant reduction in a building's heating or cooling loss, or which is designed and capable of improving a heating plant's efficiency. Limits the credit to expenses paid or incurred between enactment and January 1, 1979. Provides that the maximum credit allowed for expenses incurred by a subchapter S corporation, controlled groups, and trusts or estates shall be proportionately divided between entity, the owners, or the members or the beneficiaries as the case may be. Provides for a reduction in a building's basis in the same amounted as the credit taken."
