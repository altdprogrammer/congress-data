Sets requirements for such grants, including the establishment of a management commission. Requires the Secretary to publish specified guidelines for the contents of such plan. Authorizes the Secretary, upon approval of the New Jersey plan, to establish the Pine Barrens National Ecological Reserve, to acquire lands within the reserve and to transfer such lands and other Federal lands to the State, and to make grants to the management commission for the acquisition of land in the reserve, compensation to landowners, and payments in lieu of taxes to local governments. Allows the Secretary to retain a reversionary right in such transferred lands and authorizes him to establish a federally-managed National Ecological Reserve upon the failure or nonsubmission of the plan. Requires the establishment of a Pinelands Citizens Advisory Committee, prior to approval of the State plan, to consult with the management commission established under such plan."
