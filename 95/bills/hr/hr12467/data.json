    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1780) Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments - =Title I: Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973= - Authorizes for basic State vocational rehabilitation services: (1) appropriations of $808,000,000 for fiscal year 1979, and (2) appropriations for fiscal years 1980, 1981, and 1982 in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, with specified ceilings. Changes the formula for the computation of State allotments for basic vocational services. Provides that State plans for such services need be submitted once every three years, instead of annually. Requires such plans to: (1) contain assurances that rehabilitation facilities comply with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968; (2) provide for authority to contract for on-the-job training with profitmaking organizations in certain instances; (3) provide for vocational rehabilitative services to handicapped American Indians; and (4) provide for the establishment and maintenance of information and referral programs so that the handicapped will be aware of the various Federal and State programs which would benefit them. Changes procedures for the withholding of State grants for failure of the State plan to comply with Federal requirements or for failure of the administration of the plan to comply with the plan's own requirements. Requires the directors of any State vocational rehabilitative agency to establish procedures for the review, upon the request of the handicapped individual, of determinations made by the rehabilitation counselor or coordinator. Allows State vocational rehabilitation services to include (1) the use of existing telecommunications systems which have the potential for improving service delivery methods and (2) the use of services providing recorded material for the blind and captioned material for the deaf.

Transfers responsibility for establishing and supporting research and training centers from the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration to the Institute. Authorizes the Institute to make grants for additional projects, including the use of existing telecommunications systems which have the potential for substantially improving delivery methods, research relating to the rehabilitation of handicapped children and of handicapped individuals aged 60 or older, and certain model research and demonstration projects. Revises the program of guarantees of loans for the construction of rehabilitation facilities. Authorizes the Commissioner to make training grants for medical, social, and psychological rehabilitation in addition to vocational rehabilitation.

Replaces the former Title IV of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 with a new Title IV \"National Council on the Handicapped\", which establishes within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare a National Council on the Handicapped. Sets forth the duties of the National Council, including establishing general policies for the National Institute of Handicapped Research and reviewing and evaluating on a continuing basis all policies, programs, and activities concerning handicapped individuals. Adds to the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board 11 members, to be appointed by the President from the general public, of whom five must be handicapped individuals.

Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to handicapped individuals to enable them to establish and operate their own businesses. =Title III: Comprehensive Services for Independent Living= - Adds to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 a new title: \"Title VII: Comprehensive Services for Independent Living.\" Authorizes, under such Title, the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration to make grants (supplementary to grants under Title I of the Act) to assist States in providing independent living services designed to meet the needs of individuals whose disabilities are so severe that they do not presently have the potential for gainful employment but may benefit from vocational rehabilitation services which will enable them to live and function independently. Includes under such authority grants to States for the provision of independent living services to older blind individuals. =Title IV: Special Studies and Miscellaneous Provisions= - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants and contracts for the purpose of research and demonstration projects specifically designed to address the multiple and interrelated service needs of handicapped individuals, the elderly, and children, youths, adults, and families.

Directs the Secretary to conduct studies of: (1) the impact of vocational rehabilitation services provided under the Rehabilitation Act on recipients of disability payments under certain provisions of the Social Security Act; (2) the special problems and needs of handicapped individuals who reside in rural areas; and (3) ways to structure Federal programs to eliminate disincentives for handicapped individuals receiving benefits to obtain and continue in employment. =Title V: Amendments to the Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Act= - Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act - Amends the Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Act to redefine \"developmental disability\" and to require the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit a special report to Congress concerning the impact of such modification.
