States that such rule, other than an emergency rule, shall not become effective if it is disapproved within 60 days by either House of Congress. Establishes, as a joint committee of Congress, the Joint Committee on Agency Rules. Makes it the responsibility of such committee to study agency rules promulgated on or after the effective date of this Act, and to report a resolution to Congress if such committee determines such a rule should be disapproved. Sets forth the membership and administrative procedure of such committee. Requires Federal agencies: (1) to give interested persons at least 60 days to participate in rulemaking procedures; and (2) at the request of any such person, to hold a public hearing on a proposed rule. Requires the Administrative Conference of the United States to study Congressional review of agency rulemaking under this Act, and to report its findings to Congress before October 1, 1983. Makes this Act effective on the first day of the first session of the 96th Congress."
