    "text": "Foreign Intelligence Electronic Surveillance Act - Title I: Electronic Surveillance Within the United States for Foreign Intelligence Purposes - Sets forth procedures for obtaining foreign intelligence information by means of electronic surveillance. States that electronic surveillance may be used for such purposes only upon: (1) the issuance of a surveillance certificate signed by the Attorney General and an assistant to the President for national security affairs who was confirmed by the Senate; and (2) in the case of electronic surveillance of a United States citizen, the issuance of a certificate signed by the President. Specifies information which must be present in a surveillance certificate. Sets forth procedures to minimize intrusion into the privacy of surveillance targets. Prescribes guidelines on the scope and duration of surveillance, the use of common communications carriers for such purpose, and the use of information obtained through surveillance. Authorizes civil suits by those (other than foreign agents) aggrieved by electronic surveillance conducted or disclosed other than in accordance with this Act. Title II: Conforming Amendments - Makes conforming amendments to title 18 of the United States Code. Title III: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective upon enactment, with a limited exception."
