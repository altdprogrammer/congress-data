    "text": "Federal Programs and Spending Control Act - Title I: Authorizations of Budget Authority - Terminates all new budget authority for any fiscal year beginning after October 1, 1981, except for trust funds in the United States Treasury. Prohibits the consideration of any new budget authority by either House of Congress for any Federal program for more than four years, unless a program control review of such program has been conducted, and in the case of programs in existence on the enactment date of this Act, unless such authority is for a period not exceeding the period for which the last budget authority was authorized. States that new programs may not be authorized for more than one fiscal year at the outset, two fiscal years the second time budget authority is given for such program, and unless a program control review has been conducted for such program. Prohibits the changing of any program funded from a trust fund or permanent budget authority after October 1, 1981, unless a program control review of such program has been conducted during the four year period preceeding the year in which the proposed change is to occur. Requires the Comptroller General to identify for the Congress which programs are funded from permanent budget authority. Title II: Early Elimination of Inactive and Duplicative Programs - Requires the Comptroller General to identify for Congress all inactive programs and programs with duplicate objectives by July 1, 1978. Title III: Program Control Review - Requires standing congressional committees to conduct a program control review of each program within its legislative jurisdiction at least every four years. Lists the contents of such review including: (1) the feasibility of alternate programs; (2) the impact of such program on the national economy; and (3) the possibility of eliminating such program. Requires each such committee to recommend whether new budget authority should be authorized for any such program. Requires that analyses and assistance in making such reviews be provided by the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Federal agency administering the program being reviewed. Title IV: Continuing Review and Evaluation - States that whenever the General Accounting Office discloses any substantial deficiency in achievement of the objectives of any Federal program it shall reaudit such program every six months until it determines that the deficiency or deficiencies have been eliminated. Requires that the President's budget list the specific objectives of any program therein comparing the objectives of the past year with those of the year covered by such budget. Title V: Disclosure on the Face of Bills and Joint Resolution of the Projected Costs and Savings of Actions Proposed Therein - Requires the printing of a note on each public or private bill or resolution estimating the direct and indirect costs and savings anticipated in carrying out the provisions of such bill or resolution in the fiscal year in which such legislation is introduced and the five fiscal years thereafter. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Stipulates that specified portions of this Act are enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the Senate and are subject to change in the same manner as any other rule of either House."
