Directs the President to formulate the criteria for determining the costs of compliance with Federal rules and regulations. Requires the head of each agency to use such criteria in conducting a study of the costs of compliance with rules and regulations set forth by the agency and to submit such report to the President, Congress, and the Comptroller General. Directs the Comptroller General to review such agency reports and to submit its findings to Congress. Requires the President to include regulatory budget recommendations in the Budget to Congress. Directs Congress to utilize such findings and recommendations in developing the regulatory budget for each agency. Sets forth the rules for consideration of any bill, resolution, or amendment that would cause the level of costs of compliance for any agency to exceed the maximum costs of compliance as established in the regulatory budget for that agency."
