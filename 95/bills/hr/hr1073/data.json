Limits the allowable tax credits per dependent, to $200, or 50 percent of the tuition paid for such education during the year, whichever is less, with a progressive decrease of this limitation for individuals who have an adjusted gross income that is greater than $18,000. Grants standing to taxpayers to commence suits in the District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of this Act."
