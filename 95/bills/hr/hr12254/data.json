    "text": "Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act - Title I: Tribally Controlled Community Colleges - Provides for educational grants by the Secretary of the Interior to tribally controlled Indian community colleges. Provides that schools eligible for such grants shall be: (1) formally controlled, sanctioned or chartered by an Indian tribe or tribes; (2) governed by a board of directors, a majority of whom are Indians; (3) directed by stated goals, philosophy, or plan of action aimed at meeting the needs of Indians; and (4) attended by students, a majority of whom must be Indians if the school has been in operation more than one year. Authorizes technical assistance to the schools. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to contract with the Assistant Secretary of Education of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for feasibility studies of individual schools. Requires such studies to be conducted by the Secretary of the Interior upon tribal request. Provides for the administration, and funding of these grants, with certain rule-making authority being vested in the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations of stated amounts for three years. Directs the Secretary to make annual reports and recommendations to Congress on the program. Stipulates that assistance under this Act shall not, in itself, prevent any recipient college from receiving other educational assistance. Directs the Secretary to prepare a report, on existing and planned tribally controlled community college facilities, Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities which could reasonably be converted to such use. Excludes the Navajo Tribe from the provisions of this title, as well as any colleges which limit enrollment to specific tribes. Title II: Construction Grants - Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress by November, 1979, a survey and study on the academic facilities required by tribally controlled community colleges. Authorizes the Secretary to make planning and construction grants to the colleges upon proper applications and showings. Excludes the Navajo Tribe, as well as any colleges which limit enrollment to specific tribes, from the provisions of this title. Title III: Navajo Community College - Navajo Community College Assistance Act - Amends the Navajo Community College Act to authorize construction appropriations of $60,000,000 for the College over the three years following this enactment. Appropriates additional operating and maintenance appropriations for the College. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish procedures to control such appropriations and to segregate them from appropriations for Navajo programs historically expended by the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
