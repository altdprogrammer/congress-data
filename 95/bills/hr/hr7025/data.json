    "text": "Ocean Shipping Act - Amends the Shipping Act, 1916, to include controlled carriers within the coverage of such Act. Defines a \"controlled carrier\" as a common carrier by water in foreign commerce owned by a government whose vessels are not afforded most-favored nation treatment and which offer services not covered by a service agreement under such Act or whose rates are not covered by a conference or rate agreement under such Act. Sets forth restrictions regarding the rates or rate structures which such carriers may maintain. Authorizes the Federal Maritime Commission to disapprove such rates or rate structures if it finds they are unreasonable. Requires that such rates or rate structures be filed with the Commission at least 30 days before their effective date. Authorizes the Commission to suspend such rates or structures pending an investigation regarding their reasonableness. Requires controlled carriers to designate and retain registered agents within the United States. Authorizes appropriations of $1,950,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
