    "text": "Mobile Source Emission Control Amendments - Amends the Clean Air Act to extend through model year 1979 interim standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions from light-duty motor vehicles. Specifies standards applicable in model years 1980 and afterwards for such pollutants. Revises the emission standard for carbon monoxide to allow emissions of up to 9.0 grams per vehicle mile. Extends until model year 1981 the current 2.0 grams per vehicle mile interim standard for nitrogen oxide emissions from light-duty vehicles. Establishes a nitrogen oxides emissions standard of 1.0 gram per vehicle mile for model years after 1981, subject to revision or waiver by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with prescribed procedures. Stipulates that such revisions and waivers shall not permit emissions in excess of the 2.0 grams per vehicle mile interim standard. Directs the Administrator, the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Energy Administration to submit separate reports to Congress regarding the consequences of such emission standards on fuel consumption. Establishes additional prohibitions and penalties for tampering with motor vehicle emission control equipment. Empowers limits in the amount of vehicle testing required of small manufacturers. Establishes procedures for review of instructions for high altitude performance adjustments for motor vehicle emission control systems by the Administrator in accordance with specified requirements. Revises warranty requirements stipulated by the Act. Specifies an 18-month or 18,000 mile warranty requirement for the useful life of motor vehicle emission control systems. Directs the Administrator to study the effects of emissions of sulfur-bearing conformed from motor vehicles and aircraft. Extends the exception for disclosure of confidential information in administrative and judicial proceedings to emission data upon a satisfactory showing to the Administrator that such data would divulge trade secrets. Requires that documentation, justifications, proposed drafts, and comments of other agencies an proposed motor vehicle emission standards be made available to the public once such standards are proposed. Establishes procedures for oral presentation of views, with opportunity for cross-examination, with respect to such standards. Authorizes direct review of alleged procedural errors in the appropriate court of appeals. Authorizes the appropriation of $200,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980, to carry out the purposes of this Act other than research, development, and demonstration activities."
