    "text": "Perishable Food Protection Act - Prohibits a strike or a lockout affecting a perishable food processing operation unless the union or employer gives written notice to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor at least 30 days prior to beginning such strike or lockout. Allows either the union, the employer, or any State Secretary of Agriculture to petition the Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor jointly to appoint an arbitrator. Makes the arbitrator's decision on all issues which are mandatory subjects of bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act final and binding upon all parties, except that the aggrieved party may appeal to a United States court of appeals. Allows a United States district court to enjoin any work stoppage occuring without the required 30 days notice."
