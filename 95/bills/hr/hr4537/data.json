Authorizes the Secretary to defer without penalty the 1977 and 1978 payments of any installment charges owned to the United States on Federal reclamation projects as he deems necessary because of financial hardship caused by extreme drought conditions. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress by March 1, 1978, on expenditures under this Act."
