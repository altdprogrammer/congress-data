Defines a \"nonnational flag carrier\" as a common carrier by water which operates vessels on regular berth services to and from United States ports and which are not documented under the laws of the United States or the other country involved. Authorizes the Federal Maritime Commission to reject rates not conforming with the provisions of this Act."
