    "text": "Makes any spouse surviving a civil service annuitant eligible for a survivor annuity if such surviving spouse was married to such annuitant for at least one year. States that as an annuitant's annuity is increased because of reemployment by the Government, such survivor's annuity may also be increased, and in such event, the principal annuity shall not be decreased to compensate for such survivor's increase. Makes all surviving spouses who are eligible for survivor's annuities before or after the enactment of this Act eligible for an annuity equal to 55 percent of the maximum annuity to which the principal annuitant was entitled at the time of retirement or separation plus any applicable cost-of-living adjustments."
