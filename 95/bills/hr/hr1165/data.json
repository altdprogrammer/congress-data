    "text": "Amends the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974 to direct the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to establish programs for the development and demonstration of solar thermal conversion systems in greenhouses, crop-drying facilities, live-stock shelters, and other nonresidential agricultural structures. Requires that at least 50 such demonstration projects be operated on family farms, as such term is defined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Authorizes the appropriation of $10,000,000 over a three-year period for fiscal years 1977 through 1979 to carry out such program. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study of the Nation's agricultural energy requirements to assist in the administration of the solar energy demonstration program authorized by this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a central research information exchange center to disseminate information on agricultural applications of solar thermal conversion technology."
