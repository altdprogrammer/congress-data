Requires, in the case of executive agreements the disclosure of which would hamper national security, that such agreements be submitted by the Secretary to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives under a written injunction of secrecy. States that such an agreement shall be available for inspection only by Members of Congress."
