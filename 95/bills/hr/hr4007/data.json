Rept. 95-956) Allows certain New York City pension plans to retain their tax-exempt status, until 1982, under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, even though they purchase debt obligations issued by or for the city of New York. Permits participating pension plans to acquire city or agency obligations if the agreement is not disapproved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Stipulates the factors to be taken into account by the Secretary, including: (1) the amount of debt obligations that a plan may acquire; (2) the terms of the obligations to be acquired; (3) the assurances of significant participation by the State or private sources; (4) the progress being made by the city towards a balanced budget; (5) the fact that an acquisition might result in the plan having a negative cash flow in the fiscal year of acquisition; and (6) the necessary reports and audits being submitted by the plans and the city. Amend the Social Security Act to provide for continued Federal matching funds for child support collection and paternity establishment services to non-AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) families on a permanent basis."
