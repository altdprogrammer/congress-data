Title II: International Sugar Agreement - Authorizes the President to limit the importation of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization, and to otherwise regulate foreign trade in sugar to implement the International Sugar Agreement. Title III: Domestic Sugar Price Support Program - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make an annual estimate of the sugar consumption needs of the United States. Directs the President to impose a fee on the importation of sugar in order to attain specified price objectives for domestic sugar. Authorizes the President to impose a quota on sugar imports, in accordance with certain restrictions. Makes such quota inapplicable to sugar imported for specified uses. Declares the domestic sugar price support program, but not the import fee and quota authority, to be a program within the Agricultural Act of 1949. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a system of domestic sugar price support payments, in accordance with specified formulae. Requires certain information to be furnished to the Secretary by persons engaged in the manufacture, marketing, transport, or industrial use of sugar. Suspends other price support programs for sugar. Title IV: General Provisions - Prohibits officials engaged in the Administration of this Act to invest in sugar. Sets forth penalties for violation of this Act, or rules and regulations issued under this Act."
