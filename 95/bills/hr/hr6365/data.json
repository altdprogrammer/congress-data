Sets a percentage limit on the mortgage value ratio of mortgages which will be insurable under this Act. Prescribes eligibility requirements for such insurance. States that mortgages or loans insured pursuant to this Act shall not be subject to State usury laws in most cases. Individual Housing Account Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for amounts paid in cash into an individual housing account. Defines the term \"individual housing account\" for the purposes of this Act. Limits annual tax deductions to $2,500 and lifetime deductions to $10,000. Makes provisions for tax treatment upon distribution of such accounts. Exempts individual housing accounts from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code."
