    "text": "Sellers of Travel or Travel Services Registration Act - Amends the International Travel Act of 1961 to establish within the Department of Commerce a National Travel Service Registration Advisory Council. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with such Council, to establish minimum criteria for travel services registration certificates. Prohibits any individual from engaging in the business of selling travel or travel services beginning one year after the enactment of this Act unless such individual has received a travel services registration certificate. Prohibits common carriers, persons engaged in the selling of travel or travel services, or intrastate direct air carriers regulated by State agencies from entering into contracts for the provision of travel to others with any person who is not a holder of a travel services registration certificate. Directs the Secretary, after consulting with the Council, to prescribe rules and regulations regarding the form and content of travel services registration certificates. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing such a certificate to an individual who does not meet the minimum qualification criteria or has been convicted of a felony. Stipulates that such certificates shall be nontransferable and shall expire on the second anniversary of their issuance. Directs the Secretary to grant renewals of such certificates if the individual continues to meet the minimum qualification criteria. Authorizes the Secretary, after a hearing, to suspend a certificate if the holder ceases to satisfy the qualification criteria or engages in specified prohibited actions. Grants the Secretary subpoena power to carry out the provisions of this Act. Sets forth provisions for judicial review of civil actions arising under this Act. Establishes criminal and civil penalties for violation of this Act. Stipulates that the Congress hereby preempts the field of engaging in the business of selling travel or travel services."
