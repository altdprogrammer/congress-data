States that to help solve patients' problems which do not require litigation, yet require aid, advice, or counseling, an ombudsperson system must be provided to which all clients of any mental health, mental retardation, or geriatric care system may have access. Establishes an Office of Mental Health and Disability Advocacy Services. Directs the Office to enter into contracts with States to assist them in meeting the costs of establishing and maintaining programs of mental health advocacy services. States that such contracts may not exceed 75 percent of the costs incurred in the program. Requires the program to include a mental health, retardation, and geriatric system ombudsperson. Prohibits any State from receiving assistance under the Community Mental Health Centers Act unless such State has established and maintains a mental health advocacy services program."
