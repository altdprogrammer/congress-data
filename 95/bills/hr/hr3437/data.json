    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-142) Amends the Vocational Education Act of 1963 to require the Bureau of Indian Affairs to pay a specified amount of the costs of vocational education programs administered for eligible Indian tribes. Increases the authorization of appropriations for State advisory councils on vocational education and allocates such funds according to a formula contained in such Act. Stipulates that the minimum expenditure requirements mandated for post secondary courses, the handicapped, and the disadvantaged apply only to the block grants made to a State. Permits the use of Federal funds for local administration but limits such use to the same percentage of funds as the Federal funds bear to the total program funds of the locality, or to 50 percent of the cost of local administration if matched by State funds. Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to pay State administrative costs from block grants made under such Act, and to pay 100 percent of the cost of State plans,reports, and administrations required by such Act. Permits a State to contract with a private vocational school capable of making a significant contribution to the State program at a reduced cost to the State. Limits the percentage of Federal funds, made available through basic grants, which can be used to pay the State administration expenses of any five year plan for vocational education program support or improvement. Grants State research coordinating unit, the power to contract for exemplary or innovation programs and for curriculum development projects. Delays the implementation dates for the national vocational education reporting system and the occupational information data system for one year. Permits the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education to accept gifts. Delays for one year the submission of reports by the National Institute of Education."
