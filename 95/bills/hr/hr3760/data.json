Provides for the voluntary delivery of handguns to any law enforcement agency for disposition, and entitles the transferor to a payment of $25 or the fair market value of the handgun, whichever is greater. Authorizes the Secretary to license pistol clubs conforming to specified minimal standards. Provides for administrative and judicial review of a license denial or revocation. Imposes criminal penalties on persons who violate provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe such rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
