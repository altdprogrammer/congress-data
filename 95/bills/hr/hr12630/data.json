    "text": "Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act: (1) to delete from the definition of fishing any operations at sea in support of or in preparation for catching or harvesting fish; and (2) to delete processing vessels from the definition of fishing vessels. Defines process or processing as any treatment of fish in preparation for commercial use. Defines a processing vessel as any vessel used to process, store, refrigerate or transport fish products. Prohibits any foreign processing fishing vessels from fishing within the fishery conservation zone unless such vessel has a valid permit issued pursuant to the Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to approve any application for a foreign processing vessel that proposes to receive fish harvested by vessels of the United States unless United States processing capability is adequate for processing the fish harvested from the fishery involved."
