Directs the Administrator to make grants for research projects designed to assist the furtherance of such program. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to evaluate and report the extent to which the automobile industry utilizes advanced automotive technology. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to test vehicles developed pursuant to the program established by this Act, in order to determine compliance with applicable standards under the Clean Air Act and the Noise Control Act of 1972. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to test such vehicles in order to determine compliance with applicable standards under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, and the Automobile Information Disclosure Act. Establishes contracting procedures consistent with applicable provisions of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to submit annual reports to Congress of activities pursuant to this Act, including results of economic surveys designed to evaluate the extent to which Federal guarantees of financial obligations may aid in developing commercial markets for advanced automobile technology. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to require that efforts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration be directed towards the development of advanced automobile propulsion systems. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Stipulates that no more than 60 percent of such appropriations shall be directly expended in Federal laboratories."
