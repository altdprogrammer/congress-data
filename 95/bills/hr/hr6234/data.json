Provides that persons not so authorized may not be prosecuted as accomplices or for conspiracy to violate this Act and no one may be prosecuted if the appropriate agency lacks a procedure through which such authorized persons could obtain review of the continuing necessity of the classification. Authorizes the Attorney General to seek injunctions against persons about to violate this Act."
