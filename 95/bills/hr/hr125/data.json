Prohibits the Secretary from imposing an eligibility requirement that a number of Indian children in excess of 15 percent of the total enrollment must be enrolled in such school. States that the amount of money provided shall be equal to the amount needed by such school to provide education of good quality, taking into account the special costs associated with educating Indian children, and the funds available from other sources. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out this Act."
