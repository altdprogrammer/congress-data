Requires such a restriction after January 1, 1981. Amends Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to exclude from the gross income of any individual, for the purpose of determining such individual's net earnings from self-employment, amounts which are received: (1) by any self-employed farmer in a year in which such farmer does not engage in substantial farm activitiy and which are derived from the sale of farm commodities produced in a prior year; and (2) by any individual after age 65 as a renewal commission from a life insurance policy which was sold through such individual's personal efforts in a prior year. Provides that service performed by a citizen of the United States as an employee of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission shall be considered as 'employment' under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act."
