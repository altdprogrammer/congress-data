Declares that a State, to be eligible for payments under this Act, shall have a plan for the administration of such program. Sets forth the requirements for approval of such a plan by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Authorizes the States to make payments for foster care maintenance and adoption assistance and sets forth the requirements children and adoptive parents must meet to receive assistance under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to fund the programs established by this Act and provides for payments to the States each quarter, according to a specified formula. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a State with technical assistance in developing programs established by this Act. Stipulates that the \"Federal share\" of child welfare services shall be 75 percent. Includes State expenditures for foster care services in the category of child welfare services. Limits the amount paid to any State for foster care. Directs that any excess appropriations be spent: (1) to conduct an inventory of all children under foster care for six months preceding such inventory; (2) to develop a statewide information system to locate such children; (3) to develop a case review system; and (4) to develop a program to help children remain with their families. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments directly to Indian tribal organizations which have an approved child welfare services plan. Revises the formula for determining the amount of earned income of a dependent child who does not qualify as a full or part-time student, or a relative, or an individual living in the household of the recipient, which a State must disregard in assessing need under the AFDC program of the Social Security Act. =Title II: Other Amendments Relating to Social Security Act= - Increases the ceiling on the total amount allocable to the States for social services. Revises the formula for determining Federal payments. Extends through fiscal year 1979 the provisions of Public Law 94-401 which provides additional funds for social services under Title XX of the Social Security Act. Provides Federal financial and technical support to the States for the installation of automated claims processing and management information systems to aid in the administration of State plans under the AFDC program. Requires recipients of aid under the AFDC program to register for manpower services, training, employment, and other employment related activities with the Secretary. Authorizes compensation to court personnel who perform services directly related to the Child Support and Establishment of Paternity program. Establishes 75 percent as the Federal medical assistance percentage to be applied to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. Increases the ceiling on public assistance for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. Includes the Northern Mariana Islands in those provisions of the Social Security Act concerning Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam."
