    "text": "Establishes procedures for taking the decennial census. Establishes a decennial census period beginning two years prior to the decennial census date and ending three years after such date. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce during this period to conduct a trial census which shall be the final test of all the procedures to be used in taking the decennial census. Requires the Secretary to submit a report regarding such trial census to specified committees in Congress prior to conducting such a census. Stipulates that no changes may be made in the content or procedures to be used in taking a decennial census after four months following the date of a trial census. Stipulates that the decennial census shall consist only of: (1) an enumeration of the population; (2) sample surveys of the characteristics of the population and housing of the United States; and (3) supplemental surveys necessary to meet the needs of the Federal, State, or local government for economic and social data. Sets forth restrictions regarding the collection of such data. Allows employees conducting the enumeration of population access to the records of the Federal Government and of State or local governments which are necessary to insure that all individuals and households are counted. Stipulates that such employees may obtain only names and addresses from such records and that such information may only be used for purposes of the enumeration. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct special surveys in a State for the purpose of clarifying the findings of decennial supplemental surveys. Directs the Secretary to prepare a plan specifying procedures to be used for correcting errors in census counts and to submit such plan to specified committees in Congress. Directs the Secretary, beginning in 1985, to conduct a mid-decade census of population. Requires the use of the most recent data, either from the decennial or mid-decade census, in determining eligibility for benefits under Federal programs in which census data is a factor. Requires the Secretary to submit specified reports to Congress prior to the taking of a decennial or mid-decade census. Directs the Secretary to insure that the language and categories of questions used on census forms take into account the needs and preferences of the public and to establish a program to provide information to the public regarding the need for, and operation of, the decennial census. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program for the training and selection of supervisory employees engaged in decennial census activities. Directs the Secretary to prepare a plan for conducting censuses other than the decennial or mid- decade census and to submit such plan to Congress at least 60 days before the census is begun. Authorizes the Secretary to issue \"determination estimates,\" defined as estimates derived from any data which (1) is not produced as an activity of the decennial census period and (2) is produced to enable the executive branch of the Federal Government to determine the amount of benefit received under a Federal law by a State or local government. Sets forth procedures by which a State or local government may challenge such an estimate. Directs the Secretary to establish a Division of Evaluation within the Bureau of the Census to evaluate censuses and to submit the results of such evaluation to the Secretary and the Director of the Census. Directs the General Accounting Office to review evaluations made by the Division every three years. Directs the Secretary in 1979, in 1983, and in every fifth year thereafter, to conduct a census of agriculture. Directs the Secretary to conduct a census of irrigation and drainage in 1979, 1983, and every tenth year after 1983."
