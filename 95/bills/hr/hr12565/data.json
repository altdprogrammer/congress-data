    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Self-Employment Tax Payments Act - Title I: Short Title, Etc. - Declares that the payment of social security benefits based upon reported self-employment income on which no self-employment tax is paid undermines the financial soundness of the social security system and is unfair to employees whose wages are subject to withholding under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. Title II: Certification of the Payment of Self-Employment Tax - Amends Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to make the payment of social security benefits based upon reported self-employment income conditional upon the actual payments of taxes due with respect to such income. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish and maintain records of the amounts of self-employment tax paid for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978. Provides that such records shall constitute evidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding for purposes of proving payment or nonpayment of self-employment taxes. Permits the Secretary to correct any erroneous entry in such records within the statutory time limitation (3 years, 3 months, and 15 days) and deems such corrected records, after the expiration of such time limitation, as conclusive evidence of payment or nonpayment of self-employment taxes. Permits the Secretary to make such corrections after the expiration of the time limitation under certain conditions."
