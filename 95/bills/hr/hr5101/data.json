Rept. 95-722) Environmental Research, Development and Demonstration Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations to the Environmental Protection agency for environmental research, development, and demonstration activities for fiscal year 1978. Specifies amounts authorized for air quality, water quality, water supply, pesticides, solid waste, toxic substances, radiation, energy, and interdisciplinary activities. Prohibits transfers of funds among listed categories above a specified amount without prior Congressional approval by the appropriate committees. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for grants to assist public agencies in the development and demonstration of projects relating to the providing of safe drinking water to the public. Directs the Administrator to establish a Science Advisory Board to provide such scientific advice as the Administrator requests. Requests the Board to conduct a review of and submit a report to the Administrator, the President, and Congress concerning the health effects research authorized by this Act and other law focusing special attention on the procedural safeguards required to preserve the scientific integrity of such research and to insure reporting and use of the results of such research in subsequent recommendations. Directs the Administrator to coordinate environmental research, developments, and demonstration programs of the EPA with the heads of other Federal agencies in order to minimize unnecessary duplication of programs, projects, and research facilities. Directs the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality to report to the Congress and the President regarding coordination of environmental research and development. Directs the Administrator to implement the recommendations of a report prepared for the House Committee on Science and Technology entitled \"The Environmental Protection Agency Program with primary emphasis on the Community Health and Environmental Surveillance System (CHESS); An Investigative Report.
