    "text": "Census Act - Establishes procedures for taking the decennial census of population. Authorizes the officers or public bodies having initial responsibility for the legislative apportionment or districting in each State to submit a plan to the Secretary of Commerce identifying the geographic areas for which specific tabulations of populations are desired. Requires that such plans be developed in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary which will insure that such plan will be developed in a nonpartisan manner. Stipulates that the decennial census shall consist of: (1) an enumeration of the population; (2) sample surveys of the characteristics of population and housing; and (3) supplemental surveys as the Secretary considers necessary or when the State requests such a survey under specified circumstances. Sets forth restrictions regarding the collection of such data. Allows employees conducting the enumeration of population access to the records of the Federal Government, and of State and local governments which are necessary to insure that all individuals and households are counted. Stipulates that the survey of housing and population characteristics be conducted only through the use of samples and prohibits the Secretary from using any questionnaire for such survey unless it has been submitted to Congress and neither House has disapproved the use of such questionnaire by resolution. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct special surveys in a State for the purpose of clarifying the findings of the survey of characteristics under specified circumstances. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures for determining if errors have occurred in the process of collecting data for the enumeration of population or the survey of housing and population characteristics. Directs the Secretary beginning in 1985 and every ten years thereafter to conduct a mid-decade census of population. Requires the use of the most recent data, either from the decennial or mid-decade census, in determining eligibility for benefits under Federal programs in which census data is a factor. Requires the Secretary to submit specified reports to Congress prior to the taking of a decennial or mid-decade census. Directs the Secretary to seek the cooperation of States and units of local government in conducting the decennial census and to insure they are consulted and their needs taken into account in the publication of the results of such census. Directs the Secretary to insure that the language and categories of questions used on census forms take into account the needs and preferences of the public and do not cause arbitrary or awkward responses. Directs the Secretary to establish a public participation plan and public information plan in the taking of the decennial census. Authorizes the Secretary to issue determination estimates defined as estimates derived from any data which is not produced as an activity of the decennial census period, and which is produced to enable the executive branch to determine the amount of benefit received under Federal law by a State or unit of local government. Sets forth procedures by which a State or unit of local government may challenge such an estimate. Establishes a Census Review Committee to review policies of the Bureau of the Census, to assess the accuracy and quality of data published by the Bureau and to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to long-range planning for the activities of the Bureau. Requires the Bureau to conduct its activities in accordance with standards established by the Committee. Stipulates that such Committee shall terminate ten years after the enactment of this Act. Requires the General Accounting Office to audit the activities of the Committee no later than nine years after the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations specifying, for each group of temporary staff, the conditions under which such staff may be utilized, the number of staff which may be utilized at one time, and the information to which such staff may have access. Directs the Secretary in 1979, in 1983 and every fifth year after to take a census of agriculture and to take a census of irrigation and drainage in conjunction with such census in 1979, in 1988 and every tenth year thereafter."
