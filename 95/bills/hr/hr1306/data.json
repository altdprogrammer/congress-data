    "text": "Natural Resource Information Act - Title I: Bureau of Natural Resource Information - Establishes a Bureau of National Resource Information within the Department of Commerce to operate, maintain, and improve the National Resource Information System established by this Act. Title II: National Resource Information System - Establishes a National Resource Information System to contain the following three components: a public library, a confidential library, and a secret library. Establishes procedures governing unlimited access to information in the public library. Limits access to the confidential library to Federal Government officials for official use only. Stipulates that information in the secret library be published only in statistical aggregates and that access to such information be limited to sworn officers or employees of the Bureau or the Department of Commerce. Establishes priorities for entry of information into the System. Establishes standards for classification of information as confidential or secret based on national security or reasonable competitive equities. Authorizes the Secretary or the Director of the Bureau to conduct hearings or disputes as to classification of such information. Imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosures of confidential or secret information, for thefts of information from the system, and for failure to provide required information to the System. Authorizes the Secretary or the Director to enforce subpoenas in United States district courts in order to gain access to information for the System. Title III: Inventories and Inspections by the Department of the Interior - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to compile and maintain, on an annual basis, an inventory of natural resources in public lands of the United States, including the Outer Continental Shelf. Stipulates that the inventories may be based on estimates, supplemented as feasible by onsite geological and engineering inspections by departmental personnel. Requires that the first inventory be completed within 18 months and reported to Congress within 20 months of the effective date of this title. Directs that copies of all such annual reports and inventories be given to the Director for inclusion in the System's public library. Requires the Secretary, upon request by the Director, to make onsite inspections to verify information contained in such reports. Title IV: Information on Natural Resources - Requires that substantial natural resource companies file verified annual reports with the Director which describe the natural resources or mineral reserves which they own or control. Establishes procedures for submission of such material for inclusion in the System. Title V: Information on Natural Resource Industries - Requires major companies in commerce to file verified annual reports, on an establishment basis, on their operations worldwide. Requires that such reports be made in two parts, one for the public library of the System and the other for the confidential or secret library. Authorizes the Secretary or the Director to require such reports more often than annually in specified cases, and to require from major natural resource companies lists describing all mandatory and voluntary reports they file elsewhere which contain natural resource information. Title VI: General Accounting Office Oversight - Directs the Comptroller General of the United States, to review and evaluate procedures and activities of the Bureau. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress at least annually on such reviews of the Bureau. Title VII: Conformance of and with Other Statutes - Amends the Freedom of Information Act and the Federal Reports Act of 1942 to maintain consistency with the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Director to excuse reporting requirements for companies where similar information has been reported to the Census Bureau and where the company has agreed to waive the secrecy provisions of the Census Code. Title VIII: Miscellaneous - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior to fulfill the duties imposed by this Act. Specifies effective dates for the various provisions of the Act."
