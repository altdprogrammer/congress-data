    "text": "Congressional Legal Counsel Act - Establishes, as a Congressional office, the Office of Congressional Legal Counsel to be headed by a Congressional Legal Counsel to defend Congress, a House of Congress, committee, subcommittee, Member, officer, or employee of Congress or an agency of Congress in civil actions in which the validity of any official proceeding or action taken by such person or entity is placed in issue or in cases involving subpoenas. Requires that specified representational activities undertaken by the Counsel be authorized by the Joint Leadership Group, the House, the Senate, or concurrent resolutions, or committee affirmation according to the proposed action. Requires the Counsel, upon direction, to bring a civil action to enforce any subpoena issued by a House of Congress, committee or subcommittee authorized to issue such subpoena. Gives the District Court for the District of Columbia original jurisdiction over any civil action brought by a House of Congress or any authorized committee or subcommittee concerning the enforcement or validity of subpoenas. Requires the Counsel to intervene or appear as amicus curiae in the name of Congress, a House of Congress, or an officer, office, agency, committee, subcommittee or chairman thereof of a House of Congress or of Congress in any legal action in any Federal or State court in which the powers and responsibilities of Congress, under the Constitution, are placed in issue. Directs the Counsel to notify the Joint Leadership Group of any legal action in which the Counsel is of the opinion that intervention is in the interest of Congress. Stipulates that the Counsel shall represent a House of Congress or committee or subcommittee in immunity proceedings. Requires the Counsel, upon the direction of the House or the Senate or any Member or committee thereof, to review any rule or regulation published by any Federal department or agency. Provides for a civil action to be brought by the Counsel to challenge the validity of any such rule or regulation. Requires the Counsel to notify the Joint Leadership Group and any affected party of any conflict between the representation of such party and the carrying out of this Act, or compliance with professional standards. Sets forth the procedure for resolving such conflict. Relieves the Attorney General of any responsibility with respect to representational service encompassed by this Act upon written notice that the Counsel has undertaken such service. Authorizes appropriations to the Office through fiscal year 1982 to carry out its duties under this Act."
