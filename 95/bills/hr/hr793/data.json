    "text": "Amends Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to provide monthly insurance benefits for dependent relatives of individuals entitled to old-age or disability insurance benefits or of individuals who were fully and currently insured at the time of their death. Stipulates that such dependent's benefits shall be available to an individual under the age of 18 or over the age of 62 who was receiving at least one-half of his support from the insured individual. Sets forth the conditions upon which payment of dependent's benefits will begin and cease. States that if a dependent is eligible for old-age or disability benefits in his own right he shall be entitled to the larger of his own benefit or the dependent's benefit for which he is eligible. Establishes regulations for determining the amount of an individual's dependent's benefit."
