Prohibits the establishment, by State or Federal law of interest rate differentials between: (1) banks, other than savings banks, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and (2) savings and loan, building and loan, or homestead associations (including cooperative banks) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, or mutual savings banks, on savings accounts from which automatic transfers to third-party payment accounts may be made pursuant to the prearranged agreement of depositors or accountholders. Title II: Federal Savings and Loan Investment Authority - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to authorize Federal savings and loan associations to invest in, sell or otherwise deal with specified loans and investments. Title III: National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility - Establishes the National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility to provide funds to meet the liquidity needs of credit unions. Vests management of the Facility in the National Credit Union Administration.

Authorizes the Administration to deny or grant any application upon such terms as it may prescribe by regulations. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to lend the Facility up to $500,000,000 to enable it to meet the obligations arising under this Act. Directs the Administration to prepare and submit to the President and to the Congress annually a full report on the activities of the Facility for the previous year.
