Rept. 95-1153) Child Nutrition Amendments - Amends the National School Lunch Act to extend the child care food program. States formulae for reimbursement assistance to States for meals served to children in institutions, other than family and group day care home sponsoring organizations, based on the percentage in an institution of children from families that satisfy specified income standards for free and reduced-price meals. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish maximum per meal reimbursement rates for each such percentage category. States that reimbursement for administrative expenses shall include start-up funds for institutions to initiate successful operation under the program. Requires the Secretary to make administrative cost, food cost, and menu choice studies, and studies of the licensing problems of institutions and group and family day care homes. Increases from $3,000,000 to $6,000,000 the amount of appropriated funds earmarked for food service equipment assistance. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to extend through 1982 the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC). Directs the Secretary to establish income eligibility standards in accordance with the nonfarm poverty income guidelines of the Office of Management and Budget. Requires each State agency to assure the provision of nutrition education at all participants in the WIC program. Specifies contents of State agency plans of operation and administration required to be submitted to the Secretary for approval. Specifies formulae for the allocation and distribution of administrative funds. Requires an annual report to the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition describing plans to ensure continual participation in the program by migrants as they move among the States. Requires the adjustment of the reimbursement assistance rate according to a Department of Agriculture Wholesale Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions, instead of the Consumer Price Index. Specifies the components of the Wholesale Price Index. Permits combined allocation and accounting of funds under the school lunch and breakfast programs. Increases from $40,000,000 to $75,000,000 the amount of food service equipment appropriations authorized for fiscal years after 1975 under the Child Nutrition Act. Assigns as allocation priority (50 percent) of funds to schools that do not serve both breakfasts and lunches but that will use food service equipment to initiate the service of breakfasts or lunches. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold up to ten percent of funds appropriated for nutrition education and training programs in order to carry out innovative research and demonstration projects."
