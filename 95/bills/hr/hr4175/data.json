Requires that recreation fees be stated separately from any other fees charged purchasers of dwelling units in the project. Establishes requirements to protect tenants in a leased-unit structure to be converted to condominium use, including assurances that tenants have received prior notice, a period of at least three months to decide whether or not to purchase their units and for those tenants renting under a lease, specific protection from eviction and abridgment of the lease. Requires developers to disclose to new purchasers operating costs, service benefits, and planned structure alterations. Requires a 15-day cancellation period. Requires the Secretary to publish a form for developers embodying provisions for all of the information required in such statement. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State and local governments to help establish or expand offices or agencies to administer similar requirements and procedures. Sets forth penalties for the violation of this Act."
