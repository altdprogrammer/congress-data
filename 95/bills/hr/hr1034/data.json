    "text": "Guarantees to every athlete who wishes to engage in an organized professional team sport, the right to enter into a contract for such a purpose with any person without: (1) agreeing to permit that person to control his right, upon expiration of the contract, to enter into a contract with another person for such purpose, or; (2) agreeing to perform under such a contract for an unreasonable period of time. Declares such contract provisions unenforceable. States that a provision requiring an athlete to secure a release from the other party to the contract before entering into another sports contract is unenforceable. States that any person who deprives or conspires to deprive an athlete of his rights under this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor."
