Revises the formula for the determination of beef and veal import quotas. Revises the criteria under which the President may suspend a proclamation limiting beef and veal imports to permit such suspension only during a national emergency or when the supply of such products is inadequate because of a natural disaster, to meet domestic supply at reasonable prices. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to study the regional economic impact of imports of beef and veal and report the results of such study to the Ways and Means Committee of the House and to the Finance Committee of the Senate."
