Encompasses within such prohibition (1) any folding knife having an exposed blade of at least three inches; (2) any manufacture, sale, or possession of a prohibited knife by a person engaged in any trade or business involving the acquisition of articles in interstate commerce or the sale of articles or transfer of sold articles in interstate commerce; and (3) the transfer of possession of a prohibited knife by a member of the Armed Forces to any other person other than in the performance of duty. Amends the provision of law declaring switchblade knives unmailable to prohibit the mailing of such knives to supply or procurement officers of a State or local government. Applies such provision to folding knives having an exposed blade of at least three inches."
