Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare, publish and transmit to the Secretary of the Treasury an Automobile Consumption Schedule listing the fuel consumption rates of each automobile as determined under tests conducted by the Agency. Grants an exemption from certain emission standards under the Clean Air Act to automobiles with greater fuel efficiency than that which pertains to the lowest excise tax applicable to the automobiles' model year. Provides for the public dissemination of the tax applied against each car and its rating in the Consumption Schedule. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations necessary to effectuate this Act."
