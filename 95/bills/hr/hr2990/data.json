    "text": "Joint Committee on Intelligence Operations Act - Establishes an 18 member Joint Committee on Intelligence Operations to exercise exclusive legislative and oversight jurisdiction over the foreign intelligence activities and operations of specified Federal intelligence agencies and departments. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to keep the Joint Committee informed with respect to all foreign intelligence activities and operations of certain Federal intelligence agencies. Authorizes the joint committee to require reports from such agencies regarding foreign intelligence. Requires that all bills and resolutions of the Senate or the House of Representatives relating to the functions of specified Federal intelligence agencies be referred to the joint committee. Gives the joint committee certain administrative powers, including the power to subpoena witnesses and documents. Requires the joint committee to establish guidelines for the classification of its materials consistent with those used by the executive branch, and to establish guidelines under which its records shall be made available to Members of Congress and certain congressional officers or employees. Sets forth criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of materials of or information obtained by the joint committee, with respect to foreign intelligence, by any former or current staff member or employee of the joint committee, or any current or former officer of the House or the Senate. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to: (1) make the joint committee the only committee to which the President must submit certain reports regarding nonintelligence gathering operations of the Central Intelligence Agency; (2) prohibit the expenditure of funds for any such operation until the end of a 30 day period beginning on the date the President submits such report to the joint committee; and (3) empower the joint committee to enjoin the spending of funds for any such operation upon appropriate resolution. Amends rules X of the Rules of the House of Representatives to remove from the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on International Relations matters relating to intelligence activities and operations."
