    "text": "Clean Air Amendments - Amends the Clean Air Act to revise the purposes of the Act in order to encourage air quality control measures which consider total environmental, economic, and social impact. Revises requirements for State clean air implementation plans to authorize use of alternative control strategies and methods, including more cost-effective methods, of achieving national primary or secondary clean air standards. Requires that State implementation plans establish procedures to allow variances from stationary source emission controls where (1) alternative emission control strategies or limitations will meet ambient air standards for the source in question and (2) the economic and social costs of compliance with the specified emission controls are not justified by the additional economic and social benefits. Authorizes variances from new source performance standards where such controls are not justified based on a comparison of costs and benefits. Stipulates that the burden of proof to show that such costs are not justified shall be on the petitioner in such cases."
