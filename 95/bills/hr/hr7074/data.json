Requires the Secretary, or his representative, to meet with officials of the city of Portland to review planned management programs, and their impact on the quality and quantity of the water produced on the unit. Specifies arbitration as the method to be used for resolving differences between the Secretary and the city regarding management and use of the unit. Authorizes the Secretary, after consultation with the city, to promulgate regulations for controlling entry into the unit by all persons."
