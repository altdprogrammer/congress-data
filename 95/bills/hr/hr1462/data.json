Stipulates that no information regarding the record of a person charged with a criminal offense against the laws of the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States shall be withheld from any court trying such person on the grounds that such information related to juvenile proceedings if such proceedings related to an act which would have been a criminal offense if such person had been an adult."
