    "date": "1977-04-06", 
    "text": "Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to raise the ceiling on aggregate water and waste facility grants from $300,000,000 in any fiscal year to $500,000,000 in fiscal year 1977, $750,000,000 in fiscal year 1978, and $1,000,000,000 in any fiscal year thereafter. Raises the amount of each grant from 50 to 75 percent of the development cost of a project. States that, if an association receives a 25 percent grant from other sources, a project's economic feasibility shall be based exclusively on the association's ability to meet normal operation and maintenance costs of the proposed systems. Requires that the facilities included in a project be economically constructed and that guaranteed rural housing loans be processed only by the State or other designated regional offices of the Farmers Home Administration. Establishes an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Equal Opportunity."
