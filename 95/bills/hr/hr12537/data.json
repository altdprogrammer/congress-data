Title II: Amendments to Chapter 641 of Title 10, United States Code - Amends the provisions of Federal law to direct the Secretary of the Energy in administering Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3 to further develop such reserves to a capacity to produce at a maximum efficient rate for purposes of national defense. Directs the Secretary, during the period ending April 5, 1982, to produce naval reserves 1 and 3 at the lowest rate sufficient to support the cost of exploration, development, operation, and acquisitions of the naval petroleum reserves. Removes the time limitation for pipelines and facilities for Petroleum Reserve Number 1 to accommodate not less than 350,000 barrels of oil per day. Changes the date when the Secretary is authorized to exercise the authority for condemnation over certain privately owned lands within Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1. Makes certain technical amendments relating to the Naval Petroleum Reserves, including making the Secretary of Energy (presently Secretary of the Navy) responsible for the administration of the reserves."
