    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) International Maritime Satellite Telecommunications Act - Amends the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to provide for United States participation in the International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat). Designates the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat) as the sole operating entity of the United States for participation in Inmarsat, for the purpose of providing international maritime satellite telecommunications services. Grants Comsat authortiy to participate in any other maritime satellite telecommunications system on an interim basis subject to specified conditions. Authorizes Comsat to own and operate satellite earth terminal stations in the United States. Requires Comsat to interconnect such stations and their maritime satellite telecommunications with the facilities and services of United States domestic common carriers, international common carriers, and private communications systems, as authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Authorizes Comsat to establish, own, and operate the United States share of the jointly owned international space segment and associated ancillary facilities. Requires Comsat to meet all financial obligations arising from participation in such organization. Designates Comsat as the sole United States representative in the managing body of the organization. Allows any person, including the Government, to own and/or operate, a satellite earth terminal station used exclusively for: (1) training personnel for station operation or maintenance; or (2) experimentation relating to maritime satellite telecommunications services. Requires that such satellite earth terminal station be authorized by the appropriate executive department in the case of the Government, or by the FCC in all other cases. Stipulates that the FCC may authorize ownership of satellite earth terminal stations by persons other than Comsat at any time the FCC determines that such additional ownership will enhance the provision of maritime satellite services in the public interest. Directs the FCC to determine the operational arrangements under which Comsat will interconnect its satellite terminal stations with United States domestic common carriers, international common carriers, and private communications systems. Requires the FCC to make its initial determination within six months of the enactment of this Act and to report on that determination to Congress. Requires the articles of incorporation of Comsat, notwithstanding any State law, to provide for the continued ability to transact business without the otherwise required number of directors whenever the President or his delegate determine that a national emergency exists. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) coordinate the activities of governmental agencies other than the FCC with responsiblities in the telecommunications field; (2) ensure the availability and utilization of the telecommunications services provided Inmarsat for general governmental purposes, except when a separate telecommunications system is required to meet unique governmental needs or is otherwise in the national interest; (3) seek to obtain coordinated and efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum and orbital space; (4) ensure technical compatibility of the space segment with existing communications facilities in the United States and in foreign countries; and (5) determine the interests and needs of the ultimate users of the maritime satellites telecommunications system. Requires the President to issue instructions to Comsat concerning its relationships and activities with foreign governments, international entities and Inmarsat to ensure consistency with United States foreign policy. Requires the FCC to institute necessary proceedings to carry out this Act and make recommendations to the President to assist the President in issuing instructions to the Corporation. Directs the FCC to grant authorizations to enable Comsat to: (1) provide to the public through interconnecting carriers space segment channels of communication obtained from Inmarsat or such similar organization; and (2) construct and operate the satellite earth terminal stations in the United States. Requires the FCC to: (1) establish procedures for the continuing review of Comsat's telecommunications activities as the United States signatory to the operating agreement; and (2) prescribe rules necessary to carry out this Act. Authorizes the FCC to issue instructions to Comsat on matters within its regulatory jurisdiction. Directs the FCC to conduct a study of Comsat to determine whether any changes in corporate structure and operating activities are necessary to carry out is functions under this Act, and the Communications Act of 1934. Requires the FCC to report within 18 months to Congress on such findings, on resultant action by the FCC, and on FCC recommendations for legislative or other appropriate action. Directs the FCC to conduct a study of public maritime coast station services, particularly high seas services, to determine whether FCC rules and regulations need to be changed to provide modern and effective maritime telecommunications services. Mandates an FCC report to Congress within 12 months on such study findings, and on FCC actions and recommendations flowing therefrom. Provides that the President, with affected Government agencies, shall study all Government radio navigation systems, to develop a plan to reduce the proliferation and overlap of such systems. Directs the President to report to Congress within 12 months on such findings and conclusions, Presidential actions taken, and recommendations for legislative or other appropriate action to implement a Government-wide radio navigation plan."
