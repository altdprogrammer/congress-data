Requires all imported dairy products, after entry into the United States, to be subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other dairy product inspection Acts. Provides for cooperation between the Secretary and foreign governments as well as other executive departments in carrying out this Act, and authorizes necessary inspections and investigations."
