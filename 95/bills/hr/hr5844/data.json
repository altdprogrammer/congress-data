Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to use 80 percent of the appropriations authorized under this Act to make grants to State departments of agriculture. Requires the State departments to use such funds to establish: (1) one model farm to demonstrate all the agricultural conservation research projects; and (2) during each calendar year after the first two years for which a State department receives grants, not less than ten demonstrations of agricultural conservation research projects which the department selects from among the projects demonstrated on the model farm. Stipulates the terms of any agreement entered into between selected farmowners and the State departments of agriculture for the establishment of such demonstration projects. Authorizes the appropriation of $20,000,000 for the purposes of this Act."
