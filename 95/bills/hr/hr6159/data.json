    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Amendments - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations to extend through fiscal year 1979, for Federal aid to State public water system supervision programs. Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to extend appropriations for the rural water survey through fiscal year 1979. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to submit a report to Congress analyzing the anticipated cost of compliance with interim and revised national primary drinking water regulations and methods of paying the costs of compliance. Requires the Administrator to submit to Congress a report on the availability of an adequate and dependable supply of safe drinking water. Directs the Administrator to provide training for personnel of State and local agencies which have primary enforcement responsibility of public water systems. Allows the Administrator, under specified conditions, to make a grant to a State that has not assumed primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State. Allows the Administrator to extend the date for submission of an application by a State for approval of the State's underground injection control program. Extends through fiscal year 1979 the authority of the Administrator to assure the availability of chemicals needed for water treatment. Makes each Federal agency having jurisdiction over any federally maintained public water system or engaged in any activity which may result in underground injection endangering drinking water, subject to all Federal, State, and local requirements, administrative authorities, and process sanctions respecting safe drinking water. Adds to the definition of \"person\" for purposes of title XIV (Safety of Public Water Systems), Federal agencies, officers, employees, and agents of any corporation, company, association, State, municipality, or Federal agency. Specifies the rights of citizens, States, and local governments to commence a civil action against any person in violation of title XIV. Directs the Administrator to prepare and make reasonably available to the public, an economic assessment statement before publication of notice of proposed rulemaking respecting the safety of public water systems."
