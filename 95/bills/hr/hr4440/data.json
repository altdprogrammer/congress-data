Title II: Administrative Provisions and Feasibility Studies - Requires the Attorney General to establish a border patrol force of not less than 3,800 border patrol officers to patrol the land borders of the United States. Requires the Attorney General to conduct a study of the feasibility of establishing a system for the issuance of machine-readable cards to aliens entering the United States to facilitate their identification for the purposes of the administration of immigration laws and of utilizing the most current available technology in electronic sensing devices for use by the border patrol force in patrolling the land borders of the United States. Requires the results of such study to be presented to the President and Congress within one year after the enactment of this Act."
