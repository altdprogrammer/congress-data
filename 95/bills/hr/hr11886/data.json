Provides that if a veteran entitled to the regular aid-and-attendance allowance is in need of a higher level of care and but for such care would require residential institutional care, such veterans shall receive an increased allowance. Increases the monthly rate of compensation payable to a veteran whose service-connected disabilities are less than total and who has suffered the service-connected loss of one extremity and the non-service-connected loss of the paired extremity, provided each loss is ratable at 40 percent or more. Authorizes dependency allowances to be paid for veterans rated 30 percent and above. Increased the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans. =Title II: Survivors' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Benefits= - Increases the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the surviving spouses and dependent children of disabled veterans. Provides for the payment of benefits to the surviving spouses and children of totally disabled veterans if at the time of the veteran's death the rating had been in effect for ten years or five years from the date of discharge and the marriage was in effect two or more years immediately preceding the veteran's death. =Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Exempts persons eligible for compensation under laws administered by the Veteran's Administration (VA) but for the receipt of retirement pay for certain government service from taxation in an amount equal to the amount of such (VA) compensation. Increases from $100 to $200 the monthly rate of the special pension paid to recipients of the Medal of Honor. Increases from $800 to $1,100 the allowance payable for the funeral and burial of veterans whose deaths are service-connected. Authorizes memorial markers to honor Veterans who died while on active duty and whose remains are not recoverable. Increases the automobile assistance allowance for certain disabled veterans. Requires the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to study disability compensation awarded to, and health-care needs of, veterans who are former prisoners of war, and to report to the President and Congress on the results of such study by February 1, 1980. Stipulates that only United States citizens be employed as superintendents and assistant superintendents of American Battle Monuments Commission cemeteries. Directs the Secretary to place in the Trophy Hall of the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery, a Memorial plaque to pay tribute to members of the Armed Forces who served honorably in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict. =Title IV: Effective Dates= - Sets forth October 1, 1978, as the effective date for all provisions of this Act except the provision regarding Medals of Honor which shall take effect on January 1, 1979."
