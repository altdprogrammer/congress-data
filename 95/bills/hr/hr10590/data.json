    "text": "Trade Procedures Reform Act - Amends the Antidumping Act of 1921 to require conditional payment of antidumping duty upon entry of imported articles. Permits \"across-the-board\" appraisal of the value of such articles. Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury, upon an interim finding that certain imports are unlikely to injure United States industries, to refer the case to the International Trade Commission for investigation. Permits simultaneous investigation by the Secretary and the ITC. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to permit Congressional disapproval of the President's determination to reduce import relief. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to procedures for relief from unfair trade practices through complaint to the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to initiate investigations within 30 days with respect to the existence of violations of such Act which require the imposition of countervailing duties (subsidy of imported products by foreign governments)."
