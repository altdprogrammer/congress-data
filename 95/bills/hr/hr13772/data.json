    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 to establish an Office of Audits, Investigations and Compliance in the Department of Labor to conduct audits and investigations relating to CETA programs. Directs recipients of funds under this Act to keep and make available records as may be required. Authorizes the Director of the Office to have access to such records, to require their production by subpoena, and to make necessary investigations. Makes it unlawful for any person: (1) to neglect or refuse to attend and testify, or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce documentary evidence as required by the Secretary; and (2) to willfully make any false entry or statement of fact in any report required by the Act or to willfully neglect or fail to make full and true entries in such records or to willfully remove out of the jurisdiction of the United States or to falsify any documentary evidence of recipients or to willfully refuse to submit records or to deny access to the Secretary's authorized agents. Requires the Director to submit to Congress semiannual reports which include summaries of investigations and policy recommendations. Provides for the future transfer of functions of the Office of Audits, Investigations, and Compliance an Office of Inspector General within the Department of Labor, whenever such Office of Inspector General is established."
