    "text": "Health Services Extension Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1978 for grants to: (1) States for comprehensive public health services; (2) hypertension programs; (3) planning, development and operation of migrant health centers; (4) planning, development and operation of community health centers; (5) training and research of family planning projects; (6) infant sudden death syndrome programs; (7) hemophilia programs; and (8) blood separation centers. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to take into account unusual local conditions which are a barrier to access to personal health services when defining a medically underserved population. Authorizes the Administrator of the National Credit Union Administration to make insured loans to eligible students. Changes the definition of eligible institution for the purpose of student assistant programs to mean a school of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, or public health within the United States that received a grant, or that the Secretary determines met the requirements for a grant for the preceding fiscal year. Extends to all educational loans obtained by an individual for costs at a school of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, or podiatry the program of loan forgiveness by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under specific employment agreements. Includes tuition and fees in traineeship awards made to students in schools of public health. Requires a school of medicine to reserve positions in the school year for students transferring from foreign schools of medicine. Directs the Secretary to identify those students who were enrolled either in foreign medical schools or in schools in the United States which prepare a student for entrance into the third year of medical school in the United States, and who passed part I of the National Board of Medical Examiners' examination. Directs the Secretary to apportion positions among schools of medicine in the United States to accommodate such students. Requires each area health center to provide a medical residency training program in general internal medicine, family medicine, or general pediatrics. Directs that grants for training in emergency medicine include the cost of graduate medical education traineeships for individuals who intend to specialize in the practice of emergency medicine. Directs that grants be made and contracts entered into for the improvement of programs of recruitment, training, and retraining of allied health personnel. Includes all public or nonprofit private entities capable of carrying out allied health special projects in the definition of entities eligible for grants for such projects. Establishes an Indian Health Scholarship Program under the national Health Service Corps Scholarship program. Directs the Secretary to make computations for certain nursing school programs based on the school year during which grants were applied. Amends the Community Mental Health Centers Act to extend through fiscal year 1978 appropriations for: (1) planning and operation of community health centers; and (2) the National Center for Prevention and control of Rape. Increases from two to three the number of grants that a community mental health center is authorized to receive under sections of law in effect prior to the 1975 amendments to this Act without meeting the new requirements of this Act. Amends the Social Security Act to authorize appropriations for maternal and child health and crippled children's services for fiscal year 1978, and for each fiscal year thereafter. Amends the Social Security Amendments of 1972 to extend, through fiscal year 1980, the authority of the Secretary to pay States under the Medicaid program for the compensation or training of inspectors of long term care facilities. Authorizes appropriations for home health services and home health services training under the Social Security Act for fiscal year 1978. Amends the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 to authorize State plans required to be submitted under that Act to contain provisions relating to drug abuse or mental health. Amends the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 to require that the Director of the Office of Drug Abuse Policy not be an employee of any department or agency of the United States engaged in any drug traffic prevention function. Amends the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 to permit individuals who received scholarships under the Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program before September 30,1977, to use periods of residency or internship served in a facility of the Public Health Service to satisfy obligations incurred under that Program."
