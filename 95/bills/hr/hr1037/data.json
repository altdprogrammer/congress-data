    "text": "(Measure failed of passage in House, roll call #671 (165-257)) Energy Transportation Security Act - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to direct the Secretary of Commerce to assure that four and one-half percent of the gross tonnage of oil transported in bulk on ocean vessels for import into the United States shall be carried on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels to the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates). Conditions such requirement upon the Secretary of State certifying that such action will not violate any treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation with NATO nations, and the Secretary of the Treasury certifying that such action will not reduce total national employment and gross national product. Raises the requirement by one percent for each fiscal year after June 30, 1978, and to nine and one-half percent after June 30, 1982. Requires the Secretary to make annual reports to the Congress and the President on the implementation of this Act. Exempts from the provisions of this Act refineries whose capacity is less than 50,000 barrels per day or for small, or independent refiners as defined in this Act. Imposes a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each day any provision or regulation under this Act is violated. Allows foreign built vessels documented under the U.S. flag and employing U.S. crew members to qualify to carry imported oil into the United States. Directs the Secretary to assure that crew members of vessels subject to this Act are hired according to equal opportunity guidelines."
