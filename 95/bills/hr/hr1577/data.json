Requires that, if cigarettes in such a sale are delivered for transportation to a vehicle registered in a State other than one in which the purchaser resides or does business, a filing also be made in the State in which the vehicle is registered. Requires a person transporting more than 4,000 cigarettes to possess documents showing the name and address of the person or persons assuming liability for applicable taxes. Makes it a Federal offense to transport more than 4,000 cigarettes into a State in violation of State tax law."
