Limits the salaries payable to congressional employees. Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to require the President to transmit to the Congress recommendations with respect to the rates of pay for Members of Congress and certain legislative, judicial and executive branch employees. Revises the procedure whereby changes in rates of pay for Members of Congress take effect. Prohibits the Congress from considering any appropriation bill, budget resolution, or amendment which prevents the payment of pay increases resulting from a pay adjustment deferred under this Act."
