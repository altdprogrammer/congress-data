    "text": "Airport and Aircraft Noise Reduction Act - Title I: Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a single system of measuring noise and the impact of noise on individuals to be used to measure noise at airports and their surrounding areas and to establish land uses for such areas which are compatible with such noise levels. Allows airport operators to submit noise impact maps to the Secretary setting forth the noncompatible uses in each area of the map, a description of the projected aircraft operations during 1985, and the ways in which such operations will affect such map. Requires the revision of such maps when changes in airport operations would create any new noncompatible use in areas surrounding an airport. Authorizes any appropriate State agency to request the Secretary to hold hearings in areas affected by airport noise to determine whether a program for the reduction of the impact of aircraft noise is in the public interest. Stipulates that in the event such a program is required, the airport operator concerned shall submit a noise impact map and a noise compatibility program to the Secretary. Amends the Airport and Airway Development to authorize the Secretary to make grants to qualified airports for noise compatibility planning. Defines \"noise compatibility planning\" as the preparation of noise impact maps and noise compatibility programs under this Act. Sets forth limitation regarding the amounts which may be obligated through such grant program. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1978 and beyond to carry out such grant program. Stipulates that noise compatibility programs filed with the Secretary pursuant to this Act shall include measures proposed by airport operators for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses within the area covered by the operator's noise impact map. Sets forth factors which the Secretary is to rely on in approving noise compatibility programs. Stipulates that the Federal share of an approved program shall be 80 percent of its costs. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1978 and 1979 to carry out such grant program. Requires the Secretary to prepare noise impact maps and noise compatibility programs for specified airports near the District of Columbia. Title II: Increases the appropriations authorized for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970. Title III: Directs the Secretary to publish a list of operators of United States civil subsonic turbojet powered aircraft above a specified weight which do not comply with noise standards prescribed for new subsonic aircraft in regulations issued by the Secretary and in effect on January 1, 1977. Requires such operators to submit to the Secretary a statement that such aircraft will comply with such standards and the method by which such compliance shall be attained, either by retrofitting or replacement. Requires such operators to impose surcharges on rates for carriage of persons or property on noncomplying aircraft and to deposit such amounts in a separate account to pay for retrofitting or replacement costs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants available to operators of noncomplying aircraft when the funds in such account are insufficient to meet retrofitting or replacement costs. Sets forth restrictions relating to the sale or lease of such aircraft. Prohibits the operation of foreign aircraft over a specified take off weight limit within the United States after January 1, 1985, unless such aircraft comply with noise standards prescribed for subsonic aircraft in effect on January 1, 1977. Title IV: Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall be construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to preempt the field relating to aircraft or airport noise."
