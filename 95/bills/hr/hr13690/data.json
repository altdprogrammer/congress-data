Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary postpone publication of such a finding pending a determination by the Commission on whether \"dumping\" is occurring. Decreases the time periods during which the Secretary must complete the investigation of \"dumping\" allegations. Imposes liquidation deadlines upon imported merchandise upon which a special \"dumping\" duty has been imposed. Requires the establishment of a task force for each investigation of \"dumping\" allegations to serve as an intermediary between the Secretary and the industrial and labor groups interested in the investigation."
