    "text": "Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salary Adjustment Amendments Act - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and the Federal Salary Act of 1967 by establishing a Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries for the calendar year 1980 and for each fourth calendar year thereafter to review the rates of pay for positions compensated under the Executive Schedule, and for Members of Congress, judges, justices, commissioners of the Court of Claims and referees in bankruptcy. Directs the Commission to determine the appropriate pay levels and relationships between and among such positions and to report its findings to the President. Requires the President to make specific pay recommendations for positions covered by this Act which shall become effective unless disapproved by Congress under procedures set forth in this Act. Makes such pay rates for Members of Congress effective as of the beginning of the Congress following the Congress during which such rates of pay were recommended by the President. Makes all other effected rates of pay effective at the beginning of the first pay period commencing more than 30 days after the President's recommendation was transmitted to Congress. States that in any year in which pay rates are adjusted pursuant to this Act (which shall occur quadrennially) no annual salary comparability increase shall be permitted."
