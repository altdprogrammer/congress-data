    "text": "Coastal Zone Management Act Amendments - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to redefine energy activities subject to the provisions of the Act to include construction or operation of any energy facilities required for technical or economic purposes. Revises requirements applicable to grants to coastal States under the Act to require that the Secretary of Commerce disburse such grants promptly upon determining the amount of each States' entitlement. Repeals the requirement that grant monies to be used for planning and development of public services be unavailable under other provisions of the Act. Eliminates the requirement that States provide for apportionment of financial assistance to local governments."
