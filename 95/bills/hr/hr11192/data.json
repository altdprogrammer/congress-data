    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Science and Technology with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1005 (Part II)) Recombinant DNA Act - =Title I: Interim Regulation of Recombinant DNA Activities= - Requires all recombinant DNA activities, during the period from the tenth day after the enactment of this Act and ending 24 months thereafter, to be carried out in accordance with the recombinant DNA research guidelines of the National Institutes of Health published in part II of the Federal Register for July 7, 1976. Requires each individual or entity conducting recombinant DNA activities to report in writing to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare respecting such activities. Enumerates actions prohibited by this Act and establishes civil penalties for the commission of such actions. Authorizes inspectors designated by the Secretary, upon presentation of appropriate credentials and notice, to enter and inspect any place in which a recombinant DNA activity is being conducted or in which the inspector has reasonable grounds to believe such activity is being conducted. Authorizes an inspector to detain for a reasonable period of up to 20 days any recombinant DNA or material used in or produced by a recombinant DNA activity which the inspector believes to be violative of the prohibitions enumerated in this Act or to present a significant risk to health or the environment. States that such inspections may be conducted without obtaining a search warrant from a judicial officer before entering any plan to conduct an inspection. Declares that no State or political subdivision may establish or continue in effect any requirement for the regulation of recombinant DNA activities except upon application to and approval of the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to conduct or support on a continuing basis studies designed to assess the risks to health and the environment which may be presented by recombinant DNA activities. Declares that this Act shall not affect the authority of any Executive agency to regulate recombinant DNA activities under any other Act. Stipulates that the Secretary in exercising authority under this Act shall not be deemed to be exercising statutory authority to enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health. Stipulates that all parts of this Title shall expire at the end of two years. =Title II: Commission for the Study of Research and Technology Involving Genetic Manipulation= - Establishes a Commission for the Study of Research and Technology Involving Genetic Manipulation within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Directs the Commission to conduct a study of: (1) Federal policy regarding activities involving the genetic modification of organisms and viruses; and (2) the long-term consequences of the development of a technology capable of accomplishing the genetic modification of organisms and viruses."
