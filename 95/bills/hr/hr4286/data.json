    "text": "Establishes in the Office of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and Office of Youth Camp Safety to be headed by a Director of Youth Camp Safety. Confers upon the Director the primary responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of youth camp safety regulations. Defines, for the purposes of this Act, the term youth camp to mean, among other things, any residential camp, day camp, troop camp, travel camp, trip camp, primitive or out post camp, or Federal camp. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and enforcement of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Director for his approval. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in a United States court of appeals. Authorizes the Director to make grants to States which have in effect to assist such states in training costs, and to States for the development of such plans. Requires the Director to provide consultative services to youth camps in States which do not have approved plans in effect. Prohibits the Director from issuing citations for any violations discovered during such consolidatives visit. Stipulates that a written notice describing such violation must be provided and a reasonable time period provided for abatement of such violation. Permits a citation to issue for failure to abate such violation within the prescribed period. Requires the Director to afford any youth camp director receiving a citation an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with certain requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, and permits any camp director adversely affected by a decision of the Director to appeal such decision to a United States court of appeals. Authorizes the Director to enter and inspect youth camps and examine their records, practices and conditions. Authorizes the Director to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence in making his inspections and investigations. Prescribes penalties for each violation by a youth camp of the standards and requirements imposed by this Act. Grants jurisdiction to the United States district courts, upon a petition from the Director, to restrain any youth camp conditions or activities likely to present an imminent danger. Allows the Director to exempt camps from the requirements of this Act in certain situations, but requires notice of the exemption to parents and campers. Directs the Director to establish within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety. Requires the Director to submit annually to Congress and the President a report on his administration of this Act. Authorizes the Director to request and receive direct by from any department or agency of the Federal Government information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics needed to carry out his functions under this Act."
