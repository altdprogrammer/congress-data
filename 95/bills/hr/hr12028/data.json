Makes Vietnam era veteras eligible for home, condominium, and mobile home loans, and for automatic 60 percent guaranteed home loans. Provides that loans for energy-related and general home improvements to a home owned or occupied by a veteran may bear interest at a rate higher than the rate of interest established by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs (VA) of loans for the purchase of homes. Increases the amount of a home loan which may be guaranteed by the Veterans' Administration from $17,000 to $25,000. Adds the installation of solar heating or cooling, combined solar heating and cooling, and application of a residential energy conservation measure to the list of purposes for veterans home improvement loans guarantees. Revises veterans' mobile home and mobile home lot loans provisions with regard to guarantees and removes the restriction against multiple loan entitlements. Provides a formula for determining the maximum amount available for direct veterans' loans for mobile homes and mobile home lots. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) the responsibility of periodically inspecting manufacturers and making onsite inspections to ensure compliance with mobile home standards established by the Administration. Makes the provisions of this title effective October 1, 1978, except that the authorization for guarantees of loans for the purchase of converted condominiums shall take effect July 1, 1979. =Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Requires the Administrator to conduct, on a continuing basis, a review of default experience with respect to education loans and to report to Congress annually on such review. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and apply criteria to limit eligibility for loans and reduce the loan repayment period. Establishes a plot or interment of allowance of $150 for veterans' buried in certain cemeteries. Authorizes appropriations for five years, beginning fiscal year 1980, for making grants to States for assistance in establishing, expanding, or improving veterans' cemeteries. Stipulates that such grants shall be subject to certain conditions. Allows VA supplied headstones and markers to be made of any material requested by the entitled person provided such material is cost effective and compatible with the national cemetery area. Permits the Administrator to reimburse a person entitled to a headstone or marker for the cost of a non-Government headstone for placement in any cemetery other than a national cemetery, provided the cost is not in excess of the average actual cost of Government headstones. Makes the provisions of this title effective on the date of enactment except for the burial benefits, which shall take effect October 1, 1978."
