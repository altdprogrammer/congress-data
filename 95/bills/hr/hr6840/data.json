Allows the Commission, or any court, in any action alleging that any of the above provisions violates this Act or any of the antitrust Acts, to apply such Acts on any basis other than a per se basis. Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the Commission or any court from applying any antitrust Act on a per se basis to any violations other than those described above. Defines the term \"trademarked private label food product\" for purposes of this Act."
