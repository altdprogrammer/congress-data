    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1082) Discontinues payment of civil service pension annuities to annuitants who become employed as a justice or judge of the United States. Resumes such payments upon resignation or retirement from such reemployment in the same amount. Allows such former employees or former Members of Congress while reemployed as a judge or justice to apply for and be paid the amount by which the lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid. Permits present or former justices or judges or the surviving spouses who voided the right to receive an annuity, having been refunded the lump-sum credit, to redeposit such refund and thereby reestablish eligibility to receive an annuity. Grants to specified annuitants who were unmarried at the time of retiring but who later married before January 8, 1971, the right to irrevocable elect within one year after the effective date of this Act, a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity payable to his or her spouse. Permits an unmarried annuitant, who married between January 8, 1971, and the day before the date one year before the date of the enactment of this Act, one additional year in which to elect a reduced annuity to provide a survivor benefit, provided such annuitant deposits an amount equal to the amount by which his annuity would have been reduced if he had made a timely election for a reduced annuity."
