    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Residual Radioactive Materials Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to enter into agreements with designated States under which the Federal Government would pay up to 100 percent of the costs of: (1) assessing the radiation levels of residual radioactive materials from former uranium ore processing sites in such States; and (2) limiting the risk of exposure of individuals to such radioactive materials. Exempts certain processing sites from the coverage of this Act. Requires the agreements made by the Secretary and such States to include terms providing, among other things, that the Secretary select the appropriate remedial action for limiting the risk of radiation exposure, and that the States acquire ownership to the land upon which the radioactive materials are located. Directs the Secretary to enter into a similar agreement with the Secretary of the Interior and the Indian Tribes for the assessment of radiation levels and performance of remedial action on lands owned by Indians or held in trust for them. Provides for payment of 100 percent of the costs of such agreement. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, to prescribe standards to assure that the public health, safety, and environment are not impaired by the remedial action undertaken pursuant to this Act. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the States, to prepare environmental impact statements for remedial actions taken under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
