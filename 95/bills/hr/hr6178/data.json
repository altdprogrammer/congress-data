Requires that eligible employees of BIA and IHS be considered before other applicants when filling vacancies in other bureaus of Interior and HEW. States that if compelling reasons exist to deny the appointment of an eligible employee entitled to preference under this Act, the appointing officer must file such reasons with the Civil Service Commission. Requires the Commission to rule on the sufficiency of such reasons, and to make the final decision on the appointment in question. States that this Act shall be in effect for three years. Empowers the Civil Service Commission to extend the life of the Act for an additional year with respect to one or both of the departments affected by the Act."
