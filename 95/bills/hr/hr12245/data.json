    "date": "1978-04-19", 
    "text": "Fair Rights for Women Act - Title I: Discrimination In Public Places, In Federally Assisted Programs, and In Federal Employment - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit sex discrimination with respect to (1) public accommodations, (2) federally assisted programs, and (3) discrimination purportedly required by State law or regulation. Authorizes the Attorney General to institute legal proceedings for the relief of sex discrimination in the public facilities of a state, other than schools or colleges. Requires Federal agencies to apply any employment right or benefit equally to both sexes. Empowers the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to enforce such requirement. Title II: Discrimination in Military and Veterans' Affairs - Prohibits the establishment of any requirement with respect to the dependency of a female member of an armed force, or a female veteran, which is not applied to the spouse of a male member of an armed force, or a male veteran. Redefines \"dependent,\" for purposes of armed forces benefits, to repeal the requirement that husbands and unremarried widowers of armed forces personnel, receive or did receive at least one half support from their spouse. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit annual reports to Congress on the status of women in the armed forces. Title III: Social Security Act Amendments - Amends Titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and IV, part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act to eliminate gender-based distinctions in awarding certain benefits under such Titles. Extends social security benefits under Title II of such Act to divorced husbands, surviving divorced husbands, and widowers with minor children on the same bases that such benefits are presently extended to similarly situated females. Reduces the monthly insurance benefits payable to husbands and parents of minor children under Title II by the monthly amounts such individuals receive from a Federal or State retirement plan. Defines \"divorced wife\" or divorced husband\" for purposes of this Act and reduces from 20 to 10 the number of years a divorced spouse must have been married to claim benefits under the former spouse. Permits payment of social security benefits to a husband and wife on the basis of their combined average indexed monthly earnings. Establishes a formula for determining the amount of such benefits and limits that amount to no more than the amount payable to an individual with a maximum benefit and contribution base. Amends Title IV, part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act to eliminate gender-based distinctions in determining exclusions from the requirement that recipients of aid under such program register for manpower services, training, and employment programs established by such Title. Title IV: Discrimination in Certain Income Tax Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow married individuals to base their deduction for contributions to an individual retirement account upon their spouse's compensation if the spouse's compensation is greater than their own earnings. Title V: Study and Review of Sex Discrimination - Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to study and make recommendations to Congress concerning women's social security and civil service retirement benefits, Federal assistance to \"non-public assistance\" child care services, and tax deductions for child and disabled parent care services."
