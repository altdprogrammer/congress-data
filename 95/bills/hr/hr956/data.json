Requires any agreement for such export to meet specified criteria with respect to reprocessing provisions and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Directs the Secretary of State to seek inclusion of such requirements in agreements made prior to this Act. Prohibits issuance of nuclear export licenses unless the recipient country has agreed that such export will not be used for any nuclear explosive device. Specifies conditions under which nuclear materials, exported under such agreements, may be reprocessed."
