Title II: Educational Assistance Program Adjustments - Excludes from the computation, pursuant to the \"85-15\" rule, of the percentage of students in a course who are receiving Government educational assistance those students whose fees are paid by Federal agencies other than the Veterans' Administration. Exempts from the two-year minimum period of operation rule courses offered on or immediately adjacent to a military base which are available to civilians as well as to active duty military personnel and their dependents, but only when such courses are offered outside the United States. Permits waiver of the two-year minimum period of operation rule for courses offered by branches or extensions of specified educational institutions where the Administrator finds it to be in the best interests of the eligible veteran and the Federal Government. Lowers from 30 percent to ten percent the disability rating necessary to qualify a disabled veteran for employment and training assistance. Title III: Effective Date - Makes October 1, 1977, the effective date of this Act."
