Establishes a new program of mortgage protection life insurance, which includes the following provisions: (1) sets the maximum amount of insurance under a policy provided under this Act to no more than $40,000; and (2) expands eligibility to include any veteran entitled to compensation for (a) permanent and total service-connected disability, or (b) the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with residuals of organic disease or injury which so affect the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude locomotion without resort to a wheelchair, and any veteran who establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs that he is unable to obtain commercial life insurance at a standard rate because of his service-connected disability."
