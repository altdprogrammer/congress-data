Requires that miners be informed of rights and obligations under this Act. Establishes procedures for enforcement of mine safety standards under this Act, including the closure of dangerous mine sites by the Secretary of Labor or his representative. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for violation of provisions of this Act. Establishes the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health Commission, as an independent agency, to appoint hearing examiners (to adjudicate disputes under the Act) and to review the decisions of such examiners. Establishes, in the Department of Labor an Office of the Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health to be filled by Presidential appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Creates the Advisory Committee on Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health, to consult with the Assistant Secretary and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on the administration of the Act.
