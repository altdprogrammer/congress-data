Changes from October 1, 1977, to October 1, 1979, the date by which a State is required under Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to establish or designate an authority to establish and insure the enforcement of standards for institutions, foster homes, or group living arrangements in which a significant number of recipients of supplemental security income reside. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to furnish to the States such information about the residences of such recipients as is necessary for the States to establish, maintain, and enforce such standards. Requires the Secretary to pay to the States an amount equal to the sums spent by each State for inspecting such institutions."
