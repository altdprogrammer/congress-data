    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-04", 
    "text": "National Land Resources Act - Declares that topsoil is a valuable, unique and peculiar natural resource upon which future generations will be dependent. Declares that ownership of land carries with it a responsibility not to destroy the topsoil or so intermingle or bury it that it will not be easily and economically accessible for use at a later date. Establishes a National Land Resources Protection Commission. Directs the Commission to establish standards with respect to the stockpiling and replacing of topsoil on all (1) federally-assisted projects, (2) projects on federally-held land, and (3) projects which affect interstate commerce. Prescribes minimum criteria to be included in such standards. Directs the Commission to establish minimum standards to assure that projects covered by this Act will not cause pollution of existing streams, land slides, flooding or substantial changes in the volume of water to be carried by adjacent waterways except where such change is consistent with State or Federal water resource policy. Stipulates that no dirt shall be moved on any project where the moving or covering of topsoil covers an area in excess of 100,000 square feet until a license or letter of approval to do so has been issued by the Commission or by a commission to whom authority has been delegated under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $6,000,000 annually for the administration of this Act."
