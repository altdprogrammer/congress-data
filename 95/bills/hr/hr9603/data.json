    "text": "Provides that certain employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service who are not entitled to Indian preferences shall be entitled to an annuity after completing 25 years of service (or after attaining 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service) if they are separated from the service before 1990, or any later date before 1991 if the later date is necessary for continued effective operations of the Department involved. Provides that employees entitled to Indian preference and military preference shall be retained in preference to employees entitled to only military preference during reductions in force within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Prohibits the appointment of unqualified Indians to any positions under the Indian preference laws. Forbids the application of Indian preference laws to any personnel action respecting an individual if the tribal organization served by the unit in which position exists grants a waiver of those laws. Provides that reassignments of individuals within the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall not be subject to the Indian preference laws where the Commissioner of Indian Affairs determines that the reassignment is necessary to: (1) assure the health or safety of an individual or his family; (2) prevent the deterioration of an individual's operation or of a necessary service to the Indian people; or (3) avoid the displacement of an Indian during a reduction in force. Directs the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to recruit Indians for service within the Bureau, to establish training and career development programs for Indian employees of the Bureau and to provide procedures for coordinating Indian preference programs in a uniform manner throughout the Bureau."
