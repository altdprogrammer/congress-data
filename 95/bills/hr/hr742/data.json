    "text": "Amends the National Labor Relations Act to deem as an unfair labor practice a labor organization's calling, continuing, or resuming a strike in any bargaining unit if a referendum was requested before the strike began and the result thereof has not been certified or if a majority of the employees voting in a referendum elect not to strike or not to continue to strike. Stipulates that a referendum may be requested by (1) a certified representative of employees in any collective bargaining unit whose members have an interest in the outcome of the controversy giving rise to the strike or potential strike; (2) ten percent or more of the members in any such unit; or (3) the employer. States that where an employer files a petition alleging that one or more individuals or organizations have presented claims to be recognized as an exclusive bargaining representative, the National Labor Relations Board shall not require any proof that the petitioner has a reasonable or good faith doubt that the person or persons claiming recognition have the support of the majority of the employees in the collective bargaining unit. Authorizes any person aggrieved by a final Board decision with respect to certification of a collective bargaining representative to obtain review in an appropriate United States court of appeals. Sets forth procedures relative to such appeals."
