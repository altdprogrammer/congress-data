    "text": "Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to require issuers of securities to report only material information to offerees with respect to transactions not involving a public offering. Limits the rulemaking power of the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to prevent the disqualification of certain affiliates of issuers and sellers of restricted securities from the exemption from registration requirements allowed for persons not engaged in the distribution of securities. Exempts a security seller who makes a good faith attempt not to involve any public offering in a transaction from liability to a purchaser. Increases the small offering exemption from $500,000 to $3,000,000. Exempts small business investment companies licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 from the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940."
