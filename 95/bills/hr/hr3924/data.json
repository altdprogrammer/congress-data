Provides that certain non-Indians holding grazing permits shall continue to have grazing permits on transferred land for ten years, without payment of the prescribed fees for the first five years. Stipulates that upon cancellation or relinquishment permits cannot be renewed or reissued. States that receipts relating to said lands acquired by the United States after acquisition of these lands shall be deposited to the credit of the Pueblo of Santa Ana. Declares that such lands shall be exempt from Federal, State and local taxation for so long as they are held in trust by the United States.
