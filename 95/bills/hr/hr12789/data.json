    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt taxicabs from the Federal excise tax on gasoline, diesel and special motor fuels. Defines \"taxicabs\" as land vehicles with a passenger capacity of less than ten adults, including the driver. Defines \"taxicab services\" as nonscheduled passenger land transportation for a fixed fare operated by a person who is licensed by the appropriate authority to provide such services and is not prohibited by any law from doing so. Renders the tax exemption inapplicable to vehicles purchased or manufactured in 1978 or later or vehicles which do not meet fuel economy standards under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to repay to the operator of an eligible taxicab any tax imposed upon the purchase of gasoline or other motor fuels which are exempt from the excise tax under this Act."
