Directs the head of each agency exercising authority under specified programs to assure that special consideration will be given to national community-based organizations in providing employment services and job opportunities pursuant to such programs. Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to direct the Secretary to provide work experience during all months of the year to youth in urban and rural areas. Amends the work incentive program provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to permit a tax credit with respect to wages paid certain previously unemployed employees during the first 12 months of employment."
