Increases the maximum amount which the Corporation is authorized to borrow from the Treasury of the United States. Extends through fiscal year 1990 the authority of the Corporation to issue obligations. Stipulates that the Corporation, in carrying out its duties (1) shall request the Council of the District of Columbia to close any street or alley when required to implement the plan and shall receive title to such property without cost, barring the existence of a reverter to a private landowner and (2) may transfer title and jurisdiction to real property which is to be dedicated to public uses to the United States or District of Columbia. Increases and extends the appropriation authorization for the administrative expenses of the Corporation. Replaces the set dollar authorization for implementation of the development plan with an authorization for such sums as may be necessary."
