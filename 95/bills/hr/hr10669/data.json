    "text": "Special Prosecutor Act - Directs the Attorney General to conduct an investigation upon receiving specific information that any of specific former or present national campaign managers or Federal officials, including the President, Vice President, judges, or Members of Congress, has authorized or engaged in any violation of Federal law other than a petty offense. Requires the Attorney General to report the results of such investigations to a special court to be comprised of three retired circuit judges, and to apply to the court for the appointment of a special prosecutor where warranted. Permits the court to appoint a special prosecutor without an application if (1) it receives information regarding a violation by an official covered by this Act, and (2) it determines that it would be inappropriate for the Department of Justice to investigate the matter. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules and regulations requiring any officer or employee of the Department of Justice to disqualify himself from participation in a particular investigation or prosecution if participation may result in a conflict of interest or appearance thereof."
