    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, in lieu of S. 2915) Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Amendments - Amends the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act to emphasize prevention of alcohol and drug abuse in stating congressional purpose and to expand the focus of the Act to include \"approaches\" to the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse rather than limiting the scope to curricula. Authorizes grants to States and local educational agencies and other nonprofit agencies to establish demonstration projects for determining the most effective methods of alcohol and drug abuse prevention. Requires that funds expended for such grants shall be allotted in proportion to the relative numbers of individuals served within and outside of standard metropolitan statistical areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Establishes the Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education within the Office of Education. Extends the Act for three years and authorizes appropriations to carry out programs under the Act. Requires that funds appropriated for any fiscal year be allotted, to the maximum extent practicable, in proportion to the number of individuals served within and outside of standard metropolitan statistical areas. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 by entitling certain institutions participating in the veterans cost-of-instruction program to payments under this Act in the event that enrollment falls short of meeting the ratio criterion provided such institutions are making reasonable efforts to recruit, enroll, and provide necessary services to veterans."
