    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1978-05-12", 
    "text": "Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act - Title I: National Park System - Designates specified public lands in Alaska to be included as units of the National Park System. Title II: National Wildlife Refuge System - Establishes specified areas in Alaska as units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Title III: National Wild and Scenic Rivers System - Lists rivers in Alaska which shall be wild rivers for purposes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Designates other rivers for study for inclusion as wild and scenic rivers. Title IV: National Forest System Adds specified lands to the Tongass and Chugach National Forest in Alaska. Title V: Designation of Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Area Provisions - Designates as wilderness areas certain areas with the National Park System, and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Designates other areas for study for designation as wilderness areas. Title VI: Subsistence; Fish and Wildlife Management Permits the establishment of subsistence management zones and prescribes conditions under which subsistence uses may be permitted. Title VII: Cooperative Study and Planning Commission - Provides for the establishment of the Alaska Cooperative Study and Planning Commission to study, plan, and make recommendations concerning proposed land and resource uses in Alaska. Title VIII: Implementation of Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and Alaska Statehood Act - Conveys to each Village Corporation for a Native Village all right, title, and interest of the United States to the surface estate in the land and submerged lands under water areas within the township within which such village is located. Lists certain exceptions to such conveyance. Conveys to each Native Corporation and Native Group established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act all lands which they are entitled to receive under such Act. Establishes the Alaska Native Land Bank Program, which will permit a Native Corporation to place up to 90 percent of its undeveloped and unimproved land holdings into an agreement with the State, or the Secretary if the State declines participation. States that such agreements shall be for ten years; with five year renewal periods. Provides that for three years after the date of enactment of this Act, any appropriate Federal district court shall have jurisdiction to hear, consider, and decide any action brought by the State or by a Native Corporation to enforce the provisions of this title. Title IX: Mineral Study, Exploration, and Extraction In Conservation System Units - Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a mineral assessment program and general geologic investigatory program in Alaska. Requires the Secretary to study the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon and other mineral potential of such areas under the Departments' jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary to issue permits for mineral exploration and extraction in conservation areas if consistent with the purposes of such area. Title X: Transportation and Utility Systems on Conservation System Units - Provides that laws which are generally applicable to units of the National Park, Wilderness Preservation, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and Wildlife Refuge Systems regarding rights- of-way for transportation or utility systems, shall apply to units of conservation systems in Alaska. Reaffirms the authority of the Secretary to provide access to wilderness areas for the administration of such areas (including emergency measures involving the health and safety of persons within the areas) consistent with the Wilderness Act. Set forth procedures for the consideration and processing of applications for rights-of-way on public lands within conservation units in Alaska for transportation or utility systems over which the Secretary has no authority. Authorizes the Secretary to grant rights-of-way for certain oil or gas pipelines if he has determined that there is no economically feasible alternative route. Authorizes the Secretary to grant a right-of-way for a transportation or utility system across public lands within a conservation system unit (other than a wilderness area), if an environmental impact statement for that section of the right-of-way crossing such unit would not have been required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Secretary has determined that such right-of-way: (1) would not result in a significant adverse effect on the conservation system unit, and (2) would be compatible with the purposes for which the unit was established and the purposes of this Act. Requires the Secretary to transmit a recommendation to the Congress regarding whether or not the application for a certain right-of way which the Secretary does not have the authority to grant or deny, should be granted. States that prior to making such recommendation the Secretary must determine; (1) whether the approval of such application is in the public interest; (2) whether there is an economically feasible and prudent alternative to granting the right-of-way; and (3) whether the transportation or utility system can be constructed, operated, and maintained in a manner compatible with the purposes of the affected conservation system unit and this Act. Sets forth other items to be transmitted to the Congress by the Secretary with such recommendations. Establishes a procedure for Congressional approval of the Secretary's recommendations. Requires the Secretary to issue a use permit for a right-of-way immediately following the enactment of a joint resolution of congressional approval. Requires payment by the permittee, to the United States, of the fair market value of the right-of-way, unless Congress otherwise directs. Sets forth certain requirements for pipelines which cross wild and scenic rivers. Title XI: General Administrative Provisions - Provides for withdrawal of designated lands from appropriation under mining and mineral leasing laws. Delineates rights of Native Corporations with respect to designated lands. Authorizes the Secretary to establish administrative sites and visitor facilities outside the conservation units. Directs the Secretary to locate such sites and facilities on Native lands where practicable and desirable. Sets forth the authorities of the Secretary in regard to establishing such sites and facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish a local-hire program, under which the Secretary will consider for selection qualified local residents to positions in any of the units, without regard to civil service regulations which require minimum periods of formal training or experience, other preference provisions, or numerical limitations on personnel. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports and recommendations to Congress on such program. Provides for the continued use, operation, and maintenance of (1) existing air and water navigation aids and existing facilities for weather, climate, and fisheries research, where they are located within the conservation system units, and (2) existing facilities for national defense purposes, and related air and water navigation aids, within or adjacent to conservation system units. Title XII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Establishes the Iditarod National Historic Trail, by amending the National Trails System Act. Permits the State of Alaska to donate mineral interests, as well as surface estate lands, to the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate and plan for an information and education center for visitors to Alaska. Title XIII: Appropriations - Authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
