Waives the non-Federal matching share requirement for private nonprofit organizations which are conducting activities pursuant to State or local government contracts or grants. Directs that at least 10 percent of the minimum annual allotment of formula grants to a State be used to assist the State juvenile justice advisory group established pursuant to the State juvenile delinquency plan. Revises guidelines for the composition of such advisory groups and delegates to them certain additional functions. Makes specified amendments in the standards which must be included in a State juvenile justice plan. States that failure to comply within two years with the requirement that juveniles committing noncriminal offenses be placed in shelter facilities rather than in correctional institutions shall result in termination of formula grants and certain other funds unless the Administrator finds substantial compliance and a commitment to achieve full compliance. Eliminates provisions making available the formula grant allotment of a State whose juvenile justice plan fails to comply with mandatory Standards due to neglect to public and private agencies for special emphasis programs. Revises present, and specifies additional, purposes for which assistance may be extended under special emphasis prevention and treatment programs. Eliminates the limit on formula funds which may be used by a State to meet the matching share requirement of certain essential Federal juvenile delinquency programs.

Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for fiscal years 1977-82 to carry out certain provisions and programs of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. Amends the Runaway Youth Act to expand the grant program thereunder to encompass the development of local facilities to meet the needs of all homeless youth. Prohibits a runaway house receiving assistance under such Act from disclosing statistical records profiling the parents and children which it serves to other than specified agencies unless the child involved, as well as his parent, consents. Revises monetary guidelines with respect to which grants and runaway houses are to be given priority. Authorizes the appropriation of specified sums for the runaway house grant program for fiscal years 1977-1982."
