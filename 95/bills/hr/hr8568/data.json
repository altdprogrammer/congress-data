    "text": "National Crude Oil Supply and Transportation Act -- Expresses the intent of Congress that the continuation of a transportation system to deliver Alaskan crude oil to Northern Tier or inland States be accomplished through expedited administrative procedures. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a time schedule for the completion of required environmental impact statements in order to select a crude oil transportation system by February 1, 1978. Establishes criteria to be considered by the Secretary in selecting a transportation route. Establishes procedures for Congressional review and disapproval of the Secretary's decision. Directs the Secretary and other appropriate Federal officials to take all actions necessary to provide rights of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations necessary for the instruction, operation and maintenance of the transportation system approved under this Act. Declares that the actions of Federal officers and agencies under this Act shall not be subject to judicial review by the courts. Allows for claims that: (1) actions under this Act will deny Constitutional rights; and (2) actions taken are beyond the scope of authority conferred by this Act, provided that such claims are filed within 60 days following the date of the challenged action. Vests exclusive jurisdiction to hear such claims in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, acting as a special court. Stipulates that any judicial proceedings should be completed at the earliest possible date. Declares that nothing in this Act shall authorize or imply an exemption from any provision of the antitrust laws."
