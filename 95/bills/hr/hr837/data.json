    "text": "First Amendment Implementation Act - States that, under the Communications Act of 1934, the term \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" shall not be construed to give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction to require the provision of broadcast time to any person for the expression of any viewpoint or otherwise to exercise any power, supervision, or review, over the content or schedule of any program broadcast by licensees, except where the broadcast of such material is otherwise prohibited by law. Repeals the authority of the Commission under such Act to revoke a station license or construction permit for willful or repeated failure of a station to grant or sell broadcast time to a candidate for Federal elective office. Repeals the requirement that a licensee grant equal opportunities to all political candidates to use the licensee's broadcasting station. Repeals the prohibition under such Act against editorializing and support of political candidates by noncommercial educational broadcasting stations."
