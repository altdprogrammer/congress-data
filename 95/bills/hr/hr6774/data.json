    "text": "Makes certain technical and conforming amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965. Specifies that fiscal year 1975 is to be used in determining minimum State allotments under community service and continuing education programs under Title I of the Higher Education Act. Sets forth the procedure to control the determination of making a Basic Grant when full appropriations are not available. Delays until October 1, 1978 the requirement that States make nonprofit higher education institutions eligible to participate in State incentive grant programs. Maintains a State's eligibility for a bonus allotment under student incentive grant programs where the loan insurance program is carried on by a nonprofit private institution or organization. Changes the basis upon which the amounts of advances for reserve funds to State agencies are determined. Sets forth the procedure for the ratable reduction of advances for reserve funds in the case of insufficient funds. Encourages States to reactivate student loan insurance programs that have lapsed by permitting a new advance payment to be made to a State for such a program. Sets forth the criteria under which the Commissioner of Education may issue certificates of Federal insurance in a State with adequate non-Federal programs. Applies limitations placed on loans for first-year students to such students' first academic year of postsecondary education. Specifies that all loans made within any 90-day period be considered as a single loan in determining whether such loan must be multiply disbursed. Utilizes the academic year as the reference point by which to apply the maximum and minimum limitations placed on amounts a State may insure. Eliminates the requirement placed on a State-insured student loan program that a borrower contract the holder of the note after ceasing to be at least a half-time student. Applies the definition, under the Higher Education Act, of the Commissioner's equitable share with respect to Federal reinsurance of student loans to supplemental agreements between the Commissioner and a State or private nonprofit student loan insurance program. Modifies requirements applicable to payment of administrative costs to State and nonprofit private student loan insurance programs activated after the date of enactment of the Education Amendments of 1976. Authorizes the Commissioner to determine the period of Federal interest in an academic facility which has been reconstructed or renovated with Federal grants or loans. Permits funds available for academic facility reconstruction or renovation to be used on graduate and undergraduate facilities without regard to whether such funds increase or create enrollment capacity, health care capacity, or continuing education programs. Defers applicability of effective dates of various changes implemented by the Education Amendments of 1976. Stipulates that the definition of institution of higher education, as revised by the Education Amendments of 1976, shall not be interpreted so as to terminate the eligibility of any institution of higher education. Extends authorizations of appropriations for foreign studies and language development programs through fiscal year 1979. Extends the time within which the Commissioner must submit a report on advisory council activities."
