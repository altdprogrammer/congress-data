    "text": "Nursing Home Reform Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize a deduction for amounts paid during the taxable year by the taxpayer for nursing home expenses for an individual if such individual is a dependent of the taxpayer in all respects except the receipt of at least half of his support from such taxpayer. Permits the payment of supplemental security income to residents in nonmedical shelter care facilities in any State if such State certifies that the residents are ambulatory, needing only minimum supervision, and that the amount of State supplementation is not less than $100 per resident per month. Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to redefine the term \"skilled nursing facility\" to require that such facilities, in order to qualify under Title XVIII, provide the services set forth in this Act. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a review of State plans approved under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act at least once a year to determine each State's compliance with and the quality of the administration of its plan. Directs the Secretary to establish a rating system for nursing homes participating in the programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act. States that whoever shall offer, solicit, receive, or accept any consideration as compensation or inducement for referring patients, clients, or customers to any person for purposes of Titles XVIII and XIX shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Requires nursing facilities to provide a program to insure the integrity of patients' accounts, moneys, or valuables and to insure that they are not mingled with those belonging to the facility. Specifies that the Secretary shall pay to the States an amount equal to 100 percent of the sums expended in the enactment of, conversion to, and enforcement of, new enforcement tools short of nursing home licensure revocation. Allows beneficiaries to bring suit for specific performance in any Federal district court without reference to the $10,000 jurisdictional amount. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to any nonprofit organization, church, or association of churches to meet all or a part of the cost of construction or rehabilitation of a home which will be owned and operated by such church, organization, or association. Authorizes the Secretary to make interest reduction payments under specified circumstances with respect to a mortgage covering repair or rehabilitation of a nursing home in order to correct physical deficiencies and comply with Federal minimum standards. Establishes a program of grants to any church, association of churches, or other nonprofit organization to meet all or part of the cost of planning, developing, constructing, or rehabilitating a nursing home owned by such entity in black and other minority areas where there is a demonstrated shortage of nursing home beds. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President submit to the Congress an action plan which would provide a suitable multiagency plan for dealing with nursing home abuses. Authorizes the President to call a White House Conference on Long-Term Care in 1978, in order to develop recommendations for action in establishing a national policy with respect to the needs of disabled Americans with primary emphasis on the physically and mentally impaired aged."
