Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to recompute, in accordance with the method set forth in this Act, the primary insurance amount of an individual who has wages or self-employment income for a year after 1978 for any part of which he is entitled to OASDI benefits. States that the primary insurance amount to be used after such recomputation shall be the larger of the two amounts."
