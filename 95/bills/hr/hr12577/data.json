Rept. 95-1176) Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act - Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1979 for expenses of the Office of Safety, State safety programs, expenses of the Federal Railroad Administration, and for conducting safety research and development programs. Sets forth limitations on the use of such funds. Amends the Hours of Service Act to prescribe maximum on-duty and minimum off-duty hours for signal system employees. Defines \"designated terminal\" under such Act. Removes the authority of the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate rail accidents. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct an evaluation of the safety and efficiency of rail transportation from which rules, regulations, orders and standards relating to maximum size, weight, and length of railroad cars and trains issued by the Secretary shall be derived. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress within two years after the date of enactment of this Act the results of a study on the effect of the exclusive ownership and control of rights-of-way by railroads on the safety and efficiency of rail transportation."
