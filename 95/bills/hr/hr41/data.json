    "text": "Requires charitable organizations which solicit, by any means, the remittance of a contribution by mail to include with such solicitation: (1) the legal name and principal address of the organization; (2) the purpose of the solicitation and intended use of the contribution; (3) the obligation of the organization to furnish the information required by this Act; and (4) the percentage of all such contributions remaining for direct application to charitable purposes, after deducting total administrative costs, during the most recent complete fiscal year, or in some cases the fiscal year preceding such fiscal year. Directs that all of the above information be transmitted, whether in writing or by radio or television, conspicuously in a non-technical, readily understandable manner. Requires that such organization furnish, upon request, such audit reports, accounts, or other information as the Postal Service may require to establish or verify the information included in the solicitations. Requires such organizations to furnish within 30 days to anyone who has been solicited and so requests, pertinent financial information reasonably sufficient to verify any information included in the solicitation. Sets forth the method by which such organizations with outside income may distribute administrative costs. Exempts from these requirements: (1) membership organizations when soliciting their own members; (2) schools, colleges, and universities when soliciting their students, alumni, faculty, governing boards, committees, or family members of such individuals; and (3) charitable organizations authorized by and exclusively making expenditures to a school, college, or university when soliciting such individuals."
