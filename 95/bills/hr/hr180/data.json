Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. States that local educational agencies may receive grants under this Act only upon the determination of the Commissioner of Education that the local agency has adopted and is implementing a plan to reduce crime and increase the safety and security of the students, employees, and facilities of its schools. Sets forth specified measures to be included in such a plan, including: (1) the provision of additional staff members; (2) planning and evaluation activities; and (3) minor alterations of school plants and facilities."
