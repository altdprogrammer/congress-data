Title V: Reporting Requirements for Sales of Agricultural Commodities - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1970 to require rapid reporting to the Secretary of Agriculture of large export sales. Title VI: General Provisions - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture: (1) to implement this Act as expeditiously as possible; and (2) to transmit annual reports to Congress on Department of Agriculture activities including those of Agricultural Trade Offices, in developing foreign markets for United States agricultural commodities."
