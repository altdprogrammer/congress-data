Lists the powers and duties of such Administration, including: (1) to establish and administer a program of voter registration by mail; and (2) to collect and publish information concerning elections in the United States. States that a person is a qualified elector in a Federal Election if such person meets state law requirements of the State in which such person will vote except that such state must provide for qualification of such voters not later than 30 days prior to any Federal election. Requires the Administration to prepare voter registration forms and provide for their distribution. Authorizes the Postal Service to distribute voter registration materials postage free. Authorizes the Administration to reimburse States for the costs of processing registration forms required by this Act. Authorizes the Administration to secure the assistance of State officials when a Federal election is held in a State. Requires such officials to report to the Administration whenever they have reason to believe that unqualified persons are attempting to register to vote and request the assistance of the Administration to prevent fraudulent registration. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in the appropriate United States District Court to enjoin fraudulent registration and sets criminal penalties for fraudulent registration. Provides that any State that adopts the provisions of the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955 with respect to any category of its electors shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this Act and is eligible for payments of financial assistance pursuant to this Act."
