    "text": "Fairness in Labor- Management Relations Act - Repeals provisions of the National Labor Relations Act which permit employers and labor representatives to enter into a contract conditioning employment on union membership. States that a selected labor representative shall represent only those employees, selecting it and that nothing shall preclude any individual or group of individuals from entering into a separate contract of employment, the terms of any collective bargaining agreement notwithstanding. Deems an unfair labor practice a labor organization's calling, continuing, or resuming a strike in any bargaining unit if a referendum was requested before the strike began and the result thereof has not been certified or if a majority of the employees voting in a referendum elect not to strike or not to continue to strike."
