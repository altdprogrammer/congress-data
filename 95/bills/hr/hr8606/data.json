Authorizes any State to apply to the Secretary for program planning and operating grants for nongame fish and wildlife conservation programs. Establishes limitations on the amount of such grants and the procedures for allocation among States. Requires each Federal department and agency with management authority over land and water resources to review its existing programs to determine the feasibility of including conservation measures for nongame fish and wildlife within such lands or waters. Authorizes such departments and agencies to enter into cooperative agreements with designated States to carry out such programs. Authorizes appropriations for the grants established under this Act."
