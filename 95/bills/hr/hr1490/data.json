    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-06", 
    "text": "Requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, to reopen for 30 days the period during which insurance or reinsurance applications may be made by persons in counties in which the Secretary of Agriculture determines a state of emergency exists with respect to insurable crops. Stipulates that terms, conditions, and premium rates shall be the same as those applicable to similarly situated applicants prior to the most recent closing period for the crop to be insured. Directs the Treasury of the United States to reimburse the Corporation for such insurance issued. States that future adjustments in premium rates are not to take into account actuarial data arising from insurance issued during this reopening period. Terminates this Act one year after enactment."
