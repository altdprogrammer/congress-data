Authorizes the Secretary, in the case of any interruption of five days or more, to: (1) activate and direct vessels of the national defense reserve fleet to provide such transportation; (2) request any officer, department, or instrumentality of the Federal Government to make available, on a nonreimbursable basis, personnel, services, or facilities for use in providing such transportation; or (3) to commence a civil action in the appropriate Federal court for an order to terminate such interruption. Authorizes Federal courts to grant such an order if such order is necessary to assure the provision of essential maritime transportation and no practicable alternative to such an order is available."
