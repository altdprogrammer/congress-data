    "text": "Foreign Crimes Act - Renders any national or citizen of the United States who, while serving with, employed by, or accompanying the United States armed forces, commits an act outside the United States and the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction (1) during the performance of official duties, (2) within military installations or area of operation, or (3) against a member of the armed forces or a U.S. citizen or national employed by or accompanying the armed forces which would constitute a Federal crime if committed within the United States or special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, liable for prosecution of a like offense against the United States. Stipulates that such liability shall in no way deprive military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders which may by law be tried by such tribunals. Sets forth standards and procedures for the apprehension of United States nationals and citizens serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces outside the United States. States that any such national or citizen may be removed from a foreign country for purpose of standing trial in the United States if, after he has been given opportunity for a hearing, it is found that there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a Federal offense. Specifies procedures for removal hearings. Authorizes the delivery for trial of a United States national or citizen to the authorities of the foreign country in which he is present and serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces. Sets forth standards and procedures for search warrants with respect to property stolen or embezzled by, or intended for use or used in the commission of a criminal offense by, military personnel or persons accompanying the armed forces. Specifies time limits for the confinement of persons apprehended under this Act. Subjects the provisions of this Act to any applicable treaty, agreement, or accepted rule of customary international law."
