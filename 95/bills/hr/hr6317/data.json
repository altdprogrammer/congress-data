    "text": "Broadcast License Renewal Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to set the term of a broadcast station license, or renewal, at five years. Provides that any license granted may be renewed upon its expiration, if the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the renewal of such license. Allows appeals from decisions and orders of the Commission to be taken to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such broadcast facility is located. Sets guidelines for expeditious action on applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses by limiting material required to be filed. Requires the Commission to examine the renewal process and report within six months on methods of reducing and consolidating filings and supporting documents."
