    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1019) Restores Federal recognition to the Wyandotte, Ottawa, and Peoria Tribes of Oklahoma. Repeals the three Acts of August 1-3, 1956, which terminated the Federal relationship with these tribes. Reinstates all rights and privileges of each such tribe under Federal treaty, statute, or otherwise which was lost because of termination. Declares that nothing in this Act shall diminish any such rights or privileges enjoyed by each such tribe which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. Declares that nothing in this Act shall alter any contractual or property rights or obligations. Recognizes the Medoc Indian Tribe of Oklahoma as a tribe of Indians residing in Oklahoma, and extends the provisions of the Act of June 26, 1936, to such tribe and its members. Excludes the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma from the provisions of the Act of 1954, which terminated the Klamath Tribe of Oregon, except in the case of sharing the proceeds of any claim against the United States. Sets forth the criteria for membership of the Modoc Indian Tribe of Oklahoma. Extends the Act of June 26, 1936, to the Ottawa and Peoria Tribes. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to assist them in reorganizing under such Act. Confirms the validity of the organization of the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma under such Act. Declares that the restoration of the Ottawa, Peoria, and Wyandotte Tribes and the organization of the Modoc Tribe satisfies the requirement that these tribes be restored to Federal recognition before they have any right or interest in the lands held in trust for them by the United States. Entitles these tribes to participate in all programs and services provided in all programs and services provided to Indians in their status as Indians."
