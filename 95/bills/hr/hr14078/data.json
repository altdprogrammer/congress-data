Title I: Amendments to the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 - Specifies that Federal expenditures not exceed 20 percent of the estimated gross national product. Permits any additional estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations necessary for the support of the Government and justified by a compelling national need. Authorizes tax proposals required to reduce receipts to no more than 20 percent of the estimated gross national product for the ensuing year. Allows for any revisions necessary in the estimated gross national product. Title II: Amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 - Requires that the contents of the first concurrent resolution of the budget be separated into two titles, specifying the contents of each title. Prescribes a two-step process for the consideration of amendments to such budget resolution by which amendments to the first title must be considered and disposed of prior to the consideration of amendments to the second title."
