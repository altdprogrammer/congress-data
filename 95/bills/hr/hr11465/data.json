Sets forth the authorized end strength level for active duty personnel and the average military training student load for the Coast Guard for such fiscal year. Amends the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980, to provide financial assistance for State boating safety programs. Authorizes the Coast Guard to enter into a long term lease for the purpose of acquiring land on the Quillayute Indian Reservation in the State of Washington in order to relocate the Quillayute River Coast Guard Station. Exempts from Coast Guard loadline requirements certain cannery or fishing tender vessels used in Oregon, Washington or Alaska on which construction began, or for which conversion began, or for which conversion was contracted, before January 1, 1980, so long as such conversion is completed by January 1, 1983. Exempts from Coast Guard inspection until January 1, 1983, certain vessels of not more than 5,000 gross tons used in the processing or assembling of fishery products in the fisheries of the States of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Requires the Coast Guard, within 180 day of enactment of this Act, to evaluate and make recommendations on the adequacy of existing oilspill cleanup procedures, safeguards, and capabilities on the Columbia River."
