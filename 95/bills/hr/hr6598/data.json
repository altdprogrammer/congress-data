    "date": "1977-04-25", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to revise pesticide registration procedures under such Act to allow for variations in costs imposed upon applicants for required tests dependent upon size of market interest. Authorizes non-disclosure of certain test information where deemed to constitute a trade secret. Stipulates that the identity of inert ingredients of pesticides be disclosed only where (1) a hazard is posed to the public or (2) disclosure would not be likely to harm the registrant's competitive position. Establishes special procedures governing registration of pesticides substantially similar to currently registered pesticides without adherence to full registration requirements imposed by the Act. Authorizes conditional registration of pesticides containing previously untested active ingredients for a period of time sufficient for the generation of ample test data. Establishes procedures for cancellation of pesticides registered under the special procedures contained in this Act. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to permit continued sale and use of existing stocks in such circumstances. Authorizes the appropriation of $65,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 to carry out the purposes of the Act."
