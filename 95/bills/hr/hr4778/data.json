Stipulates that programs shall provide for technical assistance and practical demonstration in the agricultural, commercial, residential, and small business sectors. Requires that the national program permit States to establish technical support institutes at colleges or universities as designated by the Governor of each State. Stipulates that such program shall be implemented in a manner designed to minimize conflict with existing services in the private sector of the economy. Establishes procedures and criteria for the development of State plans for implementing the provisions of this Act. Allows for Federal development of plans for States in which an acceptable plan has not been submitted. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to develop a comprehensive program and plan for coordination of Federal energy education and information dissemination programs. Stipulates that such plan shall detail procedures for assessing the energy efficiency of various Federal programs. Establishes a National Energy Extension Service Advisory Board to conduct a continuing review of the programs developed under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Prescribes a formula for allocation of such funds to the States."
