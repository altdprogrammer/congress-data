    "text": "Judicial Tenure Act - Establishes a Council on Judicial Tenure. Requires the Council to receive and investigate each written complaint by any person concerning a Justice or judge of the United States and to determine whether the ground specified in this Act for removal of a Justice or judge from office or for censure or involuntary retirement of a Justice or judge, exist. Stipulates that if, after a preliminary inquiry by the Chairman, any such complaint is found to be frivolous, unwarranted, or insufficient in law or fact, the Council may dismiss such compliant. Requires that whenever the Council orders an investigation or hearing with respect to the fitness of any Justice or judge to continue in office, it shall provide not less than thirty days notice to such Justice or judge or the date on which any hearing is to be conducted. Sets forth the duties of the Judicial Conference with reference to proceedings relating to removal, censure, and involuntary retirement of a Justice or judge of the United States. Authorizes the conference or a committee of nine judges to order any judge of the United States who is the subject of such inquiry to cease the exercise of any judicial powers or prerogatives pending disposition of the inquiry. Authorizes the Conference or committee in all cases brought before it, by majority vote (1) to order the censure of any Justice or judge whose conduct is found to be inconsistent with the good behavior required by the Constitution; (2) to order the removal of any such Justice or judge from office; (3) to order the involuntary retirement of any Justice or judge in accordance with this Act; and (4) to dismiss or remand to the Council any such case. Directs the Supreme Court to review orders of the Judicial Conference upon the petition of any aggrieved justice or judge."
