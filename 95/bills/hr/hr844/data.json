    "text": "Requires that an individual who refuses to testify before or supply information to a Federal court or grand jury, a Federal agency, or either House of Congress or committee thereof on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination, consent to any court order compelling such testimony or such production of information and, in cases in which such an order issues, be given transactional immunity. Requires the affirmative vote of 12 jurors for the issuance of an order compelling testimony before a Federal grand jury. Adds to the present prerequisites for the issuance of an order compelling testimony before Congress a finding that testimony or other information sought is necessary to the public interest. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to Congress and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts with respect to requests for orders to compel testimony and the number of arrests, indictments and convictions which resulted from such orders."
