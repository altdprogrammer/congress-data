Establishes a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each alien of a violation occurs within two years after the service of a citation.

Provides that one who is assessed a civil penalty and thereafter violates this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction punished by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by one year imprisonment, or both, for each alien in respect to whom any violation of this Act occurs. Permits the Attorney General to adjust the status any illegal alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if such alien has been continuously physically present in the United States since June 30, 1070, and who on June 30, 1977, is the spouse, parent, son, daughter, brother, or sister of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or whose departure from the United States would result in unusual hardship. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose to the Attorney General the name and most recent address of any illegal alien who is receiving assistance under the Social Security Act. Allows the Attorney General to deport any alien who has become a public charge within five years after entry from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen after entry."
