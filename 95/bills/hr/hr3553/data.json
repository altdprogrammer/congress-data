Rept. 95-1667) Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, through the Internal Revenue Service, to enter into training and technical assistance agreements with private or public nonprofit agencies and organizations to prepare volunteers to provide tax counseling assistance for elderly individuals aged 60 and over in the preparation of their Federal income tax returns. Authorizes reimbursement to volunteers for transportation, meals, and other expenses incurred by them in training or providing counseling assistance. Exempts the amounts received by volunteers as reimbursement for such expenses from income and social security taxes, except to the extent that a charitable contribution or other deduction is claimed for these expenses. Authorizes the Secretary to provide the volunteers with preferential access to Internal Revenue Service taxpayer service representatives and to make available technical information and material needed for their use. Authorizes such appropriations as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this program."
