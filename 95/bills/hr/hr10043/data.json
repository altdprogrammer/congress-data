Permits the President, either House of Congress, a representative of an employee or organization, or other interested party to request that the Secretary of Labor determine whether a product: (1) was produced abroad under labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of a minimum standard of living for workers; and (2) is impairing domestic labor of the communities. Authorizes the President to take appropriate action if it is found that the product is in competition with domestic goods under such circumstances."
