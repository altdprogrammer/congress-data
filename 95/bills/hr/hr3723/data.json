    "text": "Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act - Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1974 to extend benefits thereunder to include individuals filing initial claims which are effective earlier than January 1, 1978, and weeks of unemployment prior to March 31, 1978. Sets the total amount of emergency compensation payable to any individual for weeks of unemployment which begin after March 28, 1977, at the same amount payable during a five percent period, as defined by such Act. Declares ineligible for further emergency benefits and subject to prosecution any individual who knowingly makes a false statement of, or failed to disclose, a material fact which misrepresentation resulted in overpayment of emergency benefits. Authorizes a State to require repayment of excess emergency benefits to the appropriate State agency in the case of individuals who received benefits to which they were not entitled. Permits a State to waive such repayment if it determines that the excess payment was made without fault of the recipient and such repayment would be inequitable and contrary to good conscience. Sets forth guidelines relative to repayment of excess benefits. Directs the Secretary of Labor to arrange for modification of State emergency compensation agreements to reflect the revisions in the emergency unemployment compensation program made by this Act."
