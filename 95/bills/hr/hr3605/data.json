States that in order to be eligible for benefits a family must include at least one individual who is either a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and have a countable income of no more than is authorized for benefit payments pursuant to this Act. Specifies that the amount of benefits paid shall be $2,400 a year for the first adult in a family, $1,200 a year for each additional adult, and $550 a year for each dependent child under the age of 18. Stipulates that such amount shall be reduced by the amount of the family's countable income. Sets forth a formula for determining a family's countable income. Requires that every employable individual who is a member of an eligible family shall, as a condition to receiving benefits, register for services, training, and employment in a work incentive program. Directs that all existing Federal public assistance and welfare programs be replaced by this Act."
