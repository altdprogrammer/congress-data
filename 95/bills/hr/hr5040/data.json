    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendment, S. Rept. 95-99) Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1977, to increase the authorization of appropriations to the Department of State for fiscal year 1977 for international organizations and conferences, and migration and refugee assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of State to use appropriated funds for emergency assistance, including medical attention and dietary supplements, for U.S. citizens who are incarcerated abroad. Amends the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926: (1) to repeal the authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1977 for purchase or construction of such buildings in Africa, the American Republics and East Asia; (2) to decrease such appropriations for buildings in Europe, facilities for the United States Information Agency, and facilities for agricultural and defense attache housing; (3) to increase the authorization for appropriations for buildings in the Near East and South Asia; and (4) to authorize appropriations for facilities of the United States Agency for International Development for fiscal year 1977. Stipulates that the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the delegations to the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group, the Mexico-United States Interparliamentary Group, the North Atlantic Treaty Parliamentary Conference, and the Conference on Interparliamentary Union be a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, in the case of the Senate delegation, and be a member of the International Relations Committee in the case of the House delegation. Increases from 18 to 24 the size of the U.S. delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly. Requires that any U.S. department or agency which enters into any international agreement on behalf of the United States transmit the text of such agreement to the Department of State not later than 20 days after such agreement has been signed."
