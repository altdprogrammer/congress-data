    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 95-345) Grants to the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service, under the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976, discretion as to the transactions and processes about which he shall require agencies and persons subject to the official inspection or weighing of grain to maintain complete and accurate records. Reduces the amount of fees paid for inspection or weighing from 100 percent to 50 percent of the costs of direct inspection or weighing, or the direct supervision of personnel performing such functions, by the field office personnel of the Federal Grain Inspection Service. Establishes a temporary advisory committee to provide advice to the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service with respect to the implementation of the Grain Standards Act of 1976. Excludes persons operating under a contract with the Service from performing appeal inspections or weighings at Canadian ports. Permits the Secretary of Agriculture to delegate authority to the Service to perform related functions for grain and similar commodities and products thereof under other statutes administered by the Department of Agriculture. Amends specified provisions of the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976 to: (1) delete the general exception to the provision limiting the number of official agencies for inspection or weighing to one for any geographic area; (2) authorize the Administrator to make exceptions to the general prohibition against the inspection by an official agency of grain samples not physically located within the geographical area assigned to such agency; and (3) provide for the collection of reasonable fees to cover the estimated costs to the Service incident to the testing of inspection and weighing equipment. Prohibits any person from knowingly making any false representation that any weighing service under such Act has been performed. Extends the deadline dates for submission to the appropriate Committees of Congress of reports on specified studies being conducted regarding the present grain inspection and weighing system. Directs the Administrator to consider certain factors relating to a possible conflict of interest before delegating authority to perform an official inspection or supervision of weighing under the Act. Prohibits anyone acting under a license to perform official functions under the United States Grain Standards Act from certifying the subclass of Hard Red Winter wheat on the basis of color or the basis of kernel content or percentage of dark, hard and vitreous kernels in such wheat."
