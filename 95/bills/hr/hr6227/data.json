Provides such assistance to eligible persons who either: (1) need financial assistance to maintain their livestock operations throughout the period of an emergency or (2) have sold or substantially reduced such operations as a result of emergency conditions, and will be able to obtain (with the Federal assistance) private financing in reestablishing such operations."
