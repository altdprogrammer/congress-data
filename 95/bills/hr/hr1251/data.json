Title II: - Revises the rate of interest for disaster loans made by the Small Business Administration under the Small Business Act to a rate not exceeding the average annual interest rate on all interest bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt as computed at the end of the fiscal year next preceding the date of the loan. Title III: - Authorizes the Administration, under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contracts for the planning, design, installation or financing of pollution control facilities. Sets forth restrictions governing such guarantees and requires the Administration to fix a uniform annual fee for such guarantees. Allows the Administrator to require a lessee to hold a specified amount in escrow to be available in case of default. Creates a separate fund within the Treasury for guarantees under this Act."
