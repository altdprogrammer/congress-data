Establishes a national program to guarantee a minimum adequate income for all qualified residents of the United States. Establishes eligibility requirements for such program. Sets the amount of annual benefit for any eligible individual at one-half of the applicable guarantee level as defined in this Act, reduced by one-half of the amount of such individual's income. Specifies that the guarantee level shall be established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor utilizing the most recent information and data which may be available on costs, incomes, budget levels, and consumption patterns, and shall take into account variations in consumption patterns as between different areas and regions and as between families of different sizes and compositions. States that \"income,\" for purposes of this Act, includes all earned and unearned income. Requires every individual eligible for benefits to register for services, training, and employment in a work incentive program established under the Work Incentive Program of Title IV of the Social Security Act. Makes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare responsible for the administration of this title and the program of benefits established by this title. Imposes a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both upon anyone found guilty of fraud in connection with determining rights under this title. Abolishes specified public assistance programs under the Social Security Act and the Food Stamp Act of 1964."
