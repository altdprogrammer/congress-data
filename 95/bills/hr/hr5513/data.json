    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals an a income tax deduction for amounts paid into an employee's tax-exempt retirement trust, or for an annuity contract. Limits the allowable deduction to 15 percent of the individual's gross income, or $1,500, whichever is less, minus a specified portion of the employer's contributions and, in the case of employees exempt from self-employment, FICA or Railroad Retirement Act taxation, the amount of FICA tax liability they would have paid if they were not exempt. Limits the deduction, in the case of employees covered by exempted government plans, to employees whose employers have elected to meet the Internal Revenue Code's criteria for qualified pension plans."
