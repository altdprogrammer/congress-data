    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to identify and monitor abandoned hazardous waste sites. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States which submit programs for the maintenance and reclamation of abandoned hazardous waste sites where such programs are approved under rules promulgated by the Administrator to protect the public health, safety, and the environment. Authorizes States, pursuant to approved State programs, to enter, study and acquire any land adversely affected by hazardous waste at abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites and to do all things necessary to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent such adverse effects if such action is required in the public interest. Specifies conditions under which a State may acquire such lands. Authorizes the sale of such acquired lands after restoration and reclamation has been accomplished where such lands are deemed to be suitable for specified uses. Directs a State to record a lien against lands not acquired by the State for moneys expended to restore, reclaim or prevent adverse effects of hazardous waste disposal on such lands. Authorizes the Administrator to designate sites for new hazardous waste disposal sites upon a finding that such sites will be safe and environmentally sound. Requires the Administrator to consult with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and to take into account results of studies and investigations of such sites initiated under agreements between the Administrator and NAS before designating such sites. Establishes a fund for the maintenance and reclamation of abandoned sites. Provides that fees collected from permit holders, based upon the volume of hazardous waste accepted by such persons, shall form the basis of such fund. Stipulates that half of such fees collected from permit holders of new hazardous waste sites shall be paid into interest-bearing site maintenance accounts to provide for periodic payments for maintenance, care and reclamation of such sites when they cease active operation. Requires permit holders to submit a statement of the volume of waste received during the applicable fee period. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with volume reporting requirements. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and implement programs for maintenance and reclamation of such sites in the event a State fails to receive program approval within one year of enactment of this Act, and stipulates that such Federal programs shall remain in effect until the approval of a State program. Authorizes the Administrator to provide assistance in specified emergencies caused by the release into the environment of any pollutant or other contaminant associated with a hazardous waste facility. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000, and any sums necessary to maintain that level, for a contingency fund to carry out such emergency assistance. Imposes liability upon an owner or operator of such facility for such discharges for the actual costs incurred by the United States in such emergency cleanup operations. Makes necessary technical and conforming amendments to the Solid Waste Disposal Act."
