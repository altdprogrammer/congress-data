Prohibits any Federal agency from inducing such transportation through withholding or threatening to withhold Federal financial assistance. Provides that no person who, by reason of any Federal court order in effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act, is required to provide such transportation shall be so required on or after that date. States that any case in which such order was granted shall be reopened on the motion of any party."
