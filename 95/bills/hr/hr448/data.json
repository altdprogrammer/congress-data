    "text": "Equal Employment of the Handicapped Act - Title I: Equal Employment Opportunity for the Handicapped - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include as an unlawful employment practice discrimination on the basis of handicap. Title II: Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to include disabled persons on the Interagency Committee on Handicapped Employees. Sets forth procedures through which handicapped individuals who believe that they have been subjected to employment discrimination by a Federal agency, who believe that a Federal contractor has failed to comply with its obligation to take affirmative action to employ qualified handicapped individuals, or who believe that they have been subjected to discrimination under any program receiving Federal financial assistance may file complaints with the Civil Service Commission, the Secretary of Labor, or the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, respectively, and have such complaints heard by ad hoc arbitration panels. Requires that a contractor have in effect a program to take affirmative action to employ handicapped persons in order to be eligible for Federal contracts in excess of $2,500. Title III: Employment Placement Services for the Handicapped - Directs State agencies which are responsible for the administration of State laws for vocational rehabilitation of physically handicapped persons to provide assistance to handicapped individuals seeking employment through certain State employment agencies."
