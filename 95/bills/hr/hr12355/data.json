Rept. 95-1089 (Pt II)) Authorizes the appropriation of a specified sum for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for fiscal year 1979. Allocates the amount authorized to named programs of the Commission. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require any person proposing to enter into an arrangement with the Commission for the conduct of research, development, evaluation activities, or for technical and management support services to furnish such information to the Commission as will allow a determination as to the existence or absence of a conflict-of-interest. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Commission to establish a five-year program for funding public participation in Commission proceedings. Requires that a report on the impact and effectiveness of such program be submitted to Congress by the Commission on or before the end of the fourth year of funding. Sets forth criteria for determining whether an applicant is eligible for an award of all or part of the costs of participation in any Commission proceeding. Makes any decision of the Commission concerning such awards subject to review in court to the same extent as any other Commission decision. Lists exceptions which United States courts shall have no jurisdiction. Directs the Commission to propose and adopt regulations to implement such award program."
