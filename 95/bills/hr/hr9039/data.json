    "text": "Veterans Health Care Amendments Act - Requires the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to furnish initial readjustment professional counseling (including a general mental and psychological assessment) for any veteran with readjustment problems who requests such aid within four years after his discharge or release from service, or within two years after enactment of this Act, whichever is later. Requires further mental health services on an outpatient basis if a physician employed by the Veterans' Administration determines on the basis of initial counseling that such services are necessary for the veteran's successful readjustment. Directs the Chief Medical Director to provide for the training of professional, paraprofessional, and lay personnel necessary to carry out such programs. Directs the Administrator to ensure that all potentially eligible veterans are advised of such potential eligibility. Authorizes the Administrator to provide a preventive health care program to ensure the best possible health care for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Directs the Administrator to provide for a health maintenance pilot program to demonstrate the medical advantages and cost-effectiveness of furnishing comprehensive preventive health care services to veterans with varied types and degrees of service-connected disabilities. Requires a comprehensive annual report to Congress on such programs. Requires the Administrator to carry out programs providing inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services on a nationwide basis to eligible veterans suffering from alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disabilities. Directs the Administrator to assist the Secretary of Labor in providing veterans receiving such treatment with appropriate job and training opportunities. Requires the Administrator, when an applicant for such treatment has received a less than honorable discharge from the armed services, to advise such applicant of his right to apply for review and correction of such discharge. Requires the provision of such services to eligible veterans who are charged with or convicted of any criminal offense and who are not confined and not required to participate in such a treatment program; and permits provision of such services, under specified conditions, to eligible veterans similarly charged or convicted, if a court does require participation in such a program. Allows a member of the active armed services with alcohol or drug problems to transfer to any Veterans' Administration facility for treatment within the last 30 days of such member's tour of duty. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and the Administrator to coordinate the Professional Standards Review program carried out under part B of title XI (General Provision) of the Social Security Act and the comparable programs carried out by the Department of Medicine and Surgery to assess the quality of patient care in Veterans' Administration health care facilities. Requires the Chief Medical Director, through the Administrator, to report to Congress on the effectiveness of such coordination. Requires the Chief Medical Director to report to Congress, not later than three months after the end of each fiscal year, on all activities in which he or a designee, as a representative of the Veterans' Administration, has participated in an advisory or coordinating capacity with respect to programs carried out by the executive branch."
