    "text": "Amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to increase the maximum amount of acreage which may be leased to a single person, association, or corporation in a single state from 20,480 acres to 51,200 acres. Requires that the Secretary of the Interior insure that lessees under such Act who meet specified qualifications be allowed to participate in the planning and granting of rights-of-way for electric power transmission lines in the general area of the lease. Directs the Secretary to insure that such lessees be granted maximum access to existing rights-of-way and existing transmission lines. Authorizes the use of phased environmental assessments in accordance with similarly phased geothermal leasehold rights, to be granted upon the request of a majority of the potential bidders in accordance with procedures to be prescribed by the Secretary."
