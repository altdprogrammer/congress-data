    "text": "National Mass Transportation Assistance Act - Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to authorize appropriations for urban transportation programs under such Act through fiscal year 1980. Establishes minimum funding requirements from such appropriations for specified programs under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to approve as a project eligible for grants under such Act: (1) the lease of facilities used in the provision of public mass transportation service; (2) the payment of operating expenses related to commuter rail service; and (3) the payment of funds to any State, local public body, or private corporation for the operation or improvement of paratransit service such as carpooling and transport related to the provision of social services. Prohibits the Secretary from approving operating assistance grants to any urbanized area which has failed to provide the Secretary with assurances that reasonable progress is being made to strengthen State and local funding sources to subsidize public mass transportation. Removes the restriction that grants for management training programs under such Act be available only to students attending institutions offering graduate programs in fields having application to the urban mass transportation industry. Directs the Secretary to require that projects receiving Federal financial assistance under such Act be planned and operated to allow effective utilization of mass transportation services by elderly and handicapped persons. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and loans to States, local public bodies, and private nonprofit corporations and associations to assist them in providing mass transportation services to meet the special needs of elderly and handicapped persons. Directs that local advisory committees be established immediately to draw up timetables to carry out the provisions of this Act requiring access to mass transportation systems by the elderly and handicapped. Requires that at least half the members of such a committee be elderly or handicapped persons. Authorizes the Secretary to study the transportation component of those Federal programs and projects providing social services and directs the Secretary to submit such study to Congress by October 1, 1978, including a plan to centralize or modify the transportation components of such programs to make the delivery of transportation services more efficient. Directs the Secretary to convert specified equipment and facilities loans made under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 or the Housing Amendments of 1955 into grants under specified conditions."
