    "text": "Declares the finding of Congress that marine fires are a major hazard to port populations and property and have resulted in substantial economic harm. Amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the United States such number of marine firefighting regions as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Stipulates measures for the selection and establishment of regional and satellite firefighting units from each region. Requires each unit, upon order by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to provide firefighting services at any marine fire in any region, and provide education and training in marine firefighting techniques to local fire departments and the crews of merchant vessels. Directs the Secretary to establish marine fire protection and firefighting training programs for members of regional and satellite units and for United States marine seamen. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with concerned States and local governmental agencies setting forth the responsibilities and functions which each party agrees to undertake in carrying out the purposes of this Act. Requires that all seagoing vessels operating in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States have on board a prefire plan for the vessel. Requires that such prefire plan be prepared by, or under the supervision of, a regional or satellite unit, or approved by the Secretary if prepared by an entity other than a regional or satellite unit. Authorizes appropriations of up to $500,000 as a contingency fund to meet the expenses incurred by regional units, satellite units, and other assisting firefighting organizations which have not been reimbursed by vessels owners or operators receiving their services. Authorizes the appropriation of sums necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
