Limits the credits taken by an individual for each dwelling by specific amounts for different types of expenditures. Imposes an additional excise tax on automobiles to penalize vehicles with poorer fuel efficiency. Establishes an initial tax scale for the 1979 model year, ranging from $553 on automobiles with less than 13 miles per gallon (mpg) fuel economy to no tax on automobiles with 15 mpg or better. Increases this tax over six years to a final scale for 1985 and later model years ranging from $3,856 on cars with less than 12.5 mpg fuel economy, to no tax on cars achieving 23.5 mpg or better. Provides that transfers received under this \"Gas Guzzler Tax\" are to be paid into a new Treasury trust fund (the Public Debt Retirement Trust Fund) and applied towards the retirement of the public debt. Postpones the scheduled rate reductions for the excise taxes on gasoline and other motor fuels from 1979 to 1985. Increases the motorboat fuel tax by two cents a gallon. Provides that such taxes will no longer be paid into the Land and Water Trust Fund after 1978, replacing the former 1980 cutoff date. Repeals the excise tax on motor bus bodies and chassis. Refunds excise taxes paid by producers, manufacturers, and importers on buses sold to intermediate dealers, but not yet sold to the ultimate purchaser, where corresponding refunds are made to the dealers and on buses sold to ultimate purchasers after April 20, 1977 and before the first date after this enactment. Repeals the excise tax on bus parts and accessories. Repeals the excise tax on tires, tubes and tread rubber used on buses used predominantly in transporting students and school employees, or on scheduled, common carrier, local, or intercity routes. Refunds the excise taxes paid on gasoline, other motor fuels, and lubricating oil used in such buses. Allows individuals an income tax credit for the first $300 in expenses incurred for the acquisition of any new electric motor vehicle, designed for non-rail transportation on public streets, after April 20, 1977 and before 1983. Imposes a crude oil equalization tax on domestically produced crude oil and liquid natural gas on the initial vendor for an amount gradually equalling the cost of imported oil. Terminates this tax September 30, 1981. Allows the President, subject to the disapproval of either House of Congress, to suspend increases in such tax for up to one year where the President determines it would have a serious effect on the United States economy when combined with new price increases for imported oil. Refunds up to 50 percent of the taxes paid by first sellers of crude oil for investments in new energy production. Directs the Secretary of Energy to report to Congress within 90 days of this enactment on the competitive viability of small and independent refiners, the effects of this tax on them, and remedial legislation the Secretary deems appropriate. Excludes refunds and taxes received from the initial purchaser from the vendor's gross income for income tax purposes. Rebates receipts on this tax attributable to domestically refined distillate fuel oil, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, to retailers where they have sold and delivered the oil into the tank of a school, hospital, church or residential structure, and reduces the purchaser's price by an equivalent amount. Provides an increase in the earned income credit and a rate decrease in the lower individual income tax brackets for tax years beginning in 1978. Provides for the payment of crude oil tax payments into a Crude Oil Equalization Taxes Trust Fund to be managed by the Secretary of the Treasury and to be disbursed or invested in United States obligations, and to States for the development of mass transit systems. Establishes an excise tax on the business use of oil and gas. Provides different tax rates for uses of oil (including all petroleum and petroleum fuel products except natural gas and gasoline) according to three \"tiers\" of usage, the highest tier tax rate being provided electric energy producers with the lowest rate applied against uses in internal combustion engines. Exempts a large number of uses from the tax (generally applying to residential, transportation, petrochemical, retail, and non-manufacturing activities, as well as uses where substitute fuels are not feasible or are precluded by Federal or State pollution regulations). Allows each taxpayer an exempt amount of 50,000 barrels of oil (or its BTU equivalent) for application in taxable business uses. Provides for the reclassification of uses by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the appropriate Federal agencies, where a lower tax classification is consistent with the policy to encourage conversion from, or conservation of, oil and gas, or where a specific facility is otherwise granted an exemption under this Act on its use of petroleum fuels. Applies different tax rates for two tiers of natural gas usages, (internal combustion and utility uses) the rates for non-utility/energy producers uses gradually filling the \"price gap\" in the user's geographic area between natural gas and more expensive petroleum, but not exceeding the price for BTU equivalent residual fuel oil. Provides a ten percent reduction in the taxes due on natural gas acquired under interruptible contracts. Defines the tiers of natural gas uses and exempt uses of natural gas in the same manner as for business uses of oil, lumping natural gas and oil together for purposes of computing the user's exempt amount. Allows the President to suspend this tax, subject to the disapproval of either House of Congress, for up to one year. Allows taxpayers to elect a nonrefundable credit against the tax on business use of oil and gas for new depreciable property, acquired before 1991, which uses alternative fuels, or is used for transporting or producing alternative fuels, or is supplementary pollution control property otherwise required by law. Allows a carryover of the tax credit to the extent it exceeds current liability. Allows a carryover to 1981 of tax liability for 1978 and 1980. Requires that the election for such credit be made before or on the taxpayer's filing deadline for the first taxable year ending after 1978, or 1982 in the case of a regulated public utility. Prescribes special administrative provisions and definitions for property eligible for this credit. Allows a taxpayer to elect a regular investment tax credit for this property to the extent that it qualifies for the same, and to the extent that the taxpayer's current liability for the business use tax (minus carryovers) is exceeded by the allowable business use tax credit. Provides an additional business investment tax credit of ten percent for the period April 20, 1977 through 1982 for property which is not qualified for the regular investment credit but which is alternative energy equipment, recycling equipment, or is otherwise qualified under the definitions of this Act, or under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to cover energy efficient property. Denies the investment tax credit for air conditioning and heating units, and boilers and combustors fueled by petroleum or petroleum products (including natural gas) where coal is not prohibited by Federal or State pollution regulations. Limits the depreciation deduction of petroleum, petroleum product, or natural gas fueled boilers placed in service after June 30, 1977, to the straight line method. Allows the straight line depreciation deduction for boilers in use before April 21, 1977, to be taken against a line \"drawn\" to any early retirement dates established by the taxpayer for the boilers to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury. Makes the Tax Reduction and Simplification Act's temporary reduction in the minimum tax preference for intangible drilling costs a permanent reduction. Allows the deduction of intangible drilling expenses for geothermal wells to the same extent and manner as drilling expenses for gas and oil wells. Allows a ten percent depletion deduction for geothermal deposits, provided that it does not exceed the property's adjusted basis. Extends the excise tax exemption for lubricating oil to cover oils used in producing rerefined lubricating oil. Directs the President to make annual reports to Congress on the tax, energy and other relevant effects of this Title's provisions. Establishes congressional procedures for disapproval, by either House, of Presidential suspensions of the energy excise taxes. Provides administrative provisions for the collection, determination and disbursement of the taxes, rebates, credits, and deductions established under this Title."
