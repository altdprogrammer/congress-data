Eliminates the present requirement that at least 30 days expire before orders relating to surface carriers of the Commission may become effective. Changes the name of the Office of Rail Public Counsel to the Office of Public Counsel. Revises the duties and authority of such office to include proceedings before the Commission involving all surface common carriers subject to regulation by the Commission."
