    "text": "Nonimmigrant Visa Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to jointly prescribe regulations allowing nationals of designated foreign countries to enter the United States as temporary visitors for business or pleasure for 90 days or less. Prohibits nonimmigrants from having their status adjusted and adds a minimum period of two years to any priority date established for consideration for an immigrant visa for any individual admitted as a nonimmigrant under this Act, and who willfully remained beyond the period of authorized stay or has failed to maintain the status in which he was admitted. Directs the Attorney General to prescribe procedures for the removal of aliens who have entered the United States as nonimmigrants without a valid nonimmigrant visa. Authorizes either the Secretary of State or the Attorney General to waive the requirements of registration, fingerprinting, and furnishing of a photograph in the case of any nonimmigrant alien."
