Allows the Secretary to waive the 20 percent coinsurance amount with respect to purchases of durable medical equipment whenever the purchase price of the equipment is at least 25 percent less than the reasonable charge for comparable new equipment. Directs the Secretary to encourage suppliers of durable medical equipment to make their equipment available to individuals entitled to benefits under title XVIII."
