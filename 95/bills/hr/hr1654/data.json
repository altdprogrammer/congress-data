Increases the fine to $1,000 (previously $500) for taking any migratory bird with the intent to sell, offer for sale, barter, or offer to barter such bird. Requires that any person who violates specified provisions of this Act during any period of time in which the Secretary has suspended the migratory game bird hunting season pursuant to this Act, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, and be prohibited from taking any migratory game bird for such a period of time as set by the court, but not to exceed five years."
