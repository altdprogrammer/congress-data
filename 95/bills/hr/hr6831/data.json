Prescribes energy conservation measures to be included in such plans. Establishes criteria governing programs to be carried out by public utilities as part of such energy conservation plans. Authorizes exemptions from such requirements where alternative programs will be implemented. Authorizes the Administrator to implement and enforce a Federal plan in the event of inadequate State action. Declares that nothing in this Act shall supersede any State or local law or regulation, except upon a determination by the Administrator.

Declares that the maximum lawful price for any first sale of new natural gas produced in the United States and delivered during any calendar month which begins on or after the date of the enactment of this Act shall be the current Btu related price at the time of such deliveries. Defines the current Btu related price to be the average per barrel domestic refiner cost of acquiring domestic crude oil in the preceeding three calendar months divided by a Btu conversion factor of 5,800,000 Btu's per barrel of crude oil. Establishes the maximum lawful price for any first sale of old natural gas produced in the United States and sold under an existing contract. Establishes the maximum lawful price for any first sale of old natural gas under a new contract at $1.45 per million Btu's multiplied by the inflation adjustment.

Establishes minimum rate standards for electric utility rates subject to this Act. Requires each State regulated electric utility to gather such information as the Commission determines necessary to determine the cost of providing electric service.

Stipulates that each State regulated utility may recover from its electric consumers the reasonable costs incurred by such utility for any pollution control facility. Prohibits the increase in rates by any State regulated electric utility unless: (1) there has been an opportunity for the consideration of such rate increase in an evidentiary hearing; (2) such rate increase is established to provide incentives for efficient resource use and is necessary to enable the utility to meet its immediate short-term financial obligations; or (3) such increase reflects an increase in the cost of electric power purchased from a centrally dispatched power pool. Requires that the rates of any electric utility which is a State utility agency shall be based on the total of all costs of electric energy generated or purchased for resale by that utility.

Requires the Administrator to develop proposals to improve gas utility rate design and to encourage conservation of natural gas. Stipulates that such proposals be transmitted to each House of Congress within one year of the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits gas utilities from recovering through their rates, the expense of any promotional, political, or institutional advertising. Sets forth the minimum procedural standards which State regulatory authorities must establish regarding the circumstances under which natural gas service may be terminated to any consumer.

Authorizes the President, when he determines that a national energy supply interruption or shortage exists, under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, to allocate coal or prohibit an electric powerplant or MFBI from using natural gas or petroleum. Prohibits Federal facilities constructed by or on behalf of the United States after the effective date of this Act from using natural gas as a primary energy source unless the President informs the Congress that such use is necessary for national security reasons. Requires the Administrator to submit to Congress an annual report describing the actions taken under the coal conversion program. Authorizes the appropriation of $11,500,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 for coal conversion.

Requires all new Federal buildings to be life cycle cost effective in accordance with the methods established under this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish energy performance targets for existing buildings, structures, and facilities. Directs each Federal agency to conduct a preliminary energy audit of all existing Federal buildings under its jurisdiction which contain 30,000 or more square feet. Requires a subsequent energy audit of all Federal buildings which contain at least 1,000 square feet. Requires at least one percent of such square footage in all Federal buildings to be retrofitted to improve their energy efficiency. Requires all existing Federal buildings by January 1, 1990, to have been retrofitted to assure their maximum possible life cycle cost effectiveness. Directs all Federal agencies in leasing buildings to give preference to buildings which use solar heating and cooling or which otherwise have a higher degree of energy efficiency. Directs the Administrator to submit an annual report to Congress on such activities.
