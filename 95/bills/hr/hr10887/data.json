Authorizes annual increases in the initial charge schedule over a ten-year period. Stipulates that such charges shall be levied at the earliest practical stage of the manufacturing sequence. Exempts exported products from the charge schedules established pursuant to this Act. Establishes an Environmental Quality Assistance Fund from all sums received as charges under this title. Authorizes appropriations from the fund for municipal solid waste management plans, in accordance with guidelines established by the Administrator consistent with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Imposes criminal penalties of up to a $10,000 fine and/or five years imprisonment for evasion of the charges imposed by this Act, or for knowing failure to collect charges imposed by this Act. Imposes additional penalties for failure to supply accurate information and for assisting in the furnishing of false information. Title II: General Provisions - Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall preclude States and localities from adopting more stringent solid waste standards. Imposes certain record-keeping requirements upon manufacturers of products covered by this Act. Establishes procedures for judicial review under this Act."
