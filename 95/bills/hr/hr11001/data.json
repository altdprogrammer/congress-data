    "text": "Presidential Records Act - Requires the President to assure that the performance of official Presidential duties is adequately recorded. Permits the President to destroy such records if the President determines, after consultation with the Archivist, that they are of insufficient administrative, historical, or informational value to warrant their continued preservation. Requires the Archivist of the United States to take possession of such records upon completion of the President's term of office and makes the Archivist responsible for their continued preservation. Authorizes the President, before the end of the President's term of office, to place such restrictions as considered necessary or appropriate on access to and use of such records, provided such restrictions remain in effect for not more than 15 years. Requires the Archivist to review such restrictions upon the death of a former President during such period of restriction to determine whether the continuation of any such restriction is warranted. Authorizes the Archivist to place additional restrictions on the access to such records to protect national security or foreign policy and to prevent an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of any individual. Makes such records subject to subpena or other lawful process. Requires the Archivist to promulgate regulations to implement this Act. Makes such regulations subject to veto by either House of Congress."
