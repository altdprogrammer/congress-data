    "text": "Refugee Act - Permits the Attorney General, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, to admit up to 20,000 refugees to the United States. Provides that not more than 5,000 of such admissions may be available to adjust to permanent residence status. Authorizes the President to admit refugees to the United States upon appeal from an international refugee migration organization of which the United States is a member and upon such organization's determination that an emergency refugee situation exists if the President determines that other countries will accept their fair share of refugees. Limits the number of such entering refugees to 15 percent of the total refugee caseload or 5,000, which ever is less. Authorizes the President to admit up to 20,000 such refugees whether or not recommended by such an organization after consultation with the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives after he has determined that an emergency refugee situation exists and that admission of such refugees will significantly promote the national interest and is justified by grave humanitarian concerns. Requires the President to discontinue such admission if it is disapproved by resolution by either House of Congress. Requires the President to report to Congress any exercise of powers under this Act. Permits any alien admitted to the United States under this Act to be admitted as a permanent resident if approved by the Immigration and Naturalization Service two years after such alien has entered the United States. States that permanent resident status will be granted to such alien notwithstanding immigration quotas. Excludes from admission into the United States aliens who have engaged in the persecution of individuals on account of the individuals' race, religion, nationality, affiliations, or political opinions. Restricts the Attorney General's parole authority with respect to refugees. Makes conforming amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act."
