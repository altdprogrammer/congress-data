    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans through the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund to agricultural producers in the United States who sustain losses incurred on or after January 1, 1973, as a direct result of their food crops, animal feedcrops, livestock (including poultry), or livestock products being quarantined or condemned by a Federal or State official because such crops, livestock or products contain quantities of toxic chemicals dangerous to the public health. Sets a maximum loan amount of $100,000, a term of seven years, and leaves the interest rate to the Secretary's discretion. Requires repayment of the loan up to the amount of the compensation within three months of the receipt of any compensation for losses for which the loan was made. Permits the Secretary to postpone all but a nominal amount of principal and interest payments for up to three years."
