Terminates the Federal Energy Administration, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Federal Maritime Commission on October 1, 1981.

Provides for the entrance on lists for appointment in the competitive civil service of personnel employed by any agency terminated by this Act. Gives the Attorney General responsibility for hearings or other actions of terminated agencies which are pending at the time of termination.
