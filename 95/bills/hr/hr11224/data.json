    "text": "Equal Access to Courts Act - Entitles a party which: (1) prevails in any civil action, including an action for judicial review of agency actions; and (2) is a small business as defined by the Small Business Act or an individual or entity having assets or income below specified amounts to a judgment for costs and an award for attorney fees, witness fees, and necessary studies and reports. Directs an agency to pay costs and fees to a party meeting the criteria of (2) above if such a party: (1) successfully defends the imposition of an agency sanction; (2) successfully opposes the issuance or amendments of certain agency orders; or (3) successfully appeals agency action or is subject to agency action which is appealed or reviewed. Entitles a party partially prevailing against the United States to costs and fees to the extent to which it prevailed. Authorizes, where in the interest of justice, an award of cost and fees to a party which fails to prevail in a civil action instituted by or against the United States."
