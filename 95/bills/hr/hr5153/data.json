Sets a maximum loan amount of $100,000, a term of seven years, and leaves the interest rate to the Secretary's discretion. Requires repayment of the loan up to the amount of the compensation within three months of the receipt of any compensation for losses for which the loan was made. Permits the Secretary to postpone all but a nominal amount of principal and interest payments for up to three years."
