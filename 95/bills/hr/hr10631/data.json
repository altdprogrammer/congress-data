    "text": "Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act Amendments - Revises the definition of \"farm labor contractor\" under the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act to, among other changes, (1) exclude bona fide nonprofit agricultural cooperatives and (2) modify the exclusion of regular employees. Requires that validity policies of applicants for registration certificates who have filed proof of workmen's compensation insurance coverage conform with the exclusive remedy provisions of State workmen's compensation law. Amends specified farm labor contractor recordkeeping and reporting requirements making renewal of certification contingent upon submission to the Secretary of Labor of certain information previously provided to and required to be kept by persons furnished with farm laborers."
