Directs the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe regulations with respect to such gambling devices. Makes it unlawful for any master or crew member of such a vessel to use or permit passengers to use such devices when the ship is within the territorial jurisdiction of any State or possession of the United States which prohibits the use of gambling devices."
