    "text": "Conservation and Solar Energy-Federal Building Act - Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration and the Secretary of Defense to develop guidelines to assure utilization of the most effective and efficient energy conservation in the design and construction of Federal buildings and Federally-assisted buildings in the procurement of goods and services for such buildings and for other Federal purposes. Requires that such guidelines be developed in accordance with studies by the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Federal Energy Administration. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary to submit an energy use analysis to the Congress for all new and existing buildings subject to the guidelines developed pursuant to this Act. Lists factors to be evaluated in such energy use analyses. Authorizes increased cost limitations on Federal assistance for building construction and renovation where such building will be furnished with solar or other energy- conserving equipment. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary to define types of energy equipment which will qualify a building for increased Federal assistance."
