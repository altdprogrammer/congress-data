    "text": "Labor Reform Act - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to stipulate that a member of the National Labor Relations Board shall serve beyond the expiration of his term until a successor has been appointed and qualified. Empowers the Board to delegate to its administrative law judges its authority to determine cases alleging unfair labor practices. Directs the Board, after 45 days following the filing of a petition by a group of employees or their representative alleging that: (1) their employer refuses to recognize their chosen bargaining representative; or (2) the representative currently certified or recognized is no longer a representative, or by an employer alleging that more than one individual or labor organization have presented claims to be recognized, to order an election by secret ballot in the unit then sought by the petitioner even though certain issues remain unresolved. Directs the Board to either certify the results of such an election or order a new one upon subsequent determination of such questions. Requires the Board to recognize a labor organization as the exclusive representative of all employees in a collective bargaining unit if such organization: (1) files a petition alleging that 55 percent of the employees within a unit claimed to be appropriate for bargaining purposes are organization members and desire to authorize such organization to exclusively represent all employees within such unit; and (2) makes an appropriate showing thereof. Requires the Board to issue and cause to be served a complaint whenever it is alleged that any person has engaged or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, unless an investigation by the Board discloses that no genuine issue of any material fact exists and that the charged involved fails to state such an unfair practice. Directs the Board to furnish a person making a charge of an unfair labor practice, which does not result in the issuance of a complaint, a written statement of the reasons for not doing so. Empowers the Board to award damages to employees and employers for loss of economic benefits or business opportunities resulting from an employer's refusal to bargain collectively with its employees or from a labor organization's causing or attempting to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of union membership. Authorizes persons suffering financial injury as a result of such practices to bring an action in a United States district court regardless of the amount in controversy, and directs courts in such actions to award treble damages and attorney fees. Requires petitions to review final Board orders with respect to unfair labor practices to be filed in an appropriate United States court of appeals within 30 days of the issuance of such orders. Directs the Board to file its order with an appropriate court of appeals if no petition for review is made. Revises procedures for enforcing orders so filed. Authorizes the Board to delegate to a regional director the power to petition a United States district court for injunctive relief in cases involving unfair labor practices. Enumerates factors to be considered by the Board in seeking injunctive relief. Sets forth procedures whereby persons found to have engaged in flagrant and willful unfair labor practices or a pattern or practice of unfair labor practices designed to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of specified rights relative to organizing and collective bargaining are to be denied Federal contracts for three years."
