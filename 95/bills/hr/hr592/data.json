    "text": "Geothermal Energy Control Act - Establishes the National Geothermal Energy Commission. Directs the Commission to determine, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, all areas of the United States not included under the leasing authority of the Geothermal Steam Act whose prospects for the extraction of geothermal steam or associated geothermal resources warrant expenditures for such purpose. Stipulates that such lands shall be divided into parcels for licensing purposes and that a person may only develop such parcel if granted a license to do so. Stipulates that such licenses shall be valid for 99 years, with extensions at the option of the licensee for as long as such steam or resource is developed. Authorizes persons holding licenses under this Act to acquire licenses to market provided that the geothermal steam or resource is marketed in the same energy form as such steam or resource was extracted from such parcel, or that the resource be marketed as water. Stipulates that holders of licenses under this Act who convert geothermal resources covered by such licenses to electricity may sell such electrical or other forms of energy only to existing utility companies or persons licensed to transmit electricity or other forms of energy."
