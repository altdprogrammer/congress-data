    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1753) Education Amendments - =Title I: Amendment to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965= - States that it is the policy of the United States to assist local educational agencies in meeting the special educational needs of educationally deprived children in low-income areas. Declares that it is also the policy to provide financial assistance in order to meet the special needs of children of certain migrant parents, of Indian children, and of handicapped and neglected or delinquent children. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Office of Education to make payments to State educational agencies until September 30, 1983. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums, in addition to authorizations for local educational agencies, as will assure at least the same level of funding under this Title as in fiscal year 1976 for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Sets forth formula for determining the amount a State is eligible to receive based on the average per pupil expenditure in the United States. States that the grant for which Puerto Rico will be eligible to receive under this section is to be adjusted according to the percentage of the average per pupil expenditure in Puerto Rico plus 32 percent of the expenditure in the 50 States. Permits the Commissioner to grant authority for one year periods to States to make direct allocations to school districts provided the exact same formula factors are used. Provides for the distribution of excess appropriations for fiscal year 1979 according to the 1975 survey of income and education. Directs the Commissioner to utilize specified criteria in determining the number of children aged five through seventeen to be counted. Grants States one Federal dollar for each two dollars of State funds used for compensatory education programs: (1) which satisfy the criteria for purposes of qualifying for an exemption from the excess costs and comparability provisions and (2) in which 50 percent of such State funds are used in areas having high concentrations of children from low-income families. Provides that local educational agencies in a county would be eligible to receive additional grants if the number of children from low-income families aged five to seventeen residing within the county exceeds 5,000 or 20 percent of the total number of countable children in such county. Applies such additional grants exclusively to the 50 States and Puerto Rico. Authorizes school districts to: (1) use enrollment data in certain schools in lieu of area residency; (2) continue eligibility for certain schools and areas for a fiscal year even if they no longer satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements; (3) skip higher ranked schools where lower ranked schools have a substantially higher incidence of educational deprivation than the higher ranked schools; and (4) skip higher ranked schools receiving services of the same nature and scope from non-Federal sources as would otherwise have been provided under Title I. Authorizes school districts to: (1) continue eligibility for children who are no longer in greatest need of assistance but who are still educationally deprived; (2) continue eligibility for the remainder of the year for children who have been transferred in mid-year to ineligible areas; and (3) skip greatest-need children receiving services of the same nature and scope from non-Federal sources as they would otherwise have received under Title I. Sets forth the requirements for design and implementation which must be met by a local educational agency before such agency may receive funds under this Title. Stipulates that such funds shall be allocated among project areas or schools on the basis of the number and needs of children. Requires the Commissioner of Education to consult with State and local educational agencies before developing standards and a schedule for conducting evaluations of compensatory education programs. Requires with respect to Title I programs: (1) that teachers and administrators be informed of significant information derived from educational research, demonstration, and similar projects; (2) that teachers and school boards be included in the planning of such programs; (3) that parents of participating children be informed on the instructional goals of such programs; (4) that local educational agencies consider including components designed to sustain achievement gains beyond the school year; and (5) that programs for the training of education aides be coordinated to include the participation of the professional staff. Requires local educational agencies, in order to receive funds under this Act, to establish advisory councils composed of members elected by the parents, the majority being parents of children to be served by the projects and which include representatives of the children. Establishes advisory councils which must: (1) be composed of not less than eight members; (2) meet a sufficient number of times per year at locations chosen by the council; and (3) have elected officers. Makes teachers at a project school eligible for selection to a parent council regardless of the school district in which such teacher resides. Sets forth the responsibilities of such advisory council including the provison of access to pertinent regulations and guidelines and to appropriate documents. Stipulates that applications must describe the program of training for council members. Authorizes funds for parent workshops and model training programs. Permits the Commissioner to waive for one year the provision of free public education where exceptional and unforeseen circumstances exist and reduces a school district's allocation in proportion to the amount expended by such local educational agency which was less than the amount expended for the second preceding fiscal year. Allows local educational agencies to use funds received under this Title only for the excess costs of programs and projects for educationally deprived children. Defines \"excess costs\" for purposes of this provision. Requires that educationally deprived children, in the aggregate, residing in areas and schools eligible for assistance under Title I, receive at least the same level of such special State and local funds that would have been made available to such children in the absence of funds under Title I. Requires that certain school districts demonstrate comparability where all schools are designated project area schools. Allows the Commissioner to waive such requirement in certain situations. States that Federal funds do not have to be accounted for separately by local educational agencies where the State or local programs are identical to Title I programs and such funds are excluded in determining comparability. Sets forth minimum standards respecting the establishment of complaint resolution procedures including, but not limited to, provisions for specific time limits for investigation and resolution of complaints. Encourages the development of individualized plans agreed upon jointly by the agency, the teacher, the parent or guardian, and, when appropriate, the child. Requires a local educational agency to provide special educational services and arrangements for educationally deprived children enrolled in private schools. States the expenditures for educational services and arrangements for such children shall be equal (taking into account the number of children to be served and the special educational needs of such children) to expenditures for children enrolled in the public schools of the local educational agency. Requires the Commission to arrange for services for such children enrolled in private schools upon the determination that the local educational agency has failed substantially in providing special programs on an equitable basis. Directs the Commisssioner to withhold the amount of providing such services from the State or local educational agency's allocation and to pay the cost of such services to the arranged provider. Permits State or local education agencies, dissatisfied with the Commissioner's final action, to file within a specified period of time with the United States Court of Appeals a petition for review of such action. Allows a local educational agency to exclude State and local funds expended for carrying out special or State phase-in programs for the purpose of determining compliance with the requirement (a) permitting funds to be used only for excess costs of programs and projects and (b) relating to comparability of services. Lists criteria for determining the compliance of programs with such requirements. Requires both the Commissioner and the State education agency to make advance determininations of whether a program meets the requirements to be assisted under this provision. Permits local educational agencies qualifying the exclusion from excess cost and comparability provisions and receiving the funds for which it is eligible to utilize additional State and local funds for special programs and projects which are solely for educationally deprived children residing in non-project areas or attending nonproject schools, including areas and schools ineligible for assistance. Permits schools having 75 percent or higher concentrations of children from low-income families to utilize Title I funds to design a single Title I program for all children in the school, provided that the school district satisfies certain conditions. Sets forth requirements for the expenditure of Title I funds for such school-wide projects including, but not limited to, that the average per pupil expenditure in the school involved in such a project be no less than the expenditure in such school in the previous fiscal year. Allows personnel paid entirely by funds under this Act to be assigned to certain limited, rotating, supervisory duties not related to classroom instruction, the benefits of which are not limited to participating children under this Act. Prescribes requirements applicants must satisfy in order to receive Title I funds for programs for migratory children, handicapped children, and neglected and delinquent children. Adds the Northern Mariana Islands to the list of insular territories receiving allotments for grants from authorized appropriations.

Requires the Commissioner to adopt procedures to assure timely resolution of audits.

Permits the Commissioner upon the finding that there has been a failure to comply with assurances in an approved application to: (1) withhold only that portion of funding that related to a noncompliance; (2) enter into a compliance agreement and resume payments where the agency has demonstrated that immediate compliance is not feasible; or (3) stop payments to the State. Requires the Commissioner to publish a policy mannual on Title I no later than six months after the publication of final regulations required by this Act. Specifies that such manual shall be distributed to State, State educational and local educational agencies, and district-wide parent advisory councils to assist in the preparation of applications and the development and evaluation of programs, and to ensure uniform interpretation and enforcement of requirements. Requires the Commissioner to submit to the Congress in 1980, 1982, and 1984, a report concerning enforcement of this Title. Authorizes the Commissioner to pay each State the amount which it and the local educational agencies of that State are eligible to receive under this Title. Allows States to use up to 1.5 percent of the amount allocated to the State for State administration and specifies a minimum amount of $225,000 per State and $50,000 for insular territories for this purpose.
