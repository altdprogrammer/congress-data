    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to increase from three to five years the issuance and renewal periods for which broadcast station licenses shall be granted. Stipulates that, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Act, the Federal Communications Commission, in acting upon an application for the renewal of a license, may not consider the application of any other person for the facilities for which such renewal is sought. States that if the Commission finds the public interest will be served then the renewal application shall be granted."
