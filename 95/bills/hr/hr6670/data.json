    "text": "National Climate Program Act - Requires the President to establish a National Climate Program to: (1) obtain, analyze, and disseminate climate data; (2) perform research to improve understanding of climate and the causes of fluctuations and anomalies in climate, and develop models for predicting climate changes; (3) develop methods to detect and predict such changes, to give early alerts of incipient anomalies, and to evaluate prediction techniques; (4) support and conduct assessments to the impact on human activities of climate changes; and (5) disseminate information on climate predictions. Authorizes the Program to make grants to educational institutions for the establishment of climate study centers, and for regional studies programs. Requires the President to designate a Federal agency, referred to as the \"lead agency,\" within which the Program will be administered. Requires the head of the lead agency to establish a National Climate Program Office to administer the Program. Stipulates that the President shall ensure that representatives of Federal agencies, conducting activities relating to the Program, are designated to serve on a Management Council for the Program which shall advise the lead agency, the Office, the State Department, and the President on specified matters relating to climate, and participate in developing the Program's budget. Requires the head of the lead agency, in consultation with the Management Council, to appoint an Advisory Council consisting of representatives of diverse interests relating to the Program to perform certain advisory and reporting functions. Requires the Office to publish a preliminary five-year plan including goals, priorities funding requirements, and the involvement of Federal agencies. Sets forth procedures for budget development. Requires the Office to submit to specified Congressional committees an annual report on the activities of the Program.
