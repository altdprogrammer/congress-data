    "text": "National Materials Technology Research and Policy Planning Act - Title I: National Materials Policy - Declares it the finding of Congress that materials production, distribution, and consumption, as well as the disposal of wastes and by-products thereof have a pervasive effect upon the economic, social, and political constitution of the Nation, and upon the natural environment. Declares that the Nation needs a materials policy which will encourage the most efficient use of materials and where possible, the reuse or recycling of all materials. Declares that the Nation must develop a materials policy which, in concert with the community of nations, will coordinate the production, distribution, and use of materials consistent with changing human needs and the production of the natural environment. Title II: National Materials Policy Plan - Requires the President to prepare and submit to Congress, at specified times, a national materials plan. Requires that such plan establish objectives for materials production, distribution, and consumption as well as for the disposal of wastes and by-products. Directs that such plan identify strategies and objectives for periods of 50 years, 25 years, and five years after the initial transmission of the plan. Title III: Implementation - Requires the President to report to Congress by July 1, 1979, concerning a schedule for the preparation of a national materials plan. Directs that such report include: (1) a program of materials research and development; (2) legislative recommendations for the establishment of programs and institutions to carry out the purposes of this Act; (3) requests for appropriations; and (4) recommendations concerning the establishment of appropriate international institutions and programs to coordinate materials policies worldwide. Requests that the President, in such report, attempt to anticipate shortages in materials and the environmental, social, and economic effects of materials production, distribution, consumption, and waste disposal."
