    "text": "Stocks Management and Reserve Act -- Title I: Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish, maintain and dispose of a separate reserve of wheat, corn and other enumerated feed grains through storage contracts with producers. Limits such reserves to no less than 25 million tons nor more than 35 million tons. Specifies how the Secretary may establish such reserves through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Title II: Amends the Agriculture Act of 1949 to set the loan level per bushel of wheat at $2.25 for the 1977 crop and $2.35 for the 1978 through 1981 crops. Sets the loan level per bushel of corn at $1.75 for the 1977 crop and $2.00 for the 1978 through 1981 crops. Sets a formula for the adjustment of the respective loan rates under specified circumstances. Requires the Secretary to set a fair and reasonable loan level on each crop of barley, oats, and rye. Title III: Amends the Agriculture Act of 1949 to authorize the President (1) to enter into negotiations with other nations to develop an international system of food reserves to provide for humanitarian food relief needs, and (2) to establish and maintain an International Emergency Food Reserve, as a contribution of the United States toward the development of such a system, to be made available in the event of food emergencies in foreign countries. Requires for such reserve minimum stocks of two million tons, allowing an increase up to six million tons pursuant to an international agreement. Requires periodic rotation of such stocks to avoid spoilage and deterioration."
