Amends such Act to repeal the requirement that the State and other official agencies designated to perform inspection or weighing functions pay fees to the Administrator to cover the costs of the direct supervision of personnel of such agencies by the field office personnel of the Federal Grain Inspection Service. Authorizes appropriations to cover such supervisory costs. Amends such Act relative to recordkeeping. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, within six months of the effective date of this Act, to review certain recordkeeping provisions of Federal law and the regulations of the Commodity Credit Corporation as they apply to grain elevators, warehouses or other grain storage and handling facilities. Directs the Secretary, on the basis of such review, to establish a single system for recordkeeping by such facilities that will meet the requirements of such regulations and the law."
