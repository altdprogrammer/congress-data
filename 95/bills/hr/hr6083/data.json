    "text": "Consumer Protection Act - Sets forth the findings of Congress that the interests of consumers are inadequately represented and protected within the Federal Government. Establishes an Office of Consumer Protection to advise the Congress on matters affecting the interests of consumers, and to protect and promote the interests of the people of the United States as consumers. States that the functions of the Office shall be: (1) to represent the interests of consumers before Federal agencies and courts to the extent authorized by this Act; (2) to encourage research and testing of consumer products and services; (3) to submit recommendations annually to the Congress on measures to improve the operation of the Federal Government in protecting consumer interests; (4) to publish and distribute material which will inform consumers of matters of interest to them; (5) to conduct conferences and surveys concerning the needs, interests, and problems of consumers; and (6) to keep the appropriate committees of Congress fully and currently informed. Requires the Director of the Office of Consumer Protection to investigate consumer complaints with regard to a Federal agency proceeding or activity, and to maintain a file with regard to each complaint investigated. States that the Office shall maintain a public document room containing an up-to-date listing of all signed consumer complaints of any significance for public inspection and copying. Provides that whenever a congressional committee having specific oversight responsibility with respect to the operations of a Federal agency determines that the result of a proceeding or activity of such agency may substantially affect consumer interest, such committee may by resolution order the Director to intervene as a party. Requires the Office to develop, on its own initiative, information, statistics, and other data concerning: (1) the functions and duties of the Office; (2) consumer products and services; (3) problems encountered by consumers generally, including annual reports on interest rates and commercial and trade practices which adversely affect consumers; and (4) notices of Federal hearings and other pertinent activities of Federal agencies that affect consumers. Directs the Office to encourage research and testing which would be useful and beneficial to consumers, and to report to the Congress on the desirability and feasibility of establishing a National Consumer Information Foundation which would administer a voluntary program containing information based on uniform standards relating to the performance, safety, durability, and care of the product. Stipulates that neither a Federal agency nor the Director shall declare one product to be better than any other product. Authorizes the Director to issue written interrogatories or requests for reports to the extent required to protect the health or safety of consumers, or to discover consumer fraud, or substantial economic injury to consumers. Prohibits the Office from disclosing to the public or to any State or local agency any information in a form which would reveal trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential. States that the Director, in releasing information concerning consumer products and services, shall determine that such information is accurate, and no part of such information is prohibited from disclosure by law. Sets forth procedures to protect consumer interests in Federal administrative proceedings. Prohibits sex discrimination in any program or activity receiving Federal assistance under this Act. Authorizes appropriations of sums necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1978."
