    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1300) Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act - =Title I: Purposes, Definitions, and Maps= - Declares it the purpose of this Act to preserve for the benefit, use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations certain lands and waters in the State of Alaska that contain nationally significant natural, scenic, historic, archeological, geological, scientific, wilderness, cultural, recreational, and wildlife values. States the intent of this Act to provide the opportunity for people engaged in a subsistence-oriented lifestyle to continue to do so, consistent with management of fish and wildlife in accordance with recognized scientific principles and the purposes for which each conservation system unit is established, designated, or expanded by or pursuant to this Act. Excludes land selections of the State of Alaska which have been tentatively approved under the Alaska Statehood Act, as well as certain other selections, from the definition of \"public lands\". Requires that the boundary maps described in titles II through VII of this Act be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture with regard to the National Forest System. Directs that (1) a map and legal description of each change in land management status affected by this Act be published in the Federal Register and filed with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, as soon as practicable after enactment of this Act, and (2) such maps and legal descriptions be on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Secretary of the Interior. =Title II: National Park System= - Establishes as units of the National Park System; (1) Aniakchak National Monument and Aniakchak National Preserve; (2) Bering Land Bridge National Preserve; (3) Cape Krusenstern National Preserve; (4) Gates of the Arctic National Park, Gates of the Arctic National Preserve, and Gates of the Arctic National Recreation Area; (5) Kenai Fjords National Park; (6) Kobuk Valley National Monument and Kobuk Valley National Preserve; (7) Lake Clark National Park and Lake Clark National Preserve; (8) Misty Fjords National Preserve; (9) Noatak National Preserve and Noatak National Recreation Area; (10) Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park and Wrangell-Saint Elias National Recreation Area; and (11) Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve.
