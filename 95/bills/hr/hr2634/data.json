    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration to make loans to individuals, families, and builders to assist them in purchasing and installing qualified solar energy equipment. Enumerates the conditions of such loans, prohibiting loan application approval unless the proposed equipment is being purchased from a small business concern and, unless being installed by the applicant, is being installed by a small business concern. Provides an exception where no small business solar energy equipment marketing or installation concern operates within 300 miles of the structure involved. Requires the Energy Research and Development Administration, in carrying out the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974, to establish inspection procedures, review new components, and review outstanding certifications for solar energy equipment. Establishes a solar energy loan fund to finance loans made under this Act."
