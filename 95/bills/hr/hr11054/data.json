Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to prescribe a uniform marine theft reporting system which shall apply to vessels 16 feet or over in length which are stolen afloat. Stipulates that such system shall provide for the reporting of all thefts of such vessels to the Coast Guard. Directs the Coast Guard to: (1) initiate prompt investigations of reported thefts; (2) issue vessel lookouts; (3) make appropriate enteries into law enforcement data and analysis centers of other Federal law enforcement agencies; (4) provide assistance to other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies in the recovery of stolen vessels; and (5) include training in marine theft prevention and investigation in the curriculum of its Boating Safety School for State marine law enforcement officials. Makes it illegal to conceal a vessel's identification number. Prescribes criminal penalties for such willful violations. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1979 through 1981 to provide financial assistance to State boating safety and marine theft prevention programs."
