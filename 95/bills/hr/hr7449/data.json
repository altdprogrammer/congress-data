Prohibits such contracting officer from owning a controlling interest in any contractor who has been affected by action taken by such officer. Prohibits such contracting officer from accepting employment within two years following his employment with the United States from any contractor who was affected by the action of such officer taken by him or her within three years prior to the termination of his or her employment with such agency, and from accepting employment with such a contractor in a position which was created or subsidized by revenues realized through a Federal contract handled by such officer until five years after the termination of such officer's employment with such agency has been terminated. Prohibits contractors from offering to any such officer of any compensation such officer is prohibited from receiving under this Act. Establishes a Conflict of Interest Review Board to review compliance by contracting officers with this Act. States that the Board shall issue advisory opinions with respect to compensation offered to such contracting officer after notice is published in the Federal Register and interested parties have had an opportunity to present testimony relating to the issuance of such advisory opinion. States that reliance on such advisory opinion shall be a defense to a civil or criminal case brought under this Act. Requires meetings of the Board at which such advisory opinions will be considered to be open to the public. Authorizes the Board to issue rules to implement this Act. Requires the Board to report annually to Congress respecting its activities and recommendations of legislative or regulatory actions to promote high ethical standards for Government employees. Requires the following persons to file specified information with the Board: (1) former Government employees who were employed in any given fiscal year as a representative of a Government contractor in any action in which the United States was a party or in any transaction with the United States; and (2) any Federal employee who was previously employed by a Government contractor at a salary rate equal to or greater than that for positions in grade GS-13. Exempts specified persons from the filing requirements of this Act."
