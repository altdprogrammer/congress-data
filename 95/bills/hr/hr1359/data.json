    "text": "Food Stamp Nutrition Reform Act - Defines \"food\" in the Food Stamp Act of 1964 to mean any food or food product of high nutritional value, manufactured or produced for human consumption, and approved for purchase with food stamps. Requires manufacturers or processors desiring to have their products so approved to submit an application to the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary to approve only products of high nutritional value and to send a list of such products to Congress for approval; which approval shall be deemed granted at the end of 60 calendar days if Congress does not adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval. Establishes a procedure for periodic review of products so approved and requires manufacturers or processors to label each product as approved for food stamp purchase, unless the Secretary determines such labeling for a particular product (fresh meat, vegetables or fruit) not to be feasible. Eliminates any requirement that an eligible household purchase a minimum amount of food stamps in order to participate in the food stamp program."
