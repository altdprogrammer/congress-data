Rept. 95-1768) Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act - =Title I: Pension for Veterans and Survivors= - Establishes rates for pensions which may be elected in lieu of regular pensions by: (1) veterans of a period of war who are permanently and totally disabled from a non-service- connected disability; and (2) surviving spouses or children of veterans of a period of war of deceased veterans entitled to compensation or retirement pay for a service-connected disability. Specifies exclusions from the determination of annual income of such veterans and survivors. Provides that any veteran, surviving spouse, or child receiving a pension under this Title or the Veterans' Pension Act of 1959 may elect at any time to receive such pension instead of another such pension. Makes election of benefits irrevocable. Requires persons applying for an improved pension to report the income and estate of each spouse and child on account of whom such added pension is applied for or received. =Title II: Dependency and Indemnity Compensation for Surviving Parents= - Establishes an improved program for parents of veterans receiving dependency and indemnity compensation. Limits eligibility for such improved pension to parents residing within the 50 States or District of Columbia. Allows parents who reside outside of the 50 States and the District of Columbia and who become eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation, after the effective date of the improved program, to apply for and receive benefits available under existing law. Sets forth exclusions in determining annual income of surviving parents applying for or receiving benefits under such improved program. =Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions and Conforming Amendments, Definition of \"Pension\"= Requires annual adjustments of security pension rates in conjunction with cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to carry out a comprehensive study of the income characteristics of veterans of a period of war and their survivors who are residing outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia. =Title IV: Effective Date= - Sets the effective date of this Act as January 1, 1979."
