Terminates the Federal Energy Administration, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Federal Maritime Commission on October 1, 1981. States that such agencies may be continued for an additional period of six years at a time if such extension is authorized by specific legislation after public hearings are held on the appropriateness of such extension and after receipt of reports from the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget fully evaluating each such agency separately. States that any such bill or resolution may not be approved if it seeks to extend or establish more than one such agency. Provides for the entrance on lists for appointments in the competitive civil service of personnel employed by any agency terminated by this Act. Gives the Attorney General responsibility for hearings or other actions of terminated agencies which are pending at the time of termination. States that all contracts to which a terminated agency is a party shall be terminated as for the convenience of the Government. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 3501; 3502; Adds 5 U.S.C. 3505)"
