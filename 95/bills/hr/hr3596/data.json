    "text": "United States Court of Labor- Management Relations - Establishes a United States Court of Labor-Management Relations to have jurisdiction over labor disputes in industries substantially affecting interstate commerce that have resulted, or threaten to result, in a concerted work stoppage which adversely affects or potentially adversely affects the general welfare of the nation. Permits the jurisdiction of the court to be invoked either: (1) upon application of the Attorney General after all procedures for enjoining work stoppages under the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 and the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted; or (2) upon application of any party to the labor dispute regardless of the availability of alternate procedures. Empowers the Court, upon the invocation of its jurisdiction, to enjoin the work stoppage. Authorizes the Court, after enjoining a work stoppage, to require the parties to a dispute to attend hearings with respect to the causes and the circumstances of the dispute and conferences to consider the positions of the parties and any settlement proposals. Directs the Court to set a matter down for immediate hearing and final judicial determination if the parties fail to settle their difference within 80 days of the issuance of the injunction or if the parties agreed to continue to attempt beyond such 80 day period to voluntarily settle their differences and thereafter advise the Court that a negotiated settlement is impossible. Sets forth procedures for such hearings. Limits the power of the Court, in making a final determination of any case with respect to which there is in effect a valid collective bargaining agreement or other similar contract, in applying or interpreting such agreement. Specifies guidelines to be followed by the Court in fixing rates of pay or other conditions of employment. States that the decisions of the Court shall be final unless they are arbitrary and capricious or are violations of a constitutional right, in which case the Supreme Court shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction."
