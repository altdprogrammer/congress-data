Redefines the term \"historic structure\" as any structure registered in the National Register of Historic Places or certified as such by the Secretary of the Interior. Permits increases of up to 30 percent of the amount of a loan allowed under this Act, if such increase in necessary for architectural rehabilitation of historic structures. Title II: Authorization of Matching Assistance for the Preservation of Historic Structures under Certain Housing Laws and the Act of October 15, 1966 - Permits the making of matching grants to States for historic preservation projects regardless of whether such projects receive federally insured or guaranteed loans or direct loans."
