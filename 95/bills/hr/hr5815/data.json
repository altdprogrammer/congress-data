Enumerates the basis upon which a franchisor may terminate or fail to renew a franchise. Exempts trial franchises from the requirements of this Act. Requires that 90 days advance notice of termination or nonrenewal be made in writing and delivered to the franchisee. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to publish in the Federal Register a summary of this Act. Authorizes civil actions in a United States district court against any franchisor who violates any requirement of this Act. Provides for the preemption of State laws unless such law is the same as the applicable provisions of this Act. Title II: Octane Disclosure - Requires the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) establish testing procedures for the determination of the octane rating of automotive gasoline; (2) establish requirements applicable to refiners with respect to the testing of automotive gasoline; (3) establish a certification procedure applicable to the distribution of automotive gasoline; and (4) establish requirements applicable to retailers of gasoline with respect to display of the octane rating of automotive gasoline at the point of sale. Prohibits any person who distributes automotive gasoline from making representations respecting the octane rating of gasoline unless the gasoline has been tested in accordance with the procedures established by the Federal Trade Commission. Grants to the Commission the procedural, investigative, and enforcement powers necessary to make effective the rules required to be prescribed. Makes it an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act to violate the rules prescribed by this Act. Authorizes judicial review of the rules prescribed under this Act."
