Rept. 95-342) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals an income tax credit for 75 percent of the sum of all political contributions to the United States Senate, instead of the 50 percent generally allowed for political contributions. Increases the limitation on credit taken for political contributions to $100 ($200 for joint returns), of which no more than $25 (or $50 for joint returns) may be applied to contributions to candidates for the Senate. Denies the alternative income tax deduction for political contributions for contributions to Senate candidates. Permits the taxpayer to apply the credit as a claim for a refund (with a 60 day repayment period) or as a credit for his tax liability for the preceding taxable year. Allows the taxpayer to take such credit for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976."
