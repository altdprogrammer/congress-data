Sets forth procedures for the execution of such functions. Title IV: Amendments to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act - Requires State plans under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to include provisions for the reporting of forms of family violence in addition to child abuse and neglect.
