    "text": "Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to change the coverage of the Act from those between ages 40 and 65 to include all individuals over 40 years of age. States that nothing in such Act shall be construed to permit any action prohibited by such Act against any individual who is at least 40 years of age because of: (1) the nature of employment of such individual; or (2) any retirement benefits to which such individual may be entitled. Repeals requirements relating to civil service employees which state: (1) that an individual who has reached age 70 may be appointed to a position in the competitive service only on a temporary basis; (2) that an individual who reaches the prescribed retirement age may not continue in the civil service; and (3) that an employee who becomes 70 years of age and completes 15 years of service shall be automatically separated, that an air traffic controller shall be separated from the service at age 56, and that a law enforcement officer or firefighter shall be retired upon completing 20 years of service or attaining age 55. Eliminates mandatory retirement of a specified age for noneducational employees of the University of the District of Columbia. Eliminates mandatory retirement at a specified age for: (1) Foreign Service Reserve officers; (2) career ambassadors and career ministers; (3) participants in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System who are not career ambassadors or career ministers; and (4) foreign service staff officers and employees."
