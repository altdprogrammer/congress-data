    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require that comprehensive State plans which must be submitted for law enforcement assistance thereunder provide for (1) a system for the receipt, investigation, and determination of complaints submitted by law enforcement officers, and (2) the formulation of a law enforcement officers' bill of rights. Requires the discontinuance of such assistance to States, local government, and public agencies which have not established and put into operation such a complaint system or have not enacted such an officers' bill of rights within one year after the enactment of this Act. Lists protections which must be contained in each law enforcement officers' bill of rights including the following: (1) allowing off-duty officers to engage in political activities; (2) granting officers specified procedural rights in connection with investigations of their conduct on duty which may lead to a personnel action; (3) requiring officer representation on any police complaint review board established in the jurisdiction; (4) prohibiting mandatory disclosure of officers' finances; and (5) establishing a law enforcement officers' grievance commission in the jurisdiction to determine officer grievances."
