Requires that any bill or resolution reported by a committee of either House of Congress which confers authority to require such information from persons, States, or local governments be accompanied by a statement describing the information sought and the costs to be incurred in processing such information by such agency or by such respondents. Requires that such report include the costs associated with alternative methods of information gathering. Requires the Bureau of the Census, upon request, to provide Members of Congress with information relating to the evaluation of any existing or proposed Federal statistical authority or information which would be appropriate for the cost estimates required to be included in committee reports under this Act.
