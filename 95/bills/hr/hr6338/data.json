    "text": "Broadcast License Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to set the term of a television broadcast station license, or renewal, at four years and for a radio or other class of station at five years. Requires the Federal Communication Commission, in determining whether public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the renewal of a broadcast license, to grant the renewal if the licensee has been responsive to the public station and its station operation lacked serious deficiencies. Requires each licensee to annually solicit the views of various categories of the audience served by the licensee and to prepare and maintain a report which shall be available for public inspection. Allows the Commission to set a time limitation during which any interested party may file a petition to deny an application. Prescribes the actions which the Commission may take after receiving a petition to deny. Describes the preliminary response to such petition which a contested applicant may file. Allows appeals from decisions and orders of the Commission to be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which such broadcast facility is located."
