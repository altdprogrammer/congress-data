Directs the Bank to seek an agreement with other government agencies to reduce and eliminate government-supported export financing. Requires the Secretary of State to report to the appropriate Congressional committees and to the Bank upon a determination by the Secretary that a country has violated (1) the nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or (2) a safeguard agreement with the United States concerning civil use of nuclear energy, or (3) that a non-nuclear state has detonated a nuclear explosive device. Prohibits the Bank to approve credit to such country unless the President determines that such credit approval is in the national interest and reports this determination to Congress. Prohibits the bank from guaranteeing, insuring, or extending credit in connection with the purchase of any liquid metal fast breeder nuclear reactor or any nuclear fuel reprocessing facility. Extends the authority of the Export-Import Bank to September 30, 1978."
