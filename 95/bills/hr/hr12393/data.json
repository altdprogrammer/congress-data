Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the seizure of any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft which is used to bring illegal aliens into the United States. Excepts vehicles from such seizure if the owner or master is not a consenting party or if such vehicle is in illegal possession of any person other than the owner. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate regulations setting forth procedures for the prompt return to the owner of any such vehicle. Provides that provisions of law relating to seizure of vehicles for violations of customs law shall apply to the unlawful bringing of aliens into the United States. Provides that proceedings under these provisions shall be subject to the Supplemental Rules of Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims."
