Requires the Congressional Budget Office to prepare a statement to accompany each public bill or resolution reported out of a congressional committee estimating the costs such legislation would impose on State or local governments during the five-year life of such law. Prohibits the enactment of such bill or resolution without also authorizing budget authority for payment by the United States to such State and local governments for costs so imposed. Requires the Comptroller General to prepare for all reported legislation a statement identifying State or local programs designed to accomplish the same purposes as such reported legislation and recommending ways to avoid the duplication of such programs. Requires Federal agencies to publish a similar five-year State and local cost statement in the Federal Register for program-implementing regulations promulgated by such agencies. Requires such agencies to submit to Congress an annual review of each such program."
