Retains alienage as a basis of jurisdiction and increases the amount in controversy requirement from $10,000 to $25,000, for such cases. Abolishes the amount in controversy requirement in Federal question cases. Retains statutory interpleader as a basis for Federal jurisdiction. Permits venue for a Federal civil action in any judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or in which a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to require an amount of $10,000 in controversy in order to create Federal jurisdiction. Authorizes the district courts to deny costs to the plaintiff or to impose costs on the plaintiff where the plaintiff is finally adjudged to be entitled to recover less than the sum of value of $10,000."
