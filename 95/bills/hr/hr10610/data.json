    "text": "Surplus School Recycling Act - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants to local agencies to pay the costs of renovating surplus school facilities so they may be converted for other educational and social purposes. Suggests purposes for which conversion grants may be extended, including: (1) community centers; (2) senior citizens centers; (3) day care centers; (4) vocational schools; (5) medical facilities; and (6) recreational centers. Sets forth application requirements which local agencies must complete States that the amount of a grant under this Act shall be 80 percent of the estimated cost of renovation. Requires local agencies which receive a grant for more than the actual cost of renovation to return surplus money to the Secretary. Sets priorities to be followed by the Secretary in approving applications for grants under this Act. Directs the Secretary to serve as a national clearinghouse to local agencies by providing information on feasible alternative uses of surplus school facilities. Requires the Secretary to prepare and submit to the President and Congress: (1) a yearly report listing local agencies receiving grants and the purposes for which such grants were made; and (2) a detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of the program based on cost analysis and a survey of school closure problems to be submitted at the end of three years."
