Provides that the difference between the amount yielded by the tax rates established by this Act and the amount which would have been yielded if the Social Security Amendments of 1977 had gone into effect shall be paid into the social security trust funds from general revenues. Increases Federal contributions to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund established under Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act by 50 percent. Increases the ceiling on the amount of income that is subject to social security taxation to $100,000 in 1980."
