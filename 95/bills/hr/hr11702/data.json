    "text": "Health Maintenance Organization Act Amendments - Amends the term used to describe the providers of basic health services in Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) organized under the Public Health Service Act from \"health professionals\" to \"physicians,\" thereby excluding from the services provided by a HMO the services of dentists, nurses, podiatrists, optometrists, and such other individuals engaged in the delivery of health services as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may designate. Increases the maximum amounts available for: (1) grants and guarantees of loans for initial development of HMO's; (2) loans made or guaranteed for initial operation costs of HMO's. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans and guarantees to nonfederal lenders of payment of principal and interest on loans made to equip, construct, acquire, or renovate ambulatory care facilities. Extends for five years, through fiscal year 1985, the period during which loans and loan guarantees may be made for initial operation costs of HMO's. Establishes in the Treasury a loan and loan guarantee fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities under loans and loan guarantees for the establishment and renovation of ambulatory care facilities. Directs employers who are required to offer membership in a HMO to their employees to arrange, at the option of the employee, for payroll deductions from such employees' salary for membership in a qualified HMO. Extends the authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1984 for feasibility surveys and planning and initial operating costs of HMO's. Requires the Secretary to establish a National Health Maintenance Organization Intern Program for the purpose of training qualified HMO administrators and managerial personnel. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1983 for this purpose. Requires each HMO to annually file with the Secretary specified financial information. Requires the Secretary to annually file a report with Congress based on the information gathered from such financial disclosures."
