Rept. 95-1622) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt trustee services by tax exempt foundations to disqualified persons from the excise tax on self-dealing where: (1) the service is pursuant to an irrevocable trust established before October 9, 1969; (2) the foundation's chartering State forbids it from acting as a trustee where it has no beneficial interest; (3) the foundation receives reasonable compensation for its services; and (4) the disqualified person's status as such arises solely from the trust instrument. Applies such provisions to services furnished from 1980 through 1989."
