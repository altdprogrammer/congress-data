Prohibits the advertisement of such product which is not consistent with tests prescribed by this Act. Requires the Commission to direct the Director of the National Bureau of Standards to develop water consumption tests for covered products. Directs the Commission to prescribe regulations for the conduct of such tests. Permits the Commission to exempt a product from such tests if water consumption comparisons between different models of such product are not feasible. Requires manufacturers of covered products to conduct water consumption tests and to comply with specified reporting and testing requirements. Requires the Commission to direct the Director of the National Bureau of Standards (1) to determine the minimum amount of water required to operate any type of covered product and (2) to publish these findings in the Federal Register. Requires covered products which are imported to comply with labeling and advertising requirements of this Act. Directs the Commission to conduct a public information program with respect to the use of water consumption labeling. Imposes a civil fine for knowing violation of the requirements of this Act. Establishes a civil cause of action against violators of this Act or any Federal agency allegedly failing to carry out its nondiscretionary responsibilities under this Act. Declares a violation of this Act to be an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out this Act. Defines terms used in this Act, including \"covered products\" which means any article which is designed to be dependent on the consumption or flow of water."
