Authorizes the Administrator to waive certain data requirements of the Act pertaining to the efficacy of a pesticide. Authorizes the Administrator to conditionally register or amend the registration of a pesticide substantially similar to any currently registered pesticide. Authorizes the Administrator to conditionally amend the registration of a pesticide to permit additional uses, and to conditionally register a pesticide containing an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide for a period reasonably sufficient for the generation and submission of required data. Permits the classification of pesticides prior to registration. Sets forth the procedure for changing the classification of a registered pesticide from restricted to general use. Requires the Administrator to authorize any State to issue an experimental use permit for a pesticide. Permits the Administrator to consider restricting a pesticide's use as an alternative to cancellation. Sets forth the procedure for cancellation of conditional registrations. Revises the trade secrets provision of the Act to require the applicant to clearly mark and submit separately any data which such applicator considers to be trade secrets or commercial or financial information. Requires such applicant to submit an unmarked summary of each compilation of data marked as trade secrets or commercial or financial information. Sets forth revised disclosure procedures. Includes Indian tribes within the provisions of the Act relating to cooperative agreements with the Administrator for training and enforcement programs. Directs the Administrator to exempt certain pesticides from regulations promulgated under the Act. Requires the Administrator to delegate to the States the primary responsibility for the enforcement of pesticide use violations under the Act."
