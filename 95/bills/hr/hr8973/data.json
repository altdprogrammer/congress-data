    "text": "Motor Carrier Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to direct the Interstate Commerce Commission in the performance of its duties with respect to motor carriers to consider maximum reliance on competitive market forces, the encouragement of new motor carriers, and participation by women and minorities in the motor carrier industry as being in the public convenience and necessity. Sets forth standards which the Commission must apply in determining whether to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity. Stipulates that a party applying for a certificate shall have the burden of showing that it meets the necessary requirements, that a party opposing the issuance shall have the burden of proving that the proposed service is not consistent with the public convenience and necessity, and that a finding that the proposed service is not consistent with the public convenience and necessity must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Stipulates that such standards and requirements regarding proof shall be applicable in the case of applications for permits for contract carriers by motor vehicles. Sets forth procedural time limits during which the Commission must dispose of applications pertaining to common or contract motor carriage. Directs the Commission to review and remove from existing commodity classifications those common and contract carrier operating right restrictions which limit the specific types of commodities that may be carried and the routing necessary to serve authorized points. Stipulates that the Commission may approve a certificate or permit transfer only if it is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that such a transaction will not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. Prohibits the Commission from approving any transaction between two or more motor contract carriers if such transaction would cancel or revoke substantial portions of duplicative operating certificates. Prohibits the Commission from approving a consolidation or merger agreement between two or more carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act unless it is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that such a transaction would not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. Revises the definition of \"interstate commerce\" with respect to motor carriers to exclude the transportation of property if such service has been interrupted after it has arrived in one State from another State and such property is to be transported within that State or to any point not more than 50 miles from the place of arrival. Directs the Secretary of Transportation in consultation with the States to develop recommendations to provide a more efficient and equitable system of State regulations for interstate motor carriers."
