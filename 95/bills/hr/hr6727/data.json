Authorizes the Administrator, in cooperation with the Agency for International Development, to conduct studies on the energy needs, uses, and resources in other countries. Stipulates that such studies should be designed to result in the establishment of an information system permitting transfers of unconventional, nonnuclear energy technologies to impoverished areas of the world. Requires that results of such studies and recommendations for cooperative projects be reported to Congress by July 1, 1978. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000 to the Energy Research and Development Administration for fiscal year 1978 for such purposes."
