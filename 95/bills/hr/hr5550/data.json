    "date": "1977-03-23", 
    "text": "Opportunities for Adoption Act - Makes it the purpose of this Act to facilitate the elimination of obstacles to adoption and facilitate the placement in permanent adoptive homes of children, particularly children with special needs, by: (1) promoting the establishment of uniform adoption regulations in the States and territories of the United States in order to eliminate jurisdictional and legal obstacles to adoption; (2) providing Federal financial assistance to States for the purpose of assisting public and private nonprofit agencies and adoptive and prospective adoptive parents in meeting costs of adoption in order to remove or alleviate the financial obstacles which present serious barriers to adoption by qualified persons; and (3) providing for the establishment of a national office of adoption information and services in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to (A) insure quality standards for adoption services (including preplacement and postplacement and postadoption counseling and standards to protect the rights of children in need of adoption) and (B) provide for a national adoption information exchange system. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to appoint a committee on uniform adoption regulations. Directs such Committee to: (1) review current conditions, practices, and laws relating to adoption, with special reference to their effect on facilitating or impeding the finding of suitable adoptions; (2) propose to the Secretary uniform adoption regulations which would facilitate adoption; and (3) report its proposals to the Congress and the President not later than nine months after the Committee members have been appointed. Requires the Secretary to publish the proposed regulations in the Federal Register within six months following their receipt. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States for allocation, by State agencies principally responsible for services to families and children, to public and private nonprofit adoption agencies which meet standards of quality prescribed pursuant to this Act for the purpose of assisting; (1) such agencies in meeting the cost involved in the adoptive placement of children with special needs (including locating suitable homes and providing preplacement and postplacement and postadoptive counseling to children in need of adoption and to prospective and actual adoptive parents); (2) such agencies in meeting the cost of providing prenatal and postpartum services to mothers, voluntarily planning to place their children for adoption, who are unable to assume such costs, in order to protect the health and welfare of both the mother and child, but only to the extent that assistance under other Federal or State programs in the community in question is not readily available to provide adequately for such services; (3) prospective adoptive parents of children with special needs, who would consider adoption but for their financial inability to meet such child's needs, by sufficiently defraying adoption costs to enable the prospective adoptive parents to adopt such children; and (4) adoptive parents in locating and, where appropriate, defraying the cost of postplacement and postadoption special services to children requiring such services as a result of conditions which existed prior to their placement, up to an amount not exceeding the amount which similar services would cost the State in question were it to provide or secure such services as the guardian of such children. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with State agencies, to ensure (1) annual reviews of the need for and adequacy of assistance; (2) assistance is being provided pursuant to an adoption assistance agreement; and (3) the establishment of a system in each State under which a family providing foster care to a child will be notified of the possibility of financial assistance for adoptive placement under this Act. Directs the Secretary to encourage and facilitate the consideration of comprehensive adoption assistance legislation by those States which have not enacted such legislation. Excludes assistance provided under this Act to adoptive parents or prospective adoptive parents from being taken into account in determining benefits available to such parents under any other Federal programs. Establishes within the Office of the Secretary a National Office of Adoption Information and Services headed by a Director. Makes it the duty of the Director to (1) establish a national adoption data, tracking, and analysis system; (2) conduct a continuing adoption education program, including the making of grants, and the publishing of materials regarding adoption and adoption assistance programs; (3) conduct a program of grants and contracts for the demonstration of methods and programs to enable families having children placed in foster homes to care for such children in their own home; (4) prepare an annual report evaluating and measuring the impact of programs authorized by this Act including in such report (A) the total number of children placed in adoptive homes and the number of such children placed under adoptive assistance agreements; and (B) estimates of the number of children in foster care or other custodial institutions who have been in such institutions for at least six months; (5) ensure that federally assisted adoption agencies are in compliance with applicable rules and regulations; (6) notwithstanding any other provisions of law, ensure the operation of national adoption information system, utilizing computers and modern data processing methods, to assist in the location of children in need of adoption and in the placement in adoptive homes of children awaiting adoption, and for the promotion of cooperative efforts with any similar programs operated by or within any State; and (7) coordinate and consult with other appropriate Federal departments and agencies with respect to services and benefits provided under this Act. Directs the Secretary and Attorney General of the United States to jointly conduct a study to determine the nature, scope, and effect of the interstate placement of children in adoptive homes by unlicensed persons or agencies and to submit such study, together with any legislative recommendations, to Congress within two years after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 and of such sums as may be necessary for the succeeding three years."
