Rept. 95-1337) Amends the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to permit stockyard service rates based upon percentages of the gross sales prices of livestock, unless such rates are otherwise unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to utilize this revised standard in determining the legality of stockyard rates and practices. Requires the Secretary to prescribe corrective rates on any basis elected by the stockyard owner or market agency, unless such basis violates this revised standard. Directs the Secretary to appoint an interagency task force within the Department of Agriculture to analyze and recommend methods by which sellers may furnish lien or security interest information to purchasers and marketers of livestock. Requires that the Secretary submit a report of the findings and conclusion of such task force to the appropriate congressional committees by February 1, 1979."
