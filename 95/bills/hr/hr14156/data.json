    "text": "Loading - Unloading Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to stipulate that a motor carrier's duty to provide safe and adequate service shall not be construed to require a carrier to either load or unload perishable goods or goods exempt from such Act. Stipulates that motor carriers' tariffs may specify that the consignor shall load and unload shipments of exempt or perishable goods. Makes it a felony for persons engaged in loading and unloading perishable or exempt commodities to knowingly issue to the driver or carrier receipts for charges which contain false, fraudulent, or deceptive information regarding the identity of individuals performing such services. Makes it a felony for persons engaged in the operation of warehouses, parks, terminals, or distribution centers to knowingly permit any robbery, extortion, or extortionate practice in which drivers or carriers of transported property are subjected to threats of violence, physical damage, or undue delays with respect to the loading or unloading of any goods in facilities under their control."
