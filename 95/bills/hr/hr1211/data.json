    "text": "Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to revise the formula by which appropriations may be authorized for United States contributions to the United Nations and affiliated agencies, except the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Civil Aviation Agency. Prohibits the President from making payments to the United Nations in excess of such formula out of funds appropriated prior to this Act. Declares the sense of Congress that the President should direct the Ambassador to the United Nations to take steps to assure that assessments among the member nations take into consideration the wealth of the oil producing nations."
