Title II: Feed Grains - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide for the 1978 crop of feed grains a sliding-scale of established prices, keyed to voluntary five percent increments above the required acreage set-aside level, ranging from $2.10 for a ten percent set-aside up to $3.45 for a 50 percent set-aside. Title III: Upland Cotton - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide for the 1978 crop of upland cotton a sliding-scale of established prices, keyed to voluntary five percent increments above the required acreage set-aside level, ranging from 54 cents per pound for a 20 percent set-aside up to 84 cents per pound for a 50 percent set-aside. Title IV: Grain Release Prices - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949: (1) to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture from providing for the redemption of stored wheat and feed grains loans unless the market price for such commodities is not less than parity; (2) to prohibit the Secretary from calling such loans until the market price for wheat and feed grains is at least 105 percent of parity; and (3) to prohibit the Commodity Credit Corporation from selling its stocks of wheat and feed grains for less than the parity price of such commodities."
