    "text": "Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to establish a grant program for the purpose of making reimbursements to institutions of higher education to defray a portion of tuition costs, or costs of individual courses of study, applicable to eligible older persons at such institutions. Requires any institution of higher learning desiring to receive reimbursements from the Commissioner to transmit an application to the Commissioner in such form, at such times, and according to such procedures, as the Commissioner may establish. Sets forth assurances to be contained in such application. Provides that the United States courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction, concerning such application, to affirm or to set aside an adverse decision of the Commissioner. States that any older person who is qualified to enroll in any course of study at an institution receiving reimbursements under this Act shall be eligible for such enrollment without being required to defray any cost of tuition or any cost of a course of study. Entitles any institution of higher education whose application is approved to receive reimbursements equal to 55 percent of the cost of tuition or the cost of any study applicable to an older person with respect to whom such reimbursement is sought. States that reimbursements shall be made only for those students who constitute a greater number than those enrolled in 1978 who would have been eligible for benefits if the program were available. Defines the term \"older person\" as any person 60 years of age or older."
