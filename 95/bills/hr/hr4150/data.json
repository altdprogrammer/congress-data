Requires that such coupons be issued only to households having a gross annual income of less than $6,500. Restricts the use of such coupons to the payment of utility bills, or to the offset of rent due where a utility bill is not paid directly. In the latter case, requires a landlord to use such coupons to pay a portion of his utility bill and prohibits him from increasing rents in connection with or as a result of the issuance of energy stamps. Requires each State desiring to participate in the program to submit for approval a plan of operation, and directs each participating State to assume responsibility for the certification of eligible households."
