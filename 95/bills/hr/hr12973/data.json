    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Finance with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1306) Social Services Amendments - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to qualify employees who work with a child day care program on either a full-time or part- time basis as eligible employees for purposes of the tax credit allowed employers with respect to Federal welfare recipient employment incentive expenses. Permits, at the election of the taxpayer, a reimbursement of wages paid in connection with operating a child day care services program to the extent necessary to increase the tax credit of such employer to $1,000. Stipulates that these changes in the Internal Revenue Code be effective through calendar year 1983. Makes permanent the temporary provisions of Title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act relating to the authorization of funds for medical care associated with the initial detoxification of alcoholics and drug addicts. Amends Title XX to allow States to provide emergency shelter care for adults who are in need of this service as well as for children. Requires State officials to consult with local elected officials prior to the publication of a comprehensive service program plan under Title XX. Authorizes appropriations under Title XX for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands for fiscal year 1979 and succeeding years. Requires the Comptroller General to conduct a cost-benefit analysis which shall include: (1) the extent to which expenditures are meeting the purposes of Title XX; (2) an evaluation of the criteria which States use in determining the types of services to be furnished and the expenditures for such services under State services programs; and (3) the extent to which evaluative mechanisms are used to determine the cost-benefit effectiveness of funds used for social services and the extent to which such mechanisms are used to improve the cost-benefit effectiveness of programs. Directs the Comptroller General to submit recommendations for improving the cost-benefit effectiveness of State services programs. Amends Title IV, part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Seucrity Act and the Internal Revenue Code to permit States and localities to obtain access, with appropriate safeguards, to wage information contained in social security records for purposes of determing child support obligations of absent parents under the Child Support and Establishment of Paternity program. Authorizes the Social Security Administration to disclose certain tax return information to State and local child support agencies for purposes of the child support enforcement program. Authorizes officials of the Social Security Administration to disclose wage information to officers and employees of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and to State and local agencies for purposes of qualifying individuals for aid under Title IV; part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Security Act. Permits officials of agencies charged with the responsibility for administering State unemployment compensation to disclose wage information to State and local agencies for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment compensation. Amends Title IV, part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Security Act to authorize payment to States for the planning, design, development, or installation of an automatic data processing and information retrieval system to assist in the administration of the Child Support and Establishment of Paternity program. Sets forth the requirements for approval of the initial and annually updated advance automatic data processing planning document. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to continually review, assess, and inspect the planning, design, and operation of, the management information systems. Prohibits payment to any State for child support unless such State submits to the Secretary, within a prescribed time period, a complete report on the amount of child support collected and disbursed by such State."
