    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-04", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to guarantee loan obligations issued for the purpose of financing the construction and operational costs of commercial demonstration facilities for (1) the conversion of coal and other resources into synthetic fuels; (2) the generation of energy from renewable sources; (3) the development of energy-efficient industrial equipment; and (4) geothermal resource development. Requires the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the conditions of any such guarantee. Prescribes limits for the total amount of outstanding indebtedness subject to Federal guarantees. Details conditions under which the Administrator may guarantee an obligation. Authorizes the Administrator to provide Federal assistance for up to 75 percent of the total design and construction costs of modular facilities for the conversion of oil shale to synthetic fuels. Establishes procedures for consultation with affected States, localities and Indian tribes. Prohibits the making of Federal commitments where the Governor of the affected State is opposed unless there is an overriding national interest favoring such Federal action. Establishes a panel to advise the Administrator on matters relating to the impact of demonstration facilities on communities, States, and Indian tribes. Specifies procedures in the event of a default on any guarantee under this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to make financial payments to affected States, localities, and Indian tribes for the financing of essential community development, and planning resulting from the construction of any facilities assisted by this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 for grants to be used for such purposes. Requires full reports to Congressional committees on proposed Federal actions under this Act. Directs the Administrator to submit a comprehensive plan for energy production and conservation demonstration programs to the Congress. Establishes a separate fund in the Treasury to finance the programs authorized by this Act. Makes funds from the Geothermal Resources Development Fund available for loan guarantees for geothermal resource development and demonstration projects. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 to the fund for administrative expenses for fiscal year 1978, and from time to time such other amounts as may be necessary for administrative purposes. Requires employees and officials in policymaking positions within the Energy Research and Development Administration to file annual reports with the Administrator with respect to any financial interest in any property or business receiving financial assistance under this Act to which they may have knowledge. Imposes a fine of $2,500 and/or imprisonment of up to one year for violation of this Act by any employee or official of the Administration. Authorizes the Administrator to provide assistance in the form of price supports after September 1977 under price guarantee contracts designed to encourage the construction of synthetic fuels manufacturing facilities. Stipulates that such contracts shall guarantee that prices received for such fuels will remain at levels which make construction and operation of facilities economically feasible where market price levels are inadequate."
