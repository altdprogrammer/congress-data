Requires contractors to submit price data for analysis prior to any negotiated award, change, or modification of any contract valued at over $500,000 in order to facilitate determination of the reasonableness of its offers. Requires contractors party to a single-source award or negotiated contract to submit cost information bearing on the reasonableness of the offered price. Gives agencies the power to inspect plants and records of a contractor up to three years after final payment has been made under a contract to ascertain the accuracy of price and cost data submitted under this Act. Title IV: Acquisition by Competitive Small Purchase Procedures Method - Permits the use of the competitive small purchase procedures method of procurement when contracts valued at not more than $10,000 are involved and if such procedure would be advantageous to the Government.

Disallows the making of any contract for a period of more than five years unless an exception has been made by the Office under this Act. Sets forth limitations for the making of advance payments. Requires adequate security for partial and progress payments made pursuant to a Government contract. Title VI: Delegation of Authority - Permits agency heads to delegate specified authority conferred under this Act. Permits one agency to delegate acquisition functions to another agency to facilitate joint acquisitions.
