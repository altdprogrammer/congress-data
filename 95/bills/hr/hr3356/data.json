Directs each Federal financial supervisory agency to develop programs and procedures including the following: (1) requiring each applicant to analyze the deposit and credit needs of its primary savings service area and to specify how such applicant proposes to meet these needs; (2) permitting consumer organizations to present testimony at hearings on how well the applicant has met or is proposing to meet the credit needs of the communities served or to be served by the applicant; and (3) requiring periodic reports on the amount of consumer deposits received and credit extended in the institutions' primary savings service area."
