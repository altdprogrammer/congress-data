    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-03-07", 
    "text": "Airport and Aircraft Noise Reduction Act - Title I: Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a single system of measuring noise and the impact of noise on individuals to be used to measure noise at airports and their surrounding areas and to establish land uses for such areas which are compatible with such noise levels. Requires airports which handled 1,500 or more departures in the year prior to the enactment of this Act to submit noise contour maps to the Secretary. Specifies the information to be included in such maps. Requires airport operators to submit revised noise contour maps for any proposed changes in the operation of an airport if such change would create any new noncompatible use in any surrounding area. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to prohibit the Secretary from entering into grant agreements for airport development under such Act unless the sponsor of such a development project has submitted a noise contour map or a noise compatibility program setting forth measures to reduce the noncompatible uses of surrounding areas and to prevent the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to sponsors for such noise compatibility planning under such Act. Authorizes appropriationss of up to $15,000,000 out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for such purpose. Sets forth eligibility standards for noise compatibility planning grants. Authorizes airport operations to collect a maximum two dollar charge, directly or indirectly, from persons traveling in air transportation of which 75 percent must be used to carry out such noise compatibility program as approved by the Secretary. Conditions such authority upon the filing of a certificate by the operator stating that the zoning laws governing the area within the noise contour map prohibit the introduction of any new noncompatible uses within the area. Directs the Secretary to suspend such authority upon the introduction of any additional noncompatible uses or if the zoning laws are amended to permit such uses. Title II: Increases the authorized appropriations for the fiscal years 1978 through 1980 under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970. Title III: Directs the Secretary of Transportation to publish a list of owners of aircraft which do not comply with the noise standards prescribed for new subsonic aircraft in regulations issued by the Secretary as such regulations were in effect on January 1, 1977. Requires operators of such noncomplying aircraft to impose a two percent surcharge on any rates for carriage of persons and property and to deposit such surcharges into a separate account to pay for the retrofitting or replacement cost of such aircraft to meet such noise standards. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants available to operators of noncomplying aircraft when the amount of such surcharge is insufficient to meet the allowable retrofitting or replacement cost as prescribed in this Act. Prohibits the operation of foreign aircraft over a specified takeoff weight limit within the United States after January 1, 1985, unless such aircraft complies with the noise standards prescribed for subsonic aircraft in effect on January 1, 1977."
