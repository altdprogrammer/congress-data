    "text": "Water Conservation Amendments Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to declare it national policy that the Federal Government shall encourage methods to reduce the total flow of sewage and to reduce unnecessary water consumption. Requires each planning agency receiving a grant for the development of a comprehensive water pollution control program to develop a plan which promotes the reduction of unnecessary water consumption and of the total flow of sewage. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct research in cooperation with State and local government agencies in areas in which drought conditions or threat of drought conditions exist. Directs the Administrator to study methods of irrigation which will result in a reduction of the total flow of sewage and of unnecessary water consumption as part of the agricultural pollution control program. Directs the Administrator to study new methods for the installation of devices to reduce unnecessary water consumption and the total flow of sewage in rural areas. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into contracts and make grants for certain research and demonstration projects relating to the reduction of total sewage flow and unnecessary water consumption. Directs the Administrator to encourage waste treatment management resulting in the reduction of total sewage flow or of unnecessary water consumption, and to reduce grants for treatment works construction where the applicant has failed to demonstrate that methods for such reduction have been studied and adopted when feasible. Makes construction grants for treatment works contingent upon the fulfillment of certain requirements relating to the reduction of unnecessary water consumption. Requires any organization responsible for areawide waste treatment management planning processes to include in such plans a process to identify sources of unnecessary water consumption that contribute to water quality problems and to set forth methods for reduction of such consumption. Permits any State to identify any area in such State where there is a drought, threat of drought, or other condition occurring as a result of unnecessary water consumption, and to request the Administrator to assist in reducing such consumption. Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the making of certain loans for the purpose of installing devices to reduce unnecessary water consumption by small businesses."
