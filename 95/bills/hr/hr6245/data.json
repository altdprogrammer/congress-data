Permits the Administrator of Energy Research and Development to make a loan to a qualified applicant for the installation of solar energy equipment in new residential buildings. Specifies formulas for determining the maximum amount and the interest rate of such a loan, and sets a term at not more than 15 years. Establishes in the Treasury of the United States a solar energy equipment installation loan fund to pay for expenses incurred in carrying out the obligations of the Administrator under the loan program. States that amounts received in repayment of such loans shall be deposited in the installation fund."
