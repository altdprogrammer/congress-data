    "text": "Animal Welfare Act Amendments - Amends the Federal Laboratory Animal Welfare Act to: (1) subject the intrastate transportation of animals in commerce to the regulations of the Act; and (2) add \"intermediate handlers\" and \"common carriers\" to the class of persons or entities subject under the Act to certain licensing requirements, vicarious liability rules, recordkeeping procedures, investigations, and inspections. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate standards governing the treatment of animals transported in commerce. Specifies that no animal may be delivered by persons regulated under the Act to any intermediate handler or common carrier for transportation in commerce unless accompanied by a certificate issued by a veterinarian certifying that the animal is fit to withstand such travel. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the ages at which different kinds and classes of animals may be so transported. Prohibits transportation in commerce of any animal on a \"pay-on-delivery\" basis. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to disapprove any standard governing the air transportation of animals which interferes with flight safety. Prohibits the use of interstate commerce or the mails for activities involving dog or animal fighting. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations assuring the humane handling of livestock while being transported in interstate commerce."
