Stipulates that the royalties accruing to the United States from reserve leases shall be determined without regard to Federal, State, or local regulations controlling sales or allocation of petroleum products. Authorizes the Secretary to exercise condemnation authority with respect to the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 if production agreements are not reached within 90 days after the effective date of this Act."
