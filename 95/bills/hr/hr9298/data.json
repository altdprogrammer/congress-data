    "text": "Requires every temporary help service which supplies unskilled, nonsecretarial, nonclerical workers to obtain a license from the Secretary of Labor or his designee. States that no such temporary help service may be licensed unless it: (1) provides its employees with benefits under specified Acts, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947; and (2) conforms to such other standards as the Secretary may prescribe. Prohibits such a temporary help service from restricting the right of any of its employees to obtain permanent employment with a client. Forbids the use of such temporary help service employees as strikebreakers where a legitimate labor dispute is in progress. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress with respect to the implementation of this Act, including recommendations for extending unemployment insurance benefits to employees of such temporary help services."
