Makes it the responsibility of such Office to conduct and submit to Congress an evaluation of any economic impact statement which is published in or made available through the Federal Register by a Government agency. Defines an economic impact statement as a statement by a Government agency which analyzes: (1) the costs of an agency rule to that agency, consumers, businesses, and governments; and (2) the effects of such rule on employment, worker productivity, competition, the supply of products and services, and the general economy. Directs the Comptroller General to select the employees and director of such Office."
