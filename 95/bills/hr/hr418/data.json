    "text": "Makes it unlawful for any business enterprise to directly or indirectly coerce or attempt to coerce by economic means any person where a goal of such coercion is to cause employment discrimination against or economic loss to any United States person, or any foreign person with respect to activities in the United States, by reason of the race, religion, national origin, or sex of such person or any employee, agent, or creditor thereof. Makes it unlawful to so discriminate against or so subject to economic loss any such United States or foreign person by reason of, or in order to avoid, being coerced in a manner which is unlawful under this Act or which would be unlawful under this Act except for the fact that the coercion is exerted by a foreign government or by a business enterprise beyond the jurisdiction of the United States. Empowers any person aggrieved by coercion or an attempt to coerce in violation of this Act to bring a civil action in any United States district court and to recover threefold actual damages. Permits any person aggrieved by employment discrimination or subjected to economic loss in violation of this Act to bring a civil action against the person so discriminating for actual damages. Makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions, for any person or business enterprise to take any of specified actions with intent to comply with or further any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to, and not itself subject to any form of embargo by, the United States."
