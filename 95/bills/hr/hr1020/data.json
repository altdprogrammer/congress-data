Establishes criteria for the examination of all individuals operating as motor vehicle mechanics on the effective date of such program in each State and the training and examination, as a condition for licensing, of any individual not operating as a mechanic on such date. Establishes disciplinary procedures for those license holding individuals whose competence is called into question. Reduces Federal highway funds to any State not implementing an approved State motor vehicle mechanic licensing program. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to pay not more than 80 percent of the cost of any State motor vehicle mechanic licensing program."
