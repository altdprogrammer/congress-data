Specifies certain operating procedures for aircraft which shall be included in such regulations. Directs the Secretary to study the advisability of requiring the use of new flight instruments in the landing operations of civil turbojet powered aircraft to reduce noise and increase the safety of landing operations and to report the results of such study to Congress. Stipulates that no two or three engine civil turbojet powered aircraft having an engine bypass ratio of less than 1.5 shall be subject to any standard or regulation prescribed under any provision of law which permits the acoustic retrofit of such aircraft after a specified date."
