    "text": "Mining Law of 1977 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to regulate hardrock mineral prospecting on Federal lands through the issuance of prospecting licenses. Prohibits such prospecting without a license. Requires that licensees avoid any significant disturbance of the environment. Imposes criminal penalties for each day for violations of such requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to exclude Federal lands from prospecting, exploration, or development under this Act. Authorizes affected States and individuals to petition the Secretary to exclude or to revoke an exclusion under such provision. Authorizes the Secretary to issue exploration leases for hardrock minerals in accordance with prescribed criteria. Stipulates that such leases shall be issued without competitive bidding to the first qualified applicant, except that owners of valid claims under the Mining Law of 1972 shall have a preference right with respect to the area of such claim. Imposes limits on the amount of land which can be leased by an individual in a single tract or in a single State. Stipulates that holders of hardrock exploration leases shall be eligible for hardrock development and production leases. Specifies rental changes, royalties, and other conditions to be prescribed by the Secretary. Requires that leases issued under this Act be conditioned upon the prosecution of diligent operation. Authorizes the Secretary to issue leases by competitive bidding where conditions warrant. Requires lessees to develop an operation and reclamation plan subject to the approval of the Secretary prior to commencing operations which might cause a significant disturbance of the environment. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate such authority to the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to national forest lands. Directs the Secretary to prescribe environmental regulations in accordance with prescribed criteria to be utilized in evaluating the operation and reclamation plans. Requires that lessees specify a time schedule of projected performance in a development plan to be approved by the Secretary. Requires that any restrictions placed on the use of public access to leased lands be approved by the Secretary. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend operations or reduce royalties where necessary to further the purposes of this Act. Establishes procedures governing the cancellation, termination, or surrender of leases. Requires forfeiture of lands held or controlled by unlawful trusts or other devices which indicate a conspiracy in restraint of trade in the mining or selling of mineral resources. Repeals provisions of the Mining Law of 1872 which are superseded by this Act. Authorizes citizen suits in the United States district court (1) against alleged violations of rules or approved operation and reclamation plans or (2) against the Secretary for alleged failure to perform a nondiscretionary act or duty. Prohibits acquisition or control of exploration or development and production leases by persons, association, or corporations controlling mineral deposits in two or more of the following classes: (1) coal; (2) petroleum and natural gas; (3) geothermal steam; or (4) uraniums or other fissionable material. Prohibits acquisition of such leases by persons engaging in two or more of the following activities: (1) controlling deposits or producing petroleum or natural gas; (2) refining petroleum; (3) transportation of petroleum, natural gas, or coal by pipeline; or (4) marketing of petroleum products or natural gas."
