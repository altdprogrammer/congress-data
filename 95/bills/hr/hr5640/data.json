    "text": "Directs the Federal Energy Administrator to establish methods of determining the life cycle cost effectiveness for buildings, considering the life cycle fuel and energy requirements for such buildings. Requires that all Federal buildings be life cycle cost effective and that such determination serve as a basis for the awarding of contracts in the procurement and leasing of new Federal buildings. Directs the Administrator to promote the use of life cycle cost effective methods in all buildings. Directs the Administrator to establish energy performance targets for existing buildings which are compatible with new building performance standards developed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Requires all Federal agencies to conduct an energy audit of existing buildings within their jurisdiction. Requires that a specified percentage of the gross square footage of building space be selected by each agency for retrofitting with appropriate energy conservation measures. Authorizes the appropriation of $500,000 to the Administrator to perform the functions as authorized or required under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of additional sums as necessary to carry out this Act."
