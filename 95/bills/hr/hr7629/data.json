    "text": "Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Act - Establishes a photovoltaic energy commercialization program for the accelerated procurement of photovoltaic solar electric systems in new and existing Federal facilities, primarily for use by the Department of Defense. Authorizes the Federal Energy Administrator to make contracts for the acquisition of such photovoltaic systems to meet target levels specified in the Act. Directs the Administrator, together with the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration, to jointly establish a photovoltaic systems evaluation and purchase program designed to insure that such systems reflect the most advanced technology. Establishes an advisory committee to assist in the establishment and conduct of the program. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1977 through 1981 for design and engineering activities to carry out the program authorized by this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 for photovoltaic system acquisition."
