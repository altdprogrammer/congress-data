Requires the Comptroller General to refer to the House of Representatives Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for investigation of any payments reportable under this Act to any person under the jurisdiction of the Committee that exceed $100 in value in the aggregate in any calendar year to determine if the receipt of such expenditure is prohibited by the Rules of the House.
