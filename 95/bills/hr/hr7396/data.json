    "text": "Grants to the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service, under the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976, discretion as to the transactions and processes about which he shall require agencies and persons receiving official grain inspection or weighing services to maintain complete and accurate records. Reduces the amount of fees paid for inspection or weighing from 100 percent to 50 percent of the costs of direct inspection or weighing, or the direct supervision of personnel performing such functions by the field office personnel of the Federal Grain Inspection Service. Permits the Secretary of Agriculture to delegate authority to the Service to perform related functions for grain and similar commodities and products thereof under other statutes administered by the Department of Agriculture. Establishes a 12-member advisory committee to advise the Administrator with respect to the implementation of the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976. Requires such committee to terminate 18 months after the enactment of this Act. Amends specified provisions of such Act to: (1) delete the general exception to the provision limiting the number of official agencies for inspection or weighing to one for any geographic area; (2) authorize the Administrator to make exceptions to the general prohibition against the inspection by an official agency of grain samples not physically located within the geographical area assigned to such agency; and (3) provide for the collection of reasonable fees to cover the estimated costs to the Service incident to the testing of inspection and weighing equipment. Prohibits any person from knowingly making any false representation that any weighing service under such Act has been performed. Extends the deadline dates for submission to the appropriate Committees of Congress of reports on specified studies being conducted regarding the present grain inspection and weighing system. Specifies the factors which the Administrator must consider in making a determination with regard to a possible conflict of interest in the employment of personnel in inspection or weighing. Prohibits any person acting under a license or authorization to perform official functions under the United States Grain Standards Act from certifying or stating in writing or performing any analysis to determine: (1) the subclass of Hard Red Winter wheat on the basis of color or on the basis of the dark, hard, and vitreous kernel content; or (2) the percentage of dark, hard and vitreous kernels in Hard Red Winter wheat."
