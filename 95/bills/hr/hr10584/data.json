Limits such credit to: (1) the sale to a foreign country of grain necessary to establish or maintain a reserve stock pursuant to such country's obligations under any international grain agreement; or (2) the sale of breeding livestock, including the cost of export freight. =Title IV: Trade with Nonmarket Economy Countries= - Authorizes the Commodity Credit Corporation to extend credit, credit guarantees, and investment guarantees, not to exceed three years, directly or indirectly, to any eligible nonmarket economy country, on condition that such country: (1) purchases during the calendar year a quantity of any agricultural commodity which exceeds the average annual quantity of such commodity purchased by such country during the three-calendar-year period 1975 through 1977; and (2) give the Corporation reasonable assurances of repayment in accordance with the terms under which such credit is extended. =Title V: Reorganization= - Abolishes the position of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. Establishes in the Department of Agriculture the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs, appointed by the President. =Title VI: General Provisions= - Requires the Secretary to transmit to Congress annual reports on the activities and accomplishments of the Department, especially those of the United States Agricultural Trade Offices, in developing, maintaining, and expanding foreign markets for United States agricultural commodities. Directs the Secretary to appoint an interagency task force within the Department to analyze the effectiveness of the export sales reporting provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1970, and to report its findings and recommendations to the appropriate committees of Congress. Requires the Secretary, within six months after enactment, to report to Congress on the impact of this Act on American agriculture."
