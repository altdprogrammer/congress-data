    "text": "Natural Gas Act Amendments - Amends the Natural Gas Act to terminate Federal Power Commission authority to regulate sales of natural gas by independent producers whose aggregated market production does not exceed a specified amount. Authorizes the Commission to require reporting of natural gas reserves transfers to independent producers. Establishes procedures under which the Federal Power Commission is to establish national ceiling prices for sales of new natural gas to producers who are not independent producers. Authorizes the Commission to establish higher ceilings in areas involving high cost or high risk production. Directs the Commission to prohibit the use of natural gas as boiler fuel where adequate alternatives are available. Authorizes exemptions from such prohibition where necessary to comply with pollution control or environmental protection and safety standards. Directs the Commission to prohibit the curtailment of adequate supplies of natural gas for essential agricultural purposes. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to certify agricultural, food processing, or food packaging purposes for which natural gas is essential."
