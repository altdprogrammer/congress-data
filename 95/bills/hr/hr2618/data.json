Sets forth the duties of the Commission, including inquiry into the effect of Federal, State, and local laws with respect to victimless crimes on law enforcement, court correctional systems, and private citizens. Directs the Commission to conduct a survey of Federal, State, and local laws (including the financial cost of enforcement) and to consider the following: (1) whether such laws should be amended or repealed; (2) the manner in which such laws should be enforced; (3) whether some problems covered by such laws may better be dealt with outside of the criminal justice system; and (4) whether some problems covered by such laws may better be dealt with through an administrative regulatory apparatus."
