    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-09-08", 
    "text": "Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to establish within three years test procedures, labeling requirements, and energy efficiency standards for electric motors and pumps used for industrial or commercial purposes. Directs the Administrator to conduct a study of the practicability of establishing such requirements for other specified industrial equipment. Stipulates that the test procedures required under this Act shall be designed to produce results which reflect energy efficiency, energy use, and estimated operating costs of a type or class of industrial equipment during a representative average use cycle (as determined by the Administrator). Stipulates that the labeling requirements prescribed pursuant to this Act shall require that each article of equipment which is in the type or class of industrial equipment to which such rule applies disclose the energy efficiency of such article as determined by the testing procedures under this Act. Requires the Administrator to consult with the Federal Trade Commission before prescribing labeling rules pursuant to this Act. Stipulates that any labeling rules shall not apply to articles manufactured before the effective date of such a rule. Stipulates that the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Administrator shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Administrator determines is technologically feasible and economically justified. Stipulates that such a standard may be phased in over a period not exceeding five years through the use of interim standards. Establishes criteria which the Administrator must use in determining whether such a standard is economically justified. Requires the Attorney General, within 120 days after the publication of a proposed energy efficiency standard, to make an estimate of the standard's impact on competition. Establishes administrative procedures for the promulgation of energy efficiency standards. Makes it unlawful for manufactures to distribute equipment in commerce which is not in conformity with an energy efficiency standard. Prohibits a manufacturer or distributor from making any representation regarding the energy consumption or cost of a piece of equipment covered under this Act unless such equipment has been tested in accordance with the Administrator's test procedures and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing. Establishes civil penalties for violations of such requirements. Authorizes the Administrator to file suit in the appropriate United States district court to restrain individuals from violating the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that the standards and labeling requirements of this Act shall not apply to articles which are to be exported from the United States. Stipulates that articles of covered equipment offered for importation in violation of this Act shall be refused admission into the customs territory of the United States under rules established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the National Bureau of Standards to assist the Administrator in carrying out the provisions of this Act, including developing and recommending test procedures. Requires the Administrator to submit a report to the Congress on improvements in the energy efficiency of industrial equipment within two years. Authorizes appropriations of $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 to carry out the provisions of this Act relating to electric pumps and motors and $4,000,000 to carry out such provisions for such fiscal year with respect to all other types of industrial equipment."
