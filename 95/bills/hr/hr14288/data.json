    "text": "Individual Privacy Protection Act - Establishes criminal penalties for anyone who, acting under color of law and not incident to a lawful arrest, seeks evidence from a person other than through a subpoena duces tecum which such person has the opportunity to contest in a prior court proceeding. Permits issuance of a search warrant instead of a subpoena duces tecum only if a court finds probable cause to believe that: (1) the person in possession, custody, or control of the evidence has committed or is committing the crime to which the evidence relates; or (2) use of the subpoena duces tecum would lead to the destruction, concealment, or alteration of such evidence. Makes the fruits of such illegal searches and seizures inadmissible in any criminal proceeding. Creates a civil action in an appropriate United States district court for persons aggrieved by violations of this Act, without regard to diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy. Authorizes a court to award such persons appropriate relief, including general damages, equitable or declaratory relief, punitive damages up to $100,000, court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees."
