Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate guidelines for research involving DNA. Prohibits the granting of a patent on any procedure or organism resulting from such research unless all guidelines have been adhered to, and full disclosure has been made, regarding such process or organism. Imposes strict civil liability on persons carrying out such research for all injury to persons or property caused by such research. Authorizes the Secretary to issue licenses for research involving DNA. Prohibits any person from soliciting or accepting any specimen for research involving DNA or conducting such research unless a license for such research has been issued. Authorizes the Secretary to revoke, suspend, or limit such licenses for specified violations. Authorizes the Attorney General, at the Secretary's request, to bring suit to enjoin any activity by a research facility, licensed under this Act, which is believed by the Secretary to be unreasonably hazardous to the public health. Gives the Secretary authority to inspect facilities engaged in DNA research. Imposes criminal penalties for violation of this Act. Authorizes the court to render any person or entity convicted of such violation ineligible for Federal funds. Prohibits any research facility employer from discharging or discriminating against any employee because such employee is involved in a proceeding under this Act."
