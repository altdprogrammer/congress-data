Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to collect comparable information every five years using the statistical method known as sampling to the maximum extent possible and to take steps to reduce the burden on census respondents. Requires the Secretary to collect such information within the framework of a five year period, but on a continuing year to year basis and to consult with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration regarding methods to make such data available to small businesses and other agribusiness organizations on a timely and useful basis. Directs the Secretary to continue the statistical classification of farms in effect on January 1, 1975, for purposes of such census. Authorizes the use of additional classifications as may be appropriate. Prescribes criminal penalties for officers or employees of the Department of Agriculture who violate restrictions on confidentiality relating to such census information. (Repeals 13 USC 142)"
