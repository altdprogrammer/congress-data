Requires the Secretary to prepare an environmental impact statement for new safety or environmental consequences, not previously assessed, in connection with such facilities. Permits agreements for the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from licensed commercial powerplants to the new facilities. Sets forth the requirements of such agreements. Provides for a refund to persons delivering spent nuclear fuel should a facility for reprocessing become available."
