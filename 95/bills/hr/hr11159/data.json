Establishes in the Treasury a Commercial Fisheries Financing Fund to be used by the Secretary to make loans pursuant to this title. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund to provide capital for all loans under this Act. Amends the Fish and Wildlife Act to repeal the provision authorizing loans for commercial fishing vessels or gear, and to transfer all assets and liabilities of such loan fund to the Commercial Fisheries Financing Fund. Title II: Loan Guarantees - Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans for the construction, expansion, or rehabilitation of fisheries shoreside facilities, or the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of fishing vessels. Creates a Commercial Fisheries Loan Guarantee Fund to carry out the purposes of this title. Sets forth procedures to be followed by the Secretary in the event of a default on such loan."
