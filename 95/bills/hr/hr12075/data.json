Eliminates the support of research and training related to the social and behavioral aspects of aging from such mission. Amends the Public Health Service Act: (1) to eliminate the authority of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to include on the National Advisory Council on Aging such ex officio members deemed necessary; and (2) to require the Director of the National Institutes of Health, in lieu of the Secretary, to determine the area in and extent to which activities in support of the mission of the Institute will be carried out. Removes the requirement that studies be conducted into specified social, psychological, educational, and economic aspects of the aging process."
