    "text": "Airport and Aircraft Noise Reduction Act - Title I: - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a single system of measuring noise and the impact of noise on individuals to be used to measure noise at airports and their surrounding areas and to establish land uses for such areas which are compatible with such noise levels. Allows airport operators to submit noise impact maps to the Secretary setting forth the noncompatible uses in each area of the map, a description of the projected aircraft operations during 1985, and the ways in which such operations will affect such map. Requires the revision of such maps when changes in airports operations would create any new noncompatible use in areas surrounding an airport. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to qualified airports for noise compatibility planning. Defines \"noise compatibility planning\" as the preparation of noise impact maps and noise compatibility programs under this Act. Sets forth limitations regarding the amounts which may be obligated through such grant program. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1979 and beyond to carry out such grant program. Stipulates that noise compatibility programs filed with the Secretary pursuant to this Act shall include measures proposed by airport operators for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses with the area covered by the operator's noise impact map. Sets forth factors which the Secretary is to rely on in approving noise compatibility programs. Stipulates that the Federal share of an approved program shall be 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 to carry out such grant program. Requires the Secretary to prepare noise impact maps and noise compatibility programs for specified airports near the District of Columbia. Places additional legal proof requirements on a person suing for damages as a result of airport noise. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to determine the effectiveness of such airport noise compatibility planning. Title II: Increases specified appropriations authorized for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970. Increases from 80 to 90 percent the Federal share of approved projects under such Act for fiscal years 1979 and 1980. Requires prior approval by any incorporated village located within five miles of any general aviation airport located astride a line separating two counties within a single State before the Secretary may approve any runway construction or extension project for such airport. Title III: Directs the Secretary to publish a list of operators of United States civil subsonic turbojet powered aircraft above a specified weight which do not comply with noise standards prescribed for new subsonic aircraft in regulations issued by the Secretary and in effect on January 1, 1977. Requires operators of noncomplying aircraft to impose a surcharge on any rates for the carriage of persons or property for a five-year period and to deposit such surcharges into a separate account to pay for the retrofitting or replacement cost of such aircraft to meet such noise standards. Prohibits the operation of foreign subsonic turbojet aircraft over a specified takeoff weight limit within the United States after January 1, 1985, unless such aircraft complies with the noise standards in effect on January 1, 1977. Title IV: Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to authorize appropriations to carry out air navigation and traffic control safety demonstration projects."
