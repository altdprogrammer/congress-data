Stipulates that responsibility for certification of eligible households and issuance of stamps shall rest with the States, subject to the approval of the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to reimburse participating States for costs incurred in administering the program. Stipulates that the value of the utility stamp provided to a qualified household under this Act shall not be considered to be income or resources for any purposes under any Federal or State law. Declares that any landlord who accepts any part of his rental charges in utility service stamps shall be deemed to have agreed to stated conditions regarding increases in rent. Imposes criminal penalties for uses of utility stamps not authorized by this Act."
