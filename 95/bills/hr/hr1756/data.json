    "date": "1977-01-12", 
    "text": "Title I: Authorizations of New Budget Authority - Sunset Act - Sets forth a five-year schedule for review and reauthorization of all Federal programs according to budget function and subfunction as set forth in the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal year 1977. States that no program not specifically reauthorized by Congress pursuant to this Act shall continue to function after the review date set forth in such schedule. Excepts from the requirements of this Act specified programs such as health care services,general retirement and disability insurance, and Federal employment retirement and disability payments. Permits legislation authorizing Federal program review more often than every five years as required by this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to identify for Congress for each program being reviewed the type of budget authority such program has and those inactive programs for which no outlays have been made during fiscal years 1976 and 1977. Title II: Review of Programs - Requires the authorizing committees of the Senate and House of Representatives to conduct \"sunset reviews\" of all programs prior to the review date applicable to such program and to issue a report on the findings of such review. Sets forth guidelines for the content of such sunset reviews including the identification of programs with duplicative objectives and an assessment of the impact of eliminating the program or funding it at a lower level. Provides the authorizing committees with assistance from the Government Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research Service in carrying out such sunset reviews. Title III: Citizens' Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government - Establishes a Citizens' Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government to study and make recommendations on ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. Requires the Commission to submit its final report together with its findings and recommendations no later than September 30, 1980. Requires the Comptroller General to report once a year for two years after submission of the Commission's final report the status of actions taken as a result of the report. Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of its final report. Authorizes to be appropriated $12,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this title. Title IV: Tax Expenditures - Requires the Joint Committee on Taxation, after consultation with Secretary of the Treasury and the Budget Committees of the House and Senate, to prepare a reauthorization schedule for all tax expenditures, similar to the schedule set out in Title I for Federal programs, and to report its recommendations to the Committees on Ways and Means and Finance. Requires the Congress to take final action before the end of the 95th Congress on the schedule for tax expenditures. States that, following the adoption of the schedule, the Committees on Ways and Means and Finance are required to conduct \"sunset\" reviews of tax expenditures according to the schedule. Sets forth guidelines for such reviews similar to those set out in Title II for such programs. Title V: Miscellaneous - Requires Executive Department agency heads to submit to Congress (after the President has submitted his budget) a statement of that agency's request for new budget authority as transmitted to the Office of Management and Budget. Requires agency heads to furnish the authorizing committees of Congress information regarding supplemental budget requests and supplemental estimates of outlays. Provides for a one-year grace period for programs which have not been specifically reauthorized by the scheduled time."
