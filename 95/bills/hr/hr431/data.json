Prohibits conducting activities contrary to this Act and subjects violators to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress an annual report evaluating the implementation of this Act and making recommendations for legislation. States that whenever a performance standard for a class of X-ray system is prescribed, the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe a performance standard applicable to systems of such class prior to the effective date of such standard. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of inspection of all X-ray systems to which standards apply and which are in actual use in the United States.
