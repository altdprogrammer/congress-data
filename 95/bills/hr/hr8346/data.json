Extends from March 30, 1978, to March 30, 1980, the termination date for 50 percent emergency operating assistance for commuter rail service affected by the northwestern railroad reorganization. Provides operating assistance funds to rail commuter services which are not eligible for such emergency operating assistance. Authorizes the appropriations to $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1979 to pay the costs of operating rail passenger service."
