Establishes within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an Office of Rural Health. Authorizes the Director of such office to award grants, contracts, loans, and loan guarantees for projects to: (1) examine existing models of rural health care delivery; (2) determine such models applicability and transferability to other rural areas; and (3) assist in the study, planning, and development of rural health care delivery models. States that the Director shall: (1) provide liaison among all Federal agencies for the purpose of coordinating health care programs in rural areas; (2) provide technical assistance and advice for the development of rural health care delivery models; and (3) provide for the coordination of programs assisted under this Act with programs of the National Health Service Corps. Establishes in the Treasury a rural health care delivery loan guarantee and loan fund. Stipulates that the Director shall not approve an application for a loan or a loan guarantee under this Act unless he determines that the terms and conditions are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States. Establishes a Rural Health Care Advisory Committee composed of 11 members. Directs such committee to make recommendations to the Director with respect to overall planning, policies, objectives and priorities for the Office of Rural Health.
