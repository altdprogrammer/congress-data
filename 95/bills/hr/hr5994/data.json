States that for the 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981 crops: (1) the established price for each such rice crop shall be the established price for the crop immediately preceding the crop for which the price is established, adjusted in each year to reflect any changes in the index of prices paid by farmers for specified items; and (2) the loan rate for each such crop shall be established at such rate as bears the same ratio to the loan rate for the preceding year's crop as the established price for each such crop bears to the established price for the preceding year's crop. Requires that cooperators receiving payments for the 1978 through 1981 crops must have planted no less than 90 percent of their allotments. States that acreage on a farm not planted to rice because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or a condition beyond the control of the producer shall be considered to be acreage planted to rice."
