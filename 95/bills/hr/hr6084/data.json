Authorizes the Secretary to grant such funds as may be necessary to enable such State to acquire title to or interest in such streams and abating lands. Requires such State agency to show that it is able to acquire such interests, and that it will maintain the streams and their environs in their natural state as preconditions to the granting of funds under this Act. Permits any State receiving such assistance to regulate the use of such streams. Requires Federal agencies to limit their operations on and over lands within the watershed of any such streams for which assistance is granted under this Act. Requires any State receiving such assistance to appoint a citizens' advisory committee which shall make an annual report to the Secretary with respect to the status, fees, rules, supervisory practices and use of such streams. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
