    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-03-14", 
    "text": "Amends the National Labor Relations Act to stipulate that, subject to specified provisions, it shall not be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to participate in, or to induce an employee of a person primarily engaged in the construction industry at the site involved to participate in, a strike or other refusal to perform services which is (1) conducted at the site of the construction, alteration, or repair of a building other than a residential structure less than four stories, and (2) directed at any of several employers in the construction industry who bear certain contractual relationships with the employer of the organization's workers. States that, for the purposes of this Act, where Federal or State law required separate bids and direct awards for construction, the various employers awarded contacts shall not be considered for that reason alone to have a common contractor or be in the relationship of contractor and subcontractor. Prohibits common site strikes or picketing for specified purposes, including (1) to remove or exclude from such site any individual on the ground of sex, race, creed, color, or national origin; (2) to cause or attempt to cause discrimination on the basis of labor union membership; or (3) to force, require, or persuade any person to refrain or cease from dealing in products or systems of another processor or manufacturer. Requires a labor organization, before engaging in an activity permitted by this Act, to give prior notice to certain persons and receive written authorization from the national or international labor organization with which it is affiliated. Sets forth separate prerequisites in the case of activities to be conducted with respect to sites located at military installations or at Federal facilities or installations a major purpose of which is, or will be, the development, production, testing, or firing of munitions, weapons, missles, or space vehicles."
