Requires such plan to itemize, so far as is practicable, estimates of any reduction or increase in expenditures called for by such plan and to describe any improvements in management, delivery of Federal services, execution of the laws, and increases in Government efficiency which are expected as a result of such reorganization. States that such plan may not provide for the abolition of existing agencies or the creation of new ones. States that no such plan shall take effect which is not submitted to Congress within three years after the enactment of this Act. Makes a plan submitted pursuant to this Act effective at the end of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date of submission of such plan unless disapproved by either House within such period. Sets forth procedures for consideration of any disapproval resolutions."
