    "text": "Nuclear Antiproliferation Act -- Sets forth United States policy with respect to nuclear proliferation. Title I: United States Initiatives for International Nuclear Cooperation - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require the United States to take actions to assure a reliable international supply of nuclear fuel services. Directs that the United States initiate negotiations to establish (1) international criteria for nuclear materials and technology, and (2) adequate physical security measures. Directs the renegotiation of certain United States agreements for nuclear cooperation. Authorizes appropriations for contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency for nuclear materials safeguards. Directs the President to report to Congress on the establishment of international nuclear fuel services facilities. Directs the President to report to Congress on Government activities relating to nuclear nonproliferation. Directs the Administrator of Energy Research and Development to establish an international safeguards training program. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to revise procedures for approval of proposed agreements for cooperation. Sets forth procedures under which the Administrator of Energy Research and Development may enter into \"subsequent arrangements. Title II: Export Control - Grants the Nuclear Regulatory Commission authority to approve nuclear retransfers under agreements for cooperation. Continues the effectiveness of current regulations and licenses issued under such authority. Restricts the authority of ERDA to distribute special nuclear material without a license to small quantities for laboratory and emergency purposes. Makes it unlawful to produce special nuclear material or heavy water outside the United States except upon a determination by ERDA that such production is not inimical to common defense and security. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require that agreements for cooperation include (1) guarantees that any nuclear material transferred under such agreement shall not be used for a nuclear explosive device or for development of such device, and (2) guarantees that the cooperating party will consult with the United States to determine whether the agreement should be amended. Requires the Secretary of State to negotiate certain agreements for cooperation. Revises the procedure for submitting such agreements to the President. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit issuance of nuclear export license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until the Secretary of State has determined that the issuance of such license is not inimical to the common defense and security. Imposes certain interim licensing criteria on nuclear exports intended for civilian use, including application of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, prohibition against the use of such export for any nuclear explosive device, adequate physical security measures, and retransfer restrictions. Prohibits issuance of a nuclear export license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission without a Commission determination that such criteria will be adhered to by the recipient country. Makes such restrictions applicable to the distribution of special nuclear material by the Administrator of Energy Research and Development. Establishes certain permanent licensing criteria for nuclear exports which include inspection and monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Permits the President to suspend all or some of the criteria for nuclear exports as applied to a recipient country, if the President determines that the application of such criteria would increase the capability of the recipient to produce a nuclear explosive device or would have a serious adverse impact on vital United States interests. Permits the Congress to disapprove suspension of such criteria by the President."
