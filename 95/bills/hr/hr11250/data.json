Limits the meaning of \"fee\" to any consideration in excess of the actual cost of providing farm labor contractor services. Deems such a contractor an employer of the migrant workers he or she has recruited or transported if he or she is responsible for the payment of their wages, any required deductions from wages, and their supervision, and has sole authority to hire and discharge such workers."
