    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #553 (325-67)) Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Energy for Energy Research and Development. =Title I: Advanced Energy Technologies and Energy Conservation Research and Development, and Related Activities= - Authorizes funds for the operating expenses of projects concerning energy supply, fuels from biomass, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power and basic energy sciences. Authorizes funds for specified projects concerning energy conservation, high energy physics, nuclear physics, and advanced technology and assessment. Authorizes funds for plant and capital equipment expenditures concerning specified solar, basic energy sciences, high energy physics, and nuclear physics projects. Supplements the previous authorizations for specified plant and capital equipment projects. Requires prior Congressional approval before authorized funds are expended for a fuel cell feasibility demonstration concerning cogeneration of steam and electric power. =Title II: Fossil and Nuclear Energy Research and Development, and Related Activities= - Authorizes funds for the operating expenses of specified fossil energy and nuclear energy programs. Authorizes funds for plant and capital equipment expenditures concerning specified coal, breeder reactor development, and program management and support activities. Supplements specified program management and support activities authorization. Directs the Secretary of Energy to make a detailed study of the uranium/plutonium cycle and the uranium/thorium cycle breeder reactors. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress at specified times concerning the results of such study. =Title III: Environment Research and Development, and Related Activities= - Authorizes funds for specified environmental research projects. =Title IV: Other Energy Research and Development, and Related Activities= - Authorizes funds for specified advanced energy technologies and energy conservation, fossil and nuclear energy, environment, and other programs. Supplements previous authorizations for specified programs. Prohibits the expenditure of funds for projects that exceed, by specified limits, their estimated cost. =Title V: General Provisions= - Prohibits the expenditure of funds on projects whose cost exceeds, by specified amounts, the amount authorized for such projects. Amends the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to direct the Assistant Secretary of Energy for the Environment to collect all appropriate information concerning federally sponsored energy-related environmental, health, and safety research for inclusion in the inventory of Federal Energy-Related Environment and Safety Research. Transfers specified duties to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from the Council on Environmental Quality. Expands such duties to require a continuing analysis of the adequacy, applicability, and effectiveness of the environmental control technology development and research programs in meeting the environmental standards and regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to annually report to Congress concerning such analysis along with his recommendations for improvements. Requires the Secretary of Energy to make available all information on the environmental control technology research and development activities and programs of the Department to the Administrator for such report. Directs the Secretary of Energy to annually review the energy control technology research activities of the Environmental Protection Agency and report the results of such review to Congress. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to direct that annual budget requests place all plant and capital equipment construction costs in specified categories. Limits cost overruns on specified plant and capital equipment construction projects. Directs the Secretary to provide realistic and adequate opportunities for small businesses to participate in civilian energy research and development programs. Requires the Secretary to periodically report to Congress concerning small business participation in designated programs. Directs such reports to include details on steps being taken to assure small business participation in the future. Stipulates that funds appropriated to the Department pursuant to this Act shall be used solely for research and demonstration unless otherwise provided for in such Act. =Title VI: Amendments to the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974= - Amends the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974 to extend from five to eight years the period allowed for development and demonstration purposes under the Act. =Title VII: Definition of Research and Development= - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to define \"research and development\" for purposes of such Act and specified other Acts."
