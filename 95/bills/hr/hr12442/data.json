    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1164) Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to extend through fiscal year 1981 the authorization of appropriations for carrying out such Act. Authorizes the Consumer Product Safety Commission to develop proposed consumer product safety standards on its own without an invitation to entities outside the Commission if the Commission finds that it is in the public interest to do so. Sets forth guidelines to determine when it is in the public interest to develop such standards. Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act by authorizing the Commission to apply the provisions of this Act to any product for export upon the determination that the exportation of such product presents an unreasonable risk of injury to consumers within the United States. Requires any person exporting any consumer product which is: (1) not in conformity with an applicable consumer product safety standard in effect under this Act or a proposed standard published in the Federal Register or (2) declared to be a hazardous product, to give the Commission 30 days advanced notice of such exportation. Requires the Commission to: (1) notify promptly the involved foreign government of such exportation and the standard with which such product is not in conformity; and (2) publish specified information on such exportation in the Federal Register. Makes the failure to file such a statement with the Commission a prohibited act and subject to civil penalties. Amends the Federal Hazardous Substances Act by eliminating a substance's exemption from the provisions of the Act if the Commission determines that exportation of such substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to persons residing within the United States. Provides that any person exporting any misbranded hazardous substance or banned hazardous substance must give the Commission 30 days advance notice of such exportation. Permits persons exporting such substances to file a petition for an exemption from the 30 day requirement. Stipulates that a statement must be filed no later than ten days before the date of shipment. Requires the Commission to publish a notice in the Federal Register indicating such a statement has been filed. Makes violaters subject to civil penalties. Amends the Flammable Fabrics Act to require any person exporting any fabric deemed unsafe to persons residing in the United States and nonconforming to an applicable flammability standard or regulation to file within 30 days with the Commission notification of such exportation. Requires publication in the Federal Register of such notification. Allows the Commissioner to exclude from such published notice any information judged to be a trade secret or privileged or confidential. Makes willful vioaltors guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to civil penalties."
