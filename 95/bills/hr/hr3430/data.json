Defines the terms used in this Act. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to establish in the Department of Labor a National Employment Relocation Administration, to be headed by an Administrator and Deputy Administrator appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to perform enumerated functions in order to carry out the purposes of this Act. Establishes a National Employment Relocation Advisory Council. Directs the members of such Council to perform enumerated functions, including to advise the Secretary and Administrator with respect to the activities of the National Employment Relocation Administration and to evaluate the effectiveness of programs carried out under this Act. Requires written notice to be given to the Secretary whenever: (1) a business concern intends to close or transfer all or part of the operations of an establishment of that business concern; and (2) at least 15 percent of the employees who are members of any labor organization or 15 percent of all employees in that establishment will suffer an eligible employment loss as a result of any such closing or transfer. Authorizes the Secretary to investigate a proposed closing or transfer of operations under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of adjustment assistance for employees who become unemployed or receive a weekly wage of less than 85 percent of their former wage as a result of a closing or transfer of a business concern. Provides that such adjustment assistance shall include: (1) income maintenance payment; (2) maintenance of pension and health benefits; (3) job placement and retraining benefits; (4) relocation allowances; (5) early retirement benefits; (6) emergency mortgage and rent payments; and (7) food stamps and surplus commodities. Directs the Secretary to make every effort to place employees for substantially equivalent full employment in accordance with their capacity and prospective employment opportunities. Provides that a unit of local government is eligible for assistance under this Act upon determination by the Secretary that the closing or transfer of operations of business establishments has contributed substantially to an unemployment rate within such jurisdiction exceeding eight percent on a seasonally adjusted basis. Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to businesses within such areas. Authorizes the Secretary to develop a retraining program for employees who will be required to acquire new or additional skills as a result of the economic adjustment assistance proposal. Makes business concerns ineligible for specified benefits under the Internal Revenue Code if the Secretary makes certain determinations. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
