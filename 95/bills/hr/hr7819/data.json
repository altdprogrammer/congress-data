Rept. 95-1108) Diplomatic Relations Act - Repeals provisions relating to diplomatic immunity which (1) deem void judicial writs or process issuing against persons with diplomatic immunity, (2) impose penalties for wrongful suit, and (3) exempt certain servants of diplomatic personnel from immunity. Extends the privileges and immunities specified in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to diplomatic personnel and families from nations which have not ratified the convention. Permits the President to grant to diplomatic personnel privileges and immunities more or less favorable than those in the Convention. Directs any judicial action brought against immune personnel to be dismissed by a motion or suggestion by or on behalf of the individual or as otherwise permitted by law or applicable rules of procedure. Requires such personnel to have liability insurance. Permits civil actions in district courts by any person against liability insurers of diplomatic mission members and their families or individuals covered by the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities. Requires that such actions be tried without a jury. Prohibits such insurers from using specified defenses arising from the immunity of the insured."
