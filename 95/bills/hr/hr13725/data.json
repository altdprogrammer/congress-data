    "text": "Endangered Species Act Amendments - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to restate the findings of Congress and to declare that in any determination of threatened or endangered species status it is the policy of the United States to protect the species to the maximum extent practicable while providing for a balancing of interests between the benefits to be derived from man's activities and the continued survival of the species. Redefines the term \"conservation\" to mean the use of methods which are prudent and reasonable to save an endangered species, rather than methods which are necessary. Eliminates natural occurences affecting the continued existence of a species as a factor that can be considered by the Secretary of the Interior in deciding whether a species is endangered. Directs the Secretary to determine the critical habitat of any endangered species and defines critical habitat for such purpose. States that no species shall be listed as endangered or threatened until the Secretary has prepared an economic impact statement which includes specified analyses of the economic impact of a decision to list a species as endangered or threatened. Provides that the determination to list a species as endangered shall be deemed to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Establishes an Endangered Species Committee. Directs the Committee to review applications submitted by Federal agencies regarding proposed agency actions to determine whether an exemption from the requirement of the Act that Federal agencies take no actions which would jeopardize endangered species or their critical habitats should be granted. Stipulates that such an exemption may be granted only after a public hearing and findings that: (1) there is no reasonable and prudent alternative to the agency action; (2) the action is of regional or national significance; (3) the economic benefits of the action clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or its critical habitat; and (4) the action is in the public interest. States that no final determination of the Committee regarding an exemption shall be considered a major Federal action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. Authorizes the President to grant exemptions from the Act in any area which he has declared to be a major disaster area under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 specified findings are made. Stipulates that no civil penalties shall be imposed under the Act, and that it is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the Act, if a defendant can show that he committed the act which is a violation with a good faith belief that he was acting to protect any human being from any endangered or threatened species."
