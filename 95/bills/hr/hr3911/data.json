Defines the term \"small producer\" to include independent producers: (1) not affiliated with natural gas pipeline companies or larger producers; (2) whose total sales do not exceed 10 million Mcf per year; and (3) whose average production per well does not exceed 100 Mcf per day on an annual basis."
