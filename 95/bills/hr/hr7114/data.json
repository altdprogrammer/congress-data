Prohibits a franchisor from cancelling a franchise or failing to renew a franchise unless the franchisor is effecting a market area withdrawal or the franchisor has good cause for failure to renew and has given proper notice. Makes any franchisor who has violated the requirements of this Act civilly liable to the aggrieved franchisee."
