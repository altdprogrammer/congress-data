    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to prohibit the use of Federal financial aid to provide job training or employment opportunities to aliens who are not authorized to work or who are illegally in the United States. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit income tax deductions for wages paid to aliens illegally working in the United States. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the Secretary of Labor, when adjudicating the petition of an alien for admission to perform skilled or unskilled labor, from considering the work experience gained by the alien in the United States during any time while in an immigration status in which employment was not authorized for the alien. Authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles, and aircraft used to illegally transport aliens into the United States. Sets forth exceptions to such seizure and forfeiture provision, including a vessel, vehicle, or aircraft used as a common carrier unless the owner or other person in charge was at the time of the alleged illegal act a consenting party or privy thereto. Amends the Social Security Act to prohibit the payment of Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits and Medicaid benefits to illegal aliens. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents proscribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by fine or imprisonment or both."
