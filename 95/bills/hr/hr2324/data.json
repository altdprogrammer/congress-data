Entitles each State having any portion of a free or toll highway bridge or tunnel which is part of the Interstate System to receive additional funds from the Highway Trust Fund for the removal of such toll facilities and the completion of the Interstate System within such State. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to deliver to Congress an estimate of the September 30, 1978, depreciated value of toll and free facilities incorporated in the Interstate System. Specifies criteria for determining such depreciation value. Allows a reimbursement of 90 percent of such depreciated value which remove tolls or presently operate free highway facilities Decreases Federal-aid highway apportionments for States not electing to eliminate tolls from facilities within the Interstate System.
