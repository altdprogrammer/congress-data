Permits payment of VA benefits by means other than checks. Requires the VA, when practicable, to schedule delivery of benefit payments for Fridays when regular delivery would fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. Requires a report to Congress on the implementation steps for such mail delivery. States that nothing in the provision of law which permits the Administrator of the Veterans' Administration to sue and be sued in his official capacity shall be construed as authorizing garnishment or attachment against the Administrator, the VA, or any of its employees. =Title V: Effective Date Provisions= - Declares that, except as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall become effective on October 1, 1977."
