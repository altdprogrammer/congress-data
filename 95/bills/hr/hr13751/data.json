    "text": "Sugar Stabilization Act - Title I: International Sugar Agreement - Authorizes the President to limit the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption in the United States, of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization, and otherwise to regulate foreign trade in sugar to implement the International Sugar Agreement. Establishes civil penalties for the violation of such regulations. Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual report on the Agreement. Title II: Domestic Sugar Program - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to determine, during the July preceding the commencement of each (October 1 to September 30) sugar supply year, the amount of sugar needed to meet the requirements of consumers in the United States. Sets the price of 16 cents per pound of sugar, raw value, delivered to New York (including freight and the applicable tariff and fees) as the price objective for the sugar supply year 1978. Establishes formulae for determining the price objectives for succeeding sugar supply years. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to establish, and to adjust, a quota for the entry of sugar from foreign countries; and (2) to impose an import fee in order to attain the established price objective. Prohibits filling of the established quota by direct-consumption sugar, except in specified circumstances. Permits the Secretary to suspend such quota and fees under specified circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary to impose a quota on the entry of sugar-containing products. Prohibits: (1) the entry of sugar, liquid sugar, or sugar-containing products after the import quotas have been filled; (2) the importation of certain sugar or liquid sugar into the Virgin Islands in excess of 100 pounds annually; and (3) the exportation of certain sugar from the United States. Regulates the exportation of sugar. Sets forth items to which the sugar quota shall not apply. Title III: General Provisions - Requires every producer of sugar beets and sugarcane for sugar to pay a specified minimum wage to each person employed on the farm in the production, cultivation, and harvesting of such crops. Establishes a civil cause of action against any producer who fails to pay minimum wages, allowing the employees affected to collect the amount of unpaid wages, plus an equal amount as liquidated damages. Prohibits a producer from discharging or discriminating against any employee who has participated in any way in an investigation or proceeding against the producer under this title. Prohibits a producer from charging farm employees any amount in excess of the reasonable cost of furnishing goods or services customarily furnished to employees engaged in the production. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to assure that producers furnish workmen's compensation insurance to such employees. Requires persons engaged in the manufacture, marketing, transport, or industrial use of sugar to furnish the Secretary with specified information. Prohibits investment in sugar by officials engaged in the administration of this Act, and establishes penalties for the violation of such prohibition. Authorizes the President to suspend the operation of Title II of this Act in a national emergency. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to conduct surveys and investigations to carry out this Act; and (2) to announce a daily spot price for raw sugar in specified circumstances. Terminates the authority of the Secretary under this Act on September 30, 1983."
