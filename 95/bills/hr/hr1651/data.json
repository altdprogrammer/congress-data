    "text": "Federal Animal Damage Control Act - Declares it the policy of Congress that programs for the prevention of damage to domestic livestock and agricultural resources caused by predatory animals should be administered in a manner consistent with principles of wildlife management and environmental quality. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a program of research with respect to the management and conservation of predatory and depredating animals and the abatement of damage caused by such animals. Authorizes for such purposes $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1978-1982. Authorizes the Secretary to grant financial assistance to any State for the administration within the State of a program for the management of predatory and depredating animals. Sets forth the criteria a State program must meet in order to be eligible for such assistance. Prohibits the Secretary from authorizing the emergency field use of any chemical toxicant unless (1) the emergency cannot otherwise be dealt with, and (2) the State program contains satisfactory assurances that only authorized State persons will use and apply such chemical toxicant and that such persons are competent in the handling of such toxicant. Prescribes limitations on the amount of payment made to any State. Directs the Secretary to encourage the States to provide instruction and assistance to farm operators in techniques designed to prevent depredations on domestic livestock and crops, and eliminate the individual animal causing damage instead of eliminating the population of predatory and depredating species. Prohibits (1) the field use of any chemical toxicant on any Federal lands for the purpose of killing predatory animals, or (2) the field use on such lands of any chemical toxicant that causes any secondary poisoning effect. Excepts from such provisions specified Federal authorities who may carry out use of chemical toxicants only if such use is essential for (1) the protection of human health or safety, (2) the preservation of any species or subspecies of fish or wildlife, (3) the prevention of substantial irretrievable damage to nationally significant resources, or (4) the prevention or reduction of major damage to domestic livestock. Establishes penalties for violation of the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the head of any Federal agency to modify, suspend, or revoke any lease, license, permit, or other agreements authorizing the grazing of domestic livestock on Federal lands for violation of this Act. Directs the Secretary to submit reports to the President and the Congress setting forth actions and evaluations of such actions taken under this Act. Directs the Secretary to undertake a feasibility study of implementing a Federal insurance program to provide reimbursement to owners for damage and other losses caused to domestic livestock by predatory and depredating animals. Authorizes the appropriation of $100,000 to carry out such purpose. Stipulates that no provision of this Act may be deemed to prohibit, or otherwise restrict, any manufacturer or producer from making available, under conditions and requirements prescribed by the Administrator, sodium cyanide or any chemical substances to any authorized State agency or Federal agency. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956. Authorizes the appropriation for each of the fiscal years 1978-1982 such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
