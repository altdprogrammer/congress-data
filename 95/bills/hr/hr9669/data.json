Amends the Housing and Community Development Act to entitle a grant recipient to an additional grant for the construction or maintenance of a senior center providing recreational, health, and nutritional services, regardless of whether such centers offer housing facilities. Directs the Secretary to prescribe eligibility requirements for block grants for senior centers. Redefines the term intermediate care facilities for purposes of the National Housing Act to include facilities that permit day health care services to the extent necessary to serve the needs of elderly persons served by the facility."
