Establishes procedures for the adjudication of claims for damages attributable to the dumping of sewage sludge by the Administrator. Specifies those damages which qualify for compensation under this Act. Establishes a Sewage Sludge Damage Claims Fund in the Treasury of the United States to pay such compensation. Imposes a dumping assessment against persons issued permits for the dumping of sewage sludge to be deposited in the Fund. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1978 and 1979 to administer the provisions of this Act."
