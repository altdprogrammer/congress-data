Revises Board quorum requirements to reflect such increased membership. Directs the Board to establish procedures pursuant to which a quorum of a designated three-member group may summarily affirm a decision of an administrative law judge regarding an alleged unfair labor practice. Revises criteria for organizations which may represent guards to allow designation of an organization which represents nonguard employees of other employers. Sets forth procedures for expedited selection of bargaining representatives where an employee, group of employees, or representative thereof files a petition stating that (1) a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit has designated a representative which the employer refuses to recognize and (2) there is no representative currently certified or recognized with respect to any employees in the bargaining unit. Denies for a three-year period, unless there is no alternative source, public contracts to persons willfully violating final orders regarding unfair labor practices. Specifies damages available to employees when (1) there is employer discrimination based on union membership resulting in deprivation of employment during certain periods or (2) there is an unlawful refusal to bargain prior to entry into a first bargaining contract."
