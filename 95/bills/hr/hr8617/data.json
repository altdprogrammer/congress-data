    "text": "Denies veterans' benefits retroactively to any individual whose entitlement is based on an upgraded discharge under specified revised standards not made applicable to all persons administratively discharged or released from active service under less than honorable conditions. Requires the board of review to make a separate determination whether an upgraded individual would have been awarded an upgraded discharge under discharge review standards made applicable to all persons administratively discharged under less than honorable conditions. Entitles to veterans' benefits any individual whose upgraded discharge would have been awarded under previous unrevised review standards. Denies benefits as of the date of enactment for any disability incurred or aggravated during a period of service from which a veteran was discharged by reason of a bad conduct discharge. States that the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs should not promulgate any new or revised regulations providing any unique or special advantage to veterans who have received upgraded discharges under revised standards, or otherwise make any special distinction between such veterans and other veterans. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should take all necessary action to provide that less than honorable discharges and releases of former members of the Armed Forces with respect to any period of war be reviewed under specified revised standards, if they have not been so reviewed previously."
