Stipulates that worker's compensation laws or similar State statutes shall not act as a bar to such a suit. Permits the defendant in a subrogation suit brought by an employer under workers' compensation laws or similar State statutes to raise as a defense the employer's contributory fault if such fault involves failure to comply with any Federal, State or common law requirements concerning industrial safety."
