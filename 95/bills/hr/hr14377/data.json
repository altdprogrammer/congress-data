States that such reversion shall occur upon such individual's written request, accompanied by payment of the lesser of the current market value of such property or the amount which was paid to the individual for such property. States that for any property returned as provided by this Act, the Federal Government shall reimburse State or local governments for the taxes which would have been charged to an individual for such property during the period of its Federal ownership."
