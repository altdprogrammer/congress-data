    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-26", 
    "text": "Mobile Source Emission Control Amendments - Amends the Clean Air Act to postpone until model year 1982 motor vehicle emission standards which require a 90 percent reduction in emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Established the following interim emission standards for such pollutants: (1) for model years 1977 through 1979, 1.5 grams per vehicle mile for hydrocarbons and 15 grams per vehicle mile of carbon monoxide; and (2) for model years 1980 and 1981, 0.9 grams per vehicle mile of hydrocarbons and 9 grams per vehicle mile of carbon monoxide. Extends until model year 1981 the current 2.0 gram per vehicle mile interim standard for nitrogen oxide emissions from light-duty vehicles. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish such standards as appropriated for future model years. Directs the Administrator, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Federal Energy Administration to submit separate reports to Congress regarding the consequences of such emission standards on fuel consumption. Establishes additional prohibitions and penalties for tampering with motor vehicle emission control equipment. Imposes limits on the amount of vehicle testing required of small manufacturers. Establishes procedures for review of instructions for high altitude performance adjustments for motor vehicle emission control systems by the Administrator in accordance with specified requirements. Revises warranty requirements stipulated by the Act. Specifies on 18-month or 18,000 mile warranty requirement for the useful life of motor vehicle emission control systems. Directs the Administrator to study the effects of emission of sulfur-bearing compounds from motor vehicles and aircraft. Directs the Administrator to establish emission standards for air pollutants from railroad locomotives. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to make inspections to insure compliance with such standards. Prohibits States and localities from adopting different standards. Extends the exception for disclosure of confidential information in administrative and judicial procedures to emission data upon a satisfactory showing to the Administrator that such data would divulge trade secrets. Requires that documentation, justifications, proposed drafts, and comments of other agencies on proposed motor vehicle emission standards be made available to the public once such standards are proposed. Establishes procedures for oral presentation of views, with opportunity for cross-examination, with respect to such standards. Authorizes direct review of alleged procedural errors in the appropriate United States court of Appeals. Authorizes the appropriation of $200,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980, to carry out the purposes of this Act other than research, development, and demonstration activities."
