Directs the Secretary of Commerce to take steps to reduce the overall burden on respondents in the 1979 census to no more than one-half the overall burden on respondents in the 1974 census and to report to Congress on the steps thus taken. Declares that the statistical classification of farms in effect on June 30, 1976, shall be effective for purposes of the 1974 census. Declares that the statistical classification of farms effective with respect to the census taken in 1979 and thereafter shall be prescribed so as not to exclude any establishment which has sold or would normally sell more than $250 (adjusted by a certain percentage) of agricultural products during the census year. Directs the Department of Commerce, in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, to improve the collection, analysis and publication of data about the ownership structure of farms in the United States, and to collect, analyze, and publish such data."
