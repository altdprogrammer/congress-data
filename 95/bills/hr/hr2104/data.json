    "text": "Public Participation Act - Authorizes the award of attorney's fees and other costs of public participation in proceedings for the promulgation of standards or other regulations under the Flammable Fabrics Act; labeling requirements or other regulations under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act; and orders under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. States that such reimbursement will be made if the appropriate agency determines that the participant applying for such reimbursement represents an interest which would substantially contribute to a fair determination of the issues to be resolved in the proceeding and that either the economic interest of such person in the outcome of the proceeding is small compared to the costs involved or that such person does not have sufficient resources adequately to participate in the proceeding without compensation under this Act. Permits the decision of a court in specified civil actions under such Acts to award cost of participation to a party to such action if the court thinks such award is appropriate."
