    "text": "Debt Collection Practices Act - Prohibits debt collectors from harassing or intimidating consumers in connection with the collection or attempted collection of any alleged debt arising from a consumer credit transaction. Sets forth conduct violating this Act, including the use of violence by a debt collector, or publication of a list of consumers who allegedly refuse to pay debts. Prohibits communication with any person other than the consumer owing the debt or the spouse without prior consent of the consumer. Prohibits false or misleading representation or impersonation in connection with the collection of an alleged debt. States that no debt collector may engage in unfair practices, such as soliciting a post-dated check for purposes of threatening criminal action. Prohibits debt collectors from taking specified legal actions, such as causing unauthorized service of process. Requires a debt collector to keep at each office he maintains specified information regarding his accounts. Provides that each debt collector must disclose, clearly and accurately, to each consumer a list of information which includes the date the alleged debt was incurred and the original creditor. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to report periodically to Congress concerning their administration of functions delegated to them under this Act."
