Requires the Corporation, in making grants, to determine reporting and management restrictions or requirements on recipients and to assure that recipients make information necessary to determine compliance with Federal laws available to the Corporation. Enumerates the Corporation's powers, including the power to invest funds of the Corporation. Authorizes specified Federal departments and Federal banks to provide services to the Corporation with or without reimbursement. Directs the Corporation to publish an annual report to the President and the Congress. Requires an annual audit of the Corporation.
