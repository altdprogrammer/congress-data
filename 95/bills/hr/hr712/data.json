    "text": "Energy Transportation Security Act - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to direct the Secretary of Commerce to assure that 20 percent of the gross tonnage of oil transported in bulk on ocean vessels for import into the United States shall be carried on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels, provided that the Secretary finds that such United States vessels as are available will be adequate to carry such quantity. Raises the requirement to 25 percent after June 30, 1978, and to 30 percent after June 30, 1980. Requires the Secretary to make annual reports to the Congress and the President on the implementation of this Act. Exempts from the provisions of this Act refineries whose capacity is less than 30,000 barrels per day."
