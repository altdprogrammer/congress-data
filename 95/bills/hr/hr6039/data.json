Directs the Secretary to take into account in making such a determination (1) all scientific data and information on the additive; (2) the scientific validity, analysis, and other conditions concerning the animal testing of such additive; and (3) current knowledge about the reliability of predicting cancer in humans from use of an additive found to induce cancer in animals."
