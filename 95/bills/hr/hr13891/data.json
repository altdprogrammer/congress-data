Prohibits the treatment of any individual as an employee of any employer, if such employer consistently treated the individual, in good faith, as an independent contractor in reasonable reliance on either past IRS audit practice, published rulings or judicial precedent, recognized practice in the industry, or long-standing treatment of the individual as an independent contractor."
