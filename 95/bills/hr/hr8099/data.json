    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #517 (292-80)) Declares it the policy of the Congress to settle water claims of the AK-Chin Indian community of Arizona without costly litigation. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a feasibility study to determine if sufficient available water exists on nearby Federal lands to furnish 85,000 acre feet of water per annum to the reservation. Requires the Secretary, if he so finds, to enter into an agreement with the commuity to furnish such water, not later than four years after the date of the agreement. Authorizes the Secretary to receive and consider any claims of water users other than the Ak-Chin Indian community for any losses incurred by the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary, within 25 years of the date of enactment of this Act, as part of the agreement with the community, to provide for the permanent delivery, on an annual basis, to the Ak-Chin Indian Reservation, of 85,000 acre feet of water suitable for irrigation. Stipulates that, as consideration for such agreement, the Ak-Chin Indian Community shall waive any claim it might have against the United States, Arizona, or any other person, corporation or municipal corporation. Authorizes to be appropriated for fiscal year 1979, $500,000, and the aggregate sum of $42,500,000 to be appropriated prior to fiscal year 1983 to carry out certain provisions of this Act."
