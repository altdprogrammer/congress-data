    "text": "Contract Disputes Reform Act - Authorizes an executive agency to settle any claim arising out of any express or implied contract of such agency. Requires an agency contracting officer to settle disputes which cannot be resolved by mutual agreement. Permits any contractor to request an informal administrative conference with the appropriate agency to review the decision of the contracting officer. Declares the decision of the contracting officer to be final unless the contractor sues or appeals as provided in this Act. Permits each agency to establish an agency Board of Contract Appeals if the volume of procurement of such agency justifies a Board of at least three full-time members. Requires appeals to be made to such Board within 90 days of receipt of the contracting officer's decision. Provides for an appeal to the Board of another agency in the event that the party agency does not have its own Board. Requires the rules of each board to provide for a simplified procedure for small claims of $25,000 or less which can be invoked at the option of the contractor. Permits suits in any U.S. district court or the Court of Claims in lieu of an appeal by the contractor to an agency Board. Permits the agency or the contractor to appeal any decision of an agency Board to such Courts. States that in the event the agency appeals a Board decision, that decision shall not be overturned unless arbitrary, capricious, or so clearly erroneous as to imply bad faith. (Amends 28 U.S.C. 2401; 2517)"
