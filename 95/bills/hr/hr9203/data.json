    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 95-814) National Crude Oil Supply and Transportation Act - Expresses the intent of Congress that the continuation of a transportation system to deliver Alaskan crude oil to Northern Tier and inland States be accomplished through expedited administrative procedures. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to any applicant who has applied for approval under this Act, to consult with any Federal agency which must issue permits or other authorizations for any crude oil transportation system. Requires the Secretary to provide appropriate means by which the Governor of any State and any other interested person may submit such views and written comments as they shall determine to be appropriate. Directs the Secretary to determine, within 45 days after completion of any required Federal environmental impact statement, which, if any, crude oil transportation systems will be approved under this Act. Requires that a decision on the Long Beach-Midland project be made as soon as practicable. Requires that the Federal environmental impact statement be completed no later than December 15, 1978. Establishes criteria to be considered by the Secretary in selecting a transportation route. Directs the Secretary and other appropriate Federal officials to take all actions necessary to provide rights of way, permits, leases, and other authorizations necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the transportation system approved under this Act. States that rights-of-way over Federal land shall be governed according to the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Directs the President to enter into further negotiations with the Government of Canada with respect to the United States-Canada Transit Pipeline Agreement, and the possibility of United States-Canadian crude oil exchange. Stipulates that actions seeking judicial review of a Federal decision relating to the approval or the permitting of a crude oil transportation system are required to be brought in a United States district court within 60 days following the date of such decision. Declares that nothing in this Act shall authorize or imply an exemption from provisions of the antitrust laws. Authorizes to be appropriated beginning fiscal year 1979 and each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as are necessary by the Secretary in carrying out this Act."
