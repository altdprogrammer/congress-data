    "text": "Middle-Aged and Older Workers Employment Act - Title I: Statement of Findings and Declaration of Purpose - Declares it the purpose of this Act to establish and stimulate programs which will afford older workers a range of real and reasonable employment alternatives and to eliminate arbitrary discriminatory practices which deny work to qualified persons solely on the basis of age. Title II: Midcareer Development Service and Special Programs in the Department of Labor for Middle-Aged and Older Persons - Establishes within the Department of Labor a Midcareer Development Service, through which the Secretary of Labor is authorized to make loans and grants for training designed to upgrade the work skills of middle-aged persons who are at least 40 years of age. Empowers the Secretary to develop a program to qualify individuals to train and retrain older workers in skills needed in the economy. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a special unit to be made available upon request, to localities where a substantial number of people are unemployed as a result of a mass layoff, such unit to provide recruitment, placement, and counseling services. Directs the Secretary, through the Midcareer Development Service, to implement counseling services with respect to employment and training opportunities for unemployed persons at least 40 years of age. Directs the Secretary to conduct a thorough study of federally assisted manpower training programs to determine whether such programs are responsive to the needs of persons 40 years of age and older. Title III: Work Opportunities and Community Service Programs - Establishes a program for job opportunities for older Americans with Federal contractors. Authorizes the Secretary to make special provisions for the registration, counseling selection, and referral for part-time or temporary employment of older workers. Authorizes the Secretary to promote useful part-time work opportunities in community services for retired and aged workers. Empowers the Secretary to enter into agreements providing for Federal payment of up to 90 percent of the cost of State or local community service programs if it is determined that, among other considerations, services in the program will be provided only by individuals who are at least 55 years of age. Title IV: Expanding Opportunities for Employment, Education, and Retirement - Authorizes the Secretary to conduct research and other specified activities for the purpose of the provisions of this Act. Empowers the President to appoint a Commission of Lifelong Adult Education to study specified areas related to the employment of middle-aged and older workers, such Commission to report its findings and recommendations to the President and Congress. Directs the Secretary of Labor to study the advisability of establishing a program of transitional allowances for unemployed workers between age 55 and 65 who have inadequate financial resources. Title V: General - Sets forth guidelines for the administration of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to employ experts and consultants as necessary and to appoint without regard to civil service laws, advisory committees composed of private citizens and Federal, State, and local government officials to advise him with respect to his functions under this Act. Title VI: Federal Employment Opportunities for Middle-Aged and Older Workers - Directs the Civil Service Commission to undertake a study of part-time employment in the executive branch of the United States Government, and to report its findings to Congress. Directs the Commission to undertake a study of the feasibility of redesigning positions in the executive branch to increase the number of positions available to older individuals. Directs the Commission to undertake special work and training programs to provide low income, unemployed middle-aged persons with job opportunities in the executive branch. Title VII: Sex Discrimination - Prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex against any individual under any program or activity under this Act."
