Directs that a convicted person who has filed an appeal be detained unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact. Applies with specified exceptions, procedures for appealing conditions of release to appeals of detention orders. Sets forth sanctions for violating release conditions, threatening witnesses or jurors while on release, and committing serious offenses while on release."
