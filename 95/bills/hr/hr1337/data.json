    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that the constructive retail sales prices for computing the manufacturers excise tax on heavy bus, trucks, and bus and truck bodies and chassis shall be based on the highest price such articles are normally sold for by manufacturers and producers. Allows any adult (formerly only heads of families) to produce wine and beer for personal and family use and not for sale without incurring the wine or beer excise taxes or any penalties for quantities per calendar year of: (1) 200 gallons if there are two or more adults in the household and (2) 100 gallons if there is only one adult in the household. Entitles aerial applicators who use tax-paid fuel for farming purposes to refunds of gasoline or special fuels taxes in place of any farmer who waives the right to such refunds. Permits an employee in a qualified trust to transfer all or part of the total taxable amount of a termination or discontinuance distribution or a lump sum distribution to an eligible rollover source without such amount being included in gross income. Defines \"eligible rollover source\" as: (1) an individual retirement account; (2) an individual retirement annuity; (3) a retirement bond; (4) a qualified trust; or (5) an annuity plan. Permits special \"makeup\" rollovers for certain individuals who failed in their attempts to comply with the previous requirement that all property received in such distributions be transferred. Amends the Social Security Act to permit the State of California to continue cash payments to supplemental security income recipients in lieu of food stamps."
