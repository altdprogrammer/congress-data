    "text": "Youth Camp Safety Act - Establishes in the Office of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare an Office of Youth Camp Safety to be headed by a Director of Youth Camp Safety. Confers upon the Director the primary responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of Federal and State youth camp safety regulations. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and modification of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Director for his approval. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in the United States Court of Appeals. Authorizes the Director to make grants to States which have in effect approved State plans, such grants not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of carrying out the State plan. Authorizes the Director to enter and inspect youth camps and their records. Charges the Director with establishing within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety and to submit to Congress at least once a year a report on his administration under this Act. Prescribes penalties for each violation by youth camp operators of the standards promulgated pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Director to request and receive directly from any department or agency of the Federal Government information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics needed to carry out the functions under this Act."
