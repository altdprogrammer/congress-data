Authorizes State Governors' or governing bodies of Indian tribes to designate energy impact areas in accordance with specified conditions. Requires such parties to establish energy impact assessment teams: (1) to assess the effects of energy development on designated areas relating to the needs of such areas for additional public facilities or services; and (2) to report on such assessment in a mitigation plan for responding to such needs. Requires the President to issue an Executive Order providing for coordination by the Secretary of Commerce of all Federal programs which may provide assistance or meet the needs identified in an area's mitigation plan. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants or provide other financial and technical assistance to assessment teams to assist them in carrying out their duties and to States and Indian tribes for the purpose of carrying out mitigation plans. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, loans, loan guarantees and payments of interest cost to State or local governments or Indian tribes to meet emergency needs for public facilities or services in a designated energy impact area. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans made to assist such parties in carrying out mitigation plans. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
