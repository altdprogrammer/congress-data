    "text": "Consumer Product Water Efficiency Act - Prohibits any person from distributing in commerce any covered product unless it meets either the improvement targets or final water efficiency standards established by the Federal Trade Commission in accordance with this Act. Includes under the requirements of this Act any product which is partially or wholly dependent on the consumption or flow of water for its operation or which is designed to consume or to depend wholly or in part on the consumption or flow of water, and which is distributed in commerce to a significant extent, for personal use or consumption by an individual. Includes household appliances, bathroom fixtures, water softeners and water recirculation system within the meaning of the term \"covered product. Prohibits the distribution in interstate commerce of covered products unless the product bears a label stating ratio of water consumed by the product to the amount of water to be consumed by the product upon achievement of the final water efficiency standards. Directs the Commission to prescribe water efficiency improvement targets for each type of covered product. Authorizes the Commission, upon the introduction of any new product, to set water efficiency improvement targets, which shall become the minimum mandatory water efficiency standard for such product. Requires the Commission to direct the National Bureau of Standards to develop tests to determine: (1) the actual water efficiency level of the covered product; (2) reasonable water efficiency improvement targets for each covered product; and (3) minimum mandatory water efficiency standards for each covered product. Requires manufacturers of covered products for which any regulation is prescribed to: (1) notify the Commission of any model manufactured to which such regulation applies; (2) conduct any test required in the regulation; (3) provide a label which meets the prescribed regulations; and (4) supply a reasonable number of such covered products to the Commission for testing. Stipulates that any covered product which is offered for importation into the customs territory of the United States and which does not comply with the requirements of this Act shall be refused admission. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the importation of any covered product under terms and conditions set by the Secretary. Imposes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Prescribes procedures for civil actions against manufacturers, distributors, or retailers alleged to be in violation of this Act and against Federal agencies which have allegedly failed to perform nondiscretionary duties under this Act. Makes it an unfair or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act to violate the distribution provisions of this Act. Defines the terms used in this Act."
