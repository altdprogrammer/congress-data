    "text": "Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments - Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, where lands selected and conveyed to a Village Corporation are insufficient to fulfill the Corporation's entitlement, to withdraw twice the amount of unfulfilled entitlement and provide the Village Corporation 90 days to select from the lands withdrawn the land it desires to fulfill its entitlement. Sets forth provisions concerning retained mineral estates and subsurface estates. Withdraws from further entry all lands located in patented townsites which are the subject of an application for patent under specified Acts. Directs the townsite trustee to convey all unoccupied lands and any remaining unobligated trust funds to the home rule or first or second class city organized for the townsite community, or, in the absence of a city, to the State of Alaska in trust. Prohibits judicial review of a decision of the Secretary under this Act unless such action is initiated within one year of such decision. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out certain provisions of the Settlement Act pertaining to the payment into escrow of certain funds received on lands withdrawn for native selection. Authorizes the Secretary to waive, in certain instances, the whole section selection requirement."
