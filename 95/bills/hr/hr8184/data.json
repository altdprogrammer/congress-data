    "text": "Voluntary Standards and Accreditation Act - Title I: National Standardization - Requires the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate rules relating to the procedures and practices of standards-development organizations, testing laboratories, and certification agencies, and the use of product listings and certificates of approval in marketing. Requires the Commission, when promulgating rules under this title, to give all interested persons an opportunity for oral presentations of data, views, and arguments, and a single opportunity to present rebuttal testimony in writing. Permits the Commission to exempt the activities of a standards-development organization, testing laboratory, or certification agency from the requirements of the newly promulgated rules. Permits the Commission to enforce the procedures set forth pursuant to this Act upon its own initiative or upon a written petition filed with it by any interested person. States that any violation of this title or failure to comply with any Commission rule promulgated under this title shall be prosecuted as an unfair trade practice pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. Directs the Commission to notify by publication in the Federal Register, the Secretary of Commerce and all Federal departments and agencies which use the publications of a standards-development organization, of any violation of this title by such an organization or by a certification agency. Directs a department or agency notified by the Commission that an organization is in violation of this title to cease using the services of such organization unless such organization complies within a period determined by the Commission. Subjects to the provisions of this Act any private organization that: (1) develops standards; (2) sponsors the activity of developing or adopting standards; (3) tests, inspects, or certifies products; or (4) sells or uses standards, product listings, or certificates of approval. Directs the Commission to specifically advise an organization that voluntarily submitted its rules for review and does not comply with the new rules, on the procedure such organization may undertake to come into compliance. Authorizes the Secretary to grant financial assistance to nonprofit standards-development organizations to insure representation of consumer, small business, and other interests in decisions. Requires all Federal agencies to utilize standards set by certified private agencies whenever possible in order to avoid duplication of effort. Directs all standards-development organizations, testing laboratories, and certification agencies subject to regulation by the Commission to establish appeals bodies to consider complaints filed by interested persons. States that such appeals bodies shall have no powers of enforcement except those given to them by the organizations' creating such bodies. Title II: International Standardization - Establishes an Institute of Standards and Accreditation within the National Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce to develop the resources, facilities, and expertise necessary to assist the Secretary and the Commission in the exercise of their responsibilities under this Act. Requires the Secretary, through the Institute, to provide for and assist appropriate participation by private nonprofit organizations in international standardization activities as representatives of the United States. Requires the Secretary to make arrangements for direct governmental participation in such international standardization activities where the Secretary determines private participation is insufficient or cannot be established. Directs the Secretary to list each international standards and certification agreement developed pursuant to this title unless to do so would not be in the public interest. Establishes an interagency committee on international standardization policy and a public committee on international standardization policy to provide policy guidance to the Secretary in carrying out his duties under this title. Establishes procedures for petitioning the Secretary to delist a particular international standard or certification and for judicial review of the Secretary's determinations. Title III: Testing Laboratory Accreditation - Requires the Secretary, through the Institute, to set forth procedures to establish a voluntary national laboratory accreditation program to accredit certification laboratories for a class of technology or a specific product if the establishment of such laboratory is found to be in the public interest. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria committees to establish criteria to accredit such laboratories. Sets forth procedures for the development of such criteria and the accreditation of such laboratories. Establishes procedures for the removal, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation. Title IV: National Standards Management Board - Establishes as an independent instrumentality in the executive branch, a National Standards Management Board to develop the necessary rules, procedures, policies, and criteria to manage and coordinate national standards-development activities. Directs the Board to develop rules and policies to be used by the Institute when accrediting standards-development organizations and approving national standards. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to appoint a Director of the Institute of Standards and Accreditation to supervise the Institute, its equipment, and its functions."
