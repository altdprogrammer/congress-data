Sets forth the duties of owners of containers, concerning approval and examination of containers. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations regarding: (1) procedures for the testing, inspection, and initial approval of existing and new containers and of designs for new containers, including procedures relating to the affixing, invalidating, and removal of safety approval plates for containers; (2) procedures to be followed by owners of containers relating to the periodic examination of containers, as provided in the Convention; and (3) a method for developing, collecting, and disseminating data concerning container safety and the international transport of containers. Allows the Secretary to: (1) authorize the affixation of a safety approval plate to any container which, after examination, is not found to have a safety approval plate attached to it and which the owner has established meets the standards of the Convention; (2) delegate and withdraw the delegation of authority to initially approve existing and new containers and designs for new containers, and to authorize the affixing of a safety approval plate; and (3) establish a schedule of fees to be charged and collected for services related to the testing inspection, end initial approval of containers and container designs. Permits the Secretary to take action to ensure compliance with the Act. Provides that, beginning on the fifth anniversary of the date the convention enters into force for the United States, the Secretary may examine or require to be examined any existing container in international transport. Authorizes the Secretary to issue detention or other necessary orders for containers not having valid safety approval plates. Establishes civil penalties for moving containers in violation of a detention order. Prohibits discrimination against employees who have reported the existence of an unsafe container or who have reported violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Transportation, to propose amendments to the Convention or to request a conference to amend the Convention. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
