    "text": "Labor Intensive Public Works Act - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 by adding a new title, \"Labor Intensive Public Works.\" Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, through the Economic Development Administration, to make grants to States and units of local government for the purpose of public works projects on public buildings, including construction, renovation, demolition and energy conservation. Requires at least 50 percent, but not more than 80 percent, of the total costs of each project to be spent on labor, and further requires that at least 50 percent of the persons employed on a project be long-term unemployed as defined in this Act. Directs that grant monies be allocated among the States on the basis of relative unemployment, but provides a set aside for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. Sets forth a number of requirements that recipients of grants must adhere to, including making affirmative efforts to recruit apprentices, youths and members of minority groups for employment on projects funded under this Act."
