    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-06-16", 
    "text": "Exempts courses which lead to a standard college degree from the \"85-15\" rule whereby the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs is required to disapprove enrollment of any eligible veteran, not already enrolled, in any course offered by an educational institution where more than 85 percent of the students enrolled have their fees paid by either the Veterans' Administration or the institution itself. Limits application of the \"85-15\" rule to proprietary (that is, private) profit or proprietary nonprofit educational institutions. Grants the Administrator discretion to permit a veteran or an eligible person to continue a course of training, without mitigating circumstances for a reasonable length of time beyond the approved length for the course before progress will be considered unsatisfactory. Consolidates existing provisions of title 38 United States Code relating to the certification of courses required before educational assistance allowances will be paid to otherwise eligible veterans or eligible persons. Exempts from the required two-year minimum of operation prior to approval: (1) any course which is available only to active duty military personnel, civilian employees of the military departments, and dependents of such personnel and employees; (2) any course meeting general criteria of past compliance with regulations, specified academic standards, a 50-percent placement rate (if vocational), and recommendation by the appropriate State approving agency, if the Administrator determines such course should be approved; and (3) any course offered by a branch or extension of an approved institution if the course is identical to a course offered at the main campus of the institution. Prohibits, as of December 1, 1976, the execution of a power of attorney, by an educational assistance allowance payee, giving an attorney-in-fact authority to negotiate a benefit check."
