    "text": "Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to include within the definition of employer State and local governments, thereby subjecting them to the requirements imposed on employers by such Act. Increases the number of members of the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health from 12 to 14 and requires one member of such committee be a representative of State and local government employees. Permits the Secretary of Labor to make an inspection of a State and local government employer upon receiving notice from the employees of such employer if he determines that reasonable grounds exist to believe that a pattern or practice of violations or dangers exists. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing citations with respect to violations by a State or local government employer. Establishes special enforcement procedures to be utilized against a State or local government employer. Empowers the United States district courts to restrain pattern or practice violations by such employer and to issue any order as may be necessary to avoid, correct, or remove such violation. Requires the Secretary to first attempt to achieve voluntary compliance through informal conciliation before filing a petition in district court. Exempts State and local government employers from civil and criminal penalties imposed under this Act."
