    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #491 (204-89)) Amtrak Improvement Act - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize appropriations for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation for fiscal year 1979. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation with the Corporation to develop a preliminary recommendation for a route system for the Corporation which will provide an optimal intercity railroad passenger system based on current and future market and population requirements. Specifies considerations which the Secretary is to consider in formulating such recommendations and specifies provisions to be included in such report. Directs the Rail Services Planning Office to conduct public hearings on the Secretary's recommendations and to submit its findings to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to thoroughly consider such material in developing a final recommended route system for the Corporation. Directs the Secretary to submit final recommendations for such basic system to both Houses of Congress and specified congressional committees. Stipulates that such final recommendations shall be deemed approved only by the adoption by both Houses of a resolution approving such recommendations. Directs the Corporation after such approval to complete the implementation of the basic route system as soon as possible. Requires the Planning Office, in the course of the hearings, to conduct an evaluation of alternatives to the existing organizational structure of the Corporation and of the relationship of the Corporation to the Federal Government. Requires the Comptroller General to study the economic relationship of the fare structure of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to the intercity bus industry. Gives the Interstate Commerce Commission, upon the application of any aggrieved motor carrier, jurisdiction over any rate, fare, charge or marketing practice of the Corporation respecting any route or service operating at a loss for the purpose of hearing the complaint over an unfair or predatory practice. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to establish maximum travel times between points in the Northeast Corridor. Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to develop economical and reliable rolling stock and related equipment designed to be compatible with the track, and operating and marketing characteristics of the Northeast Corridor. Sets aside $27,000,000 from the sums authorized to be appropriated for the Northeast Corridor to finance the cost of equipment modification and replacement which States will be required to bear as a result of the electrification conversion system of the Northeast Corridor. Requires the Corporation to purchase only unmanufactured articles, materials, supplies which have been: (1) mined or produced in the United States; and (2) manufactured in the United States substantially from materials from the United States. Sets forth specified exceptions to such requirements. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to evaluate the common stock ownership of the Corporation and to submit a report to Congress setting forth recommendations with respect to retention, retirement, or conversion of such common stock. Requires the Corporation to develop and implement a Rail Safety System Program for employees working on property owned by the Corporation. Provides that the Federal share of projects for the conversion of intercity passenger train terminals into intermodal passenger terminals, or community and cultural centers, shall be increased from 60 to 80 percent. Authorizes the Corporation to operate commuter rail passenger service under an agreement with a State if such State agrees to reimburse the Corporation for the avoidable cost of operating such commuter rail passenger service. Directs the Corporation to utilize all feasible means to attract and service the bulk mail needs of the Postal Service."
