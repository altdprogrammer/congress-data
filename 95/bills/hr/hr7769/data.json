Disqualifies from the provisions of this Act those persons who ordered, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, or political opinion. Admits individuals under this Act without regard to immigration quotas. =Title II: Extension of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975= - Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for carrying out the domestic assistance provisions of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, with respect to refugees from Cambodia, Vietnam, or Laos. Permits funds appropriated under the Act to be used to reimburse State or local public agencies for the non-Federal share of costs for those needy refugees who qualify under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children or Medicaid programs of the Social Security Act. Establishes September 30, 1981, as the termination date of the Act. Provides for the following percentages of Federal assistance for refugee cash assistance, medical assistance, social services, and State-local costs: (1) fiscal year 1978, 100 percent; (2) fiscal year 1979, 75 percent of the 1978 cost; (3) fiscal year 1980, 50 percent of such cost; and (4) fiscal year 1981, 25 percent of such cost. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 to assist refugees in resettling and in gaining skills and education necessary to become self-reliant."
