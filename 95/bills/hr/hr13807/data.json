Authorizes the President to exempt Federal agencies from the requirement of the Act that agencies take no action which would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species if he finds that the agency action is of national or regional significance and the national interest warrants an exemption. Exempts certain raptors legally held in captivity on the effective date of this Act from certain restrictions of the Act relating to possession and dealing in endangered species. Exempts certain antique articles made from an endangered species from the import restrictions of the Act."
