Provides, through the Secretary, loans for technical assistance and status and operating costs to an employee or employee/community corporation which meets certain requirements in order that it may assume ownership and operation of an organization so identified. Conditions loans, among other factors, upon certification that the corporation will allow new employees to participate and will adopt a method for acquisition of stock of persons no longer associated with the organization for the purpose of making it available to all employees on a nondiscriminatory basis. Authorizes loans of up to $15,000 to an employee who wishes to purchase stock in a purchasing corporation and who is unable to secure financing elsewhere."
