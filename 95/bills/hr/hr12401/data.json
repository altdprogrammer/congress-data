Requires to be included on the National Council of Health Planning and Development not fewer than seven persons who are not providers of health services including individuals who are members of urban and rural medically underserved populations. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to health systems agencies on the basis of square mileage served by the agency, for the development and operation of subarea councils and requires health systems agencies to consider the views of such councils. Changes the formula by which the size of grants to health systems agencies shall be determined. Requires that members of the Statewide Health Coordinating Council who are consumers of health or mental health care and who are not providers of health or mental health care must include individuals who are members of rural and urban underserved populations, if such populations exist in the State."
