    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1545) International Development and Food Assistance Act - =Title I: Development Assistance= - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to declare that a principal objective of U.S. Foreign Policy is the encouragement and sustained support of the development efforts of people in developing countries. States that U.S. development policy should emphasize four principal goals: (1) alleviation of poverty; (2) promotion of self-sustaining growth; (3) encouragement of societies in which individual civil and economic rights are respected; and (4) integration of developing countries into an open international economic system. Stipulates that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in U.S. Foreign Policy. Sets forth a development assistance policy which recognizes that developing countries have a long-term need for external assistance. Directs that provision of development resources: (1) be adapted to the needs and capabilities of specific developing countries; (2) that for those countries with low per capita incomes and limited access to private external capital, assistance be made on congressional terms; and (3) that for other developing countries, assistance consist of programs which facilitate access to private capital markets, investment, and technical skills. Requires bilateral development assistance authorized by this Act: (1) to be used in support of the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs and to be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves and; (2) to be administered in a collaborative style to support the development goals chosen by each country receiving assistance, while helping such governments to enhance their planning, technical, and administrative capabilities needed to insure the success of such undertakings. Specifies that United States cooperation in development should be carried out through the private sector, including those institutions which already have ties in the developing areas, such as educational institutions, cooperatives, credit unions, free labor unions, private and voluntary agencies, and through private investment. Enumerates additional principles which shall be followed to carry out the strategy for bilateral development assistance to help countries solve development problems set forth in this Act, including the concentration on projects which do not involve large-scale capital transfers. Repeals certain conditions pertaining to development loans and provides that the President shall determine the terms and conditions of, and the interest payable on, development loans. Requires the President to consider the economic circumstances of the borrowing country and other relevant factors. Limits to $10,000,000 each fiscal year the amount of funds which may be made available to research and educational institutions in the United States for the purpose of strengthening their capacity to develop and carry out programs concerned with the economic and social development of developing countries. States as a Congressional finding that participation of the rural and urban poor in their countries' development can be facilitated through increased activities by private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives. Encourages a greater utilization of such organizations in planning projects and in carrying out and development activities using U.S. funds. Revises provisions of such Act authorizing use of development assistance funds to pay transportation charges from U.S. ports to foreign countries of relief and rehabilitation shipments made by the American National Red Cross and by certain U.S. voluntary nonprofit relief agencies. Repeals the provision of such Act which prohibits, without express congressional approval, the use of both development and economic support funds (ESF) in the same country in the same fiscal year. Repeals other development assistance provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to: (1) the Development Loan Fund (except for regional development in Africa and multilateral and regional programs); (2) the technical cooperation and development grants (except for American schools and hospitals abroad and a prototype desalting plant in Israel); (3) technical cooperation and development grants; (4) loans to small farmers; (5) programs for peaceful communication; (6) assistance in reopening the Suez Canal; (7) assistance for the Alliance of Progress; and (8) Southeast Asia Multilateral and Regional Programs. Makes certain technical amendments to reflect such repeals. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish assistance for agricultural, rural development, and nutrition. Authorizes the appropriation of $665,231,000 for fiscal year 1979 to alleviate starvation, hunger and malnutrition and to provide basic services to poor people by increasing their capacity for self-help. States that where the development of major infrastructures are necessary, such as farm-to-market roads and water management systems, assistance should be furnished in association with other countries working together in a multilateral framework. Specifies that such infrastructure projects should be complemented by other measures to insure that the benefits of the infrastructure projects reach the poor. Directs increased emphasis on rural development and expanded food production in the poorest nations as a matter of social justice and a principal element contributing to broadly based economic growth, as well as an important factor in alleviating inflation in the industrialized countries. Requires that, in allocating agriculture and rural development funds, special attention be given to increasing agricultural production in countries which have been designated as least developed by the United Nations General Assembly. Encourages increased production of crops with greater nutritional value. Redefines certain terms regarding agricultural assistance to include aquaculture and fishery, throughout such Act. Amends the Congressional policy statement of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to population and health assistance. Authorizes the President to furnish assistance for voluntary population planning to increase the opportunities and motivation to reduce the rate of population growth and for health programs to improve the health of the greatest number of poor people in developing countries. Calls for the integration of such assistance programs. Requires health research under this Act to: (1) be undertaken to the maximum extent practicable in developing countries by such countries' personnel; (2) recognize the special needs of the poor in determination of research priorities; and (3) make use of field testing.
