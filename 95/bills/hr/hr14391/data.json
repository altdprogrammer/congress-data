    "text": "Establishes the Saint Charles Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana. Directs the Secretary of the Interior: (1) to acquire land within the boundaries of the 24,000 acres selected as appropriate for the purposes of a national wildlife refuge, by donation, purchase, or exchange; and (2) to administer the land in accordance with the National Wildlife System Administration Act of 1966, and under any other authority available to him for conservation and environmental protection purposes. Directs the Secretary to construct and administer a wildlife interpretation and education center at an appropriate site within or near the refuge. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan for the conservation and protection of the refuge by the Secretary or appropriate State authorities, including provisions for granting rights-of-way for runways and runway approaches in the event of expansion of the New Orleans International Airport and for construction of Federal aid highway I-310. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to acquire rights-of-way for the construction of a levee outside the boundary of the refuge; (2) to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Chief of Engineers for the management of wildlife within the Bonnet Carre Floodway. Exempts the Department of Transportation from the environmental analysis required by the Department of Transportation Act and from the findings relating to environmental protection of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 with respect to the development of New Orleans International Airport. Exempts the construction of Federal aid highway I-310 from the park preservation requirements of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1966, as amended, for that portion of the highway which may pass thru the refuge. Authorizes the appropriation of up to $20,000,000 for the acquisition of land for the refuge and up to $7,000,000 for the development of the refuge."
