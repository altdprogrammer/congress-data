Designates such a payment a nutritional supplement. Prohibits the issuance of a coupon allotment to a household for any month it receives such payments. Defines the \"bonus value of a coupon allotment\" as the difference in value between the face value of the coupon allotment and the charge to be paid by the household for such allotment."
