Rept. 95-371) Agricultural Census Amendments Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to reduce the overall burden on respondents in the 1979 census of agriculture, drainage and irrigation to no more than 60 percent of the burden on respondents in the 1974 census. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the subjects to be covered on the Agricultural Census (three years prior to the commencement of the census) and on the questions included on such census (two years prior to the commencement of the census). Requires the statistical definition of farms in the 1979 census not to exclude any establishment which would normally sell more than $600 worth of agricultural products during the census year; or, for census years following 1979, $600 worth, adjusted by a specified percentage. Directs the Department of Commerce to improve the collection, analysis and publication of data about the ownership structure of American farms. Requires publication of information obtained in each such census as soon as practicable, but in no event later than March 1 of the year following the year in which such census is taken."
