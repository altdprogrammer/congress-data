    "date": "1977-05-11", 
    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to allow the granting of variances from clean air standards to powerplants which emit sulfur dioxide. Requires that such variances be granted where (1) the unemployment rate in the affected State exceeds four percent and where (2) the variances does not allow for continuous sulfur dioxide emissions which may pose a serious threat to public health. Requires that variances issued under this Act set forth compliance schedules which require increments of progress in emission control technology. Stipulates that variances shall not exceed a five-year period. Authorizes additional variances for periods of up to five years if the unemployment rate in the affected State exceeds four percent. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to impose interim requirements where technologically and economically practicable beyond a reasonable doubt. Authorizes enforcement proceedings, and or revocation of variances for violation of any such conditions."
