    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) Extends until October 1, 1978 certain provisions relating to the social services program of the Social Security Act including: (1) additional child care funding; (2) use of added-funding for employment of welfare recipients; (3) welfare recipients tax credit; (4) child care staffing standards; and (5) treatment of alcoholics and addicts. Extends to employees of State agencies who provide specialized services to schools, the provisions of law under which teachers must be denied unemployment compensation benefits during regular vacation periods. Revises the protective and vendor payment procedure under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Increases from 10 to 20 percent the limitation on such payments that can be made pursuant to a determination by a State agent that the relative or guardian is not able to manage funds in the best interests of a dependent child. Allows such vendor payments to be made in the form of two party checks. Extends, until July 1, 1978, the period for allowing depreciation for expenditures to rehabilitate low income rental housing. Extends, until January 1, 1979, the exclusion from income for amounts received under the Armed Forces Health Professional School Scholarship Program (and similar programs). Prevents disaster victims from having their Supplemental Security Income benefits reduced or terminated because they receive assistance to replace damaged property. Exempts employment agencies placing companion sitters from the Internal Revenue Code requirements imposed on employers with regard to social security and unemployment taxes. Reaffirms that States are required to continue to retain child support payment in excess of the regular monthly support order as reimbursement for past assistance payments."
