Stipulates that an offender must consent to any transfer and may only be transferred to a country of which is a citizen or national. Bars transfer of an offender while any appeal or collateral attack is pending. Conditions the transfer to the United States of an offender who is on probation upon a determination that by the Attorney General that the appropriate United States district court is willing to undertake the supervision of the offender. States that, with certain exceptions, an offender serving a sentence of imprisonment in a foreign country who is transferred to the custody of the Attorney General shall remain in custody for the same time, be entitled to the same good time privileges, and subject to the same conditions as an offender committed to the custody of the Attorney General by a Federal court. Provides that offenders transferred to the United States shall be eligible for parole according to Federal law. Makes eligible for parole at any time an offender transferred to the United States who was age 21 or younger when convicted. Directs that, unless otherwise provided by or pursuant to treaty, offenders transferred to the United States because of an act which would be deemed an act of juvenile delinquency in the United States be treated as a delinquent. Sets forth procedures for verification of consent of an offender transferred to or from the United States. Specifies guidelines on the status of alien offenders transferred to other countries. Restricts jurisdiction to challenge the conviction or sentence of a transferred offender to the country of conviction."
