    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-636) Amends the National Trails System Act of 1968 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Advisory Council for the Appalachian National Scenic Trail for a ten-year period. Provides that the Secretary shall consult with such Council with respect to matters relating to the Trail, including the selection of rights-of-way, standards for the erection and maintenance of markers along the Trail, and the administration of the Trail. Sets forth the method for selection of members of the Council and limits the term of members to two years. Requires the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan for the management, acquisition, development, and use of the Appalachian Trail, and to submit the plan to the appropriate committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives within two years of the date of enactment of this Act. Modifies the Secretary's authority concerning the use of eminent domain to provide that the Secretary may acquire in fee title and lesser interest no more than an average of 125 acres per mile. Authorizes the appropriation of $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1979, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, and $30,000,000, for fiscal year 1981, for the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Expresses the intent of the Congress that the Secretary should substantially complete the land acquisition program necessary to insure the protection of the Trail within three years of the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the progress of the acquisition program, until the program is completed. Directs the Appalachian Trail Conference to submit annual progress reports on the acquisition program to the appropriate committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives."
