Removes consideration of the salaries of the Vice President, Members of Congress and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico from the jurisdiction of the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries. States that the salaries of persons in positions subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission on the day before the enactment of this Act may not have their salaries raised after the enactment of this Act until the President determines that there are in effect codes of conduct applicable to all such persons which require financial disclosure, restrict income earned outside the Government, remove actual or potential conflicts of interest, and increase individual accountability for official expenses."
