    "text": "Endangered Species Act Amendments - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to revise the procedures followed by the Secretary of the Interior in issuing regulations under the Act. Authorizes the Endangered Species Committee, established by this Act, to exempt Federal agencies from the requirement of the Act that agencies take no action which would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species if the Commission finds that the agency action on any alternative measure cleary outweigh the benefits of the continued conservation of the species. Requires each Federal agency to utilize its resources to carry out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Establishes the Endangered Species Committee which shall be responsible for the review of applications for exemption from this Act. Sets forth the rules for granting such an exemption. Exempts certain antique articles made from an endangered species from the import restrictions of the Act."
