Stipulates that such compensation shall be equal to the fair market value of the damaged livestock or the medical expenses incurred to restore such livestock. Limits such compensation to damage occurring between October 1, 1977, and September 30, 1981. Sets forth the formula for determination of the Federal share of such compensation. Authorizes the appropriation of $600,000 to carry out such program. Directs the Secretary to study the type and extent of damage caused by such wolf and means of reducing or eliminating such damage."
