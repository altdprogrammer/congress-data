Drops the requirement that the home health care provided be of the same kind as provided in prior hospitalization. Eliminates the requirement that a physician review the home health care plan and that the patient be under the care of a physician. Requires that such functions be done by the appropriate health professional under regulation of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Extends Medicare coverage to include periodic chore services, hospital outreach services, nutritional counseling, health and supportive services furnished in elderly day care centers, and expansion of professional standard review organization review functions. Requires the Secretary to establish a review plan which is adapted to meet the non-institutional nature of home health services. Extends Medicare coverage only to those outpatient rehabilitation services which are certified by a physician as being required."
