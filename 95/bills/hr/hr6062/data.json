    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-04-05", 
    "text": "Experimental Sunset Act - Title I: Experimental Review of Selected Government Programs; Limitations on New Budget Authority - Requires each congressional committee having legislative jurisdiction over programs relating to active and retired military personnel or relating generally to education and training to conduct sunset review such as such term is defined in this Act, of such programs prior to September 30, 1979, to determine whether such programs merit continuation at present, lower, or higher levels or if they should be terminated. Prohibits the enactment of new budget authority for a program covered by this Act after such date unless a sunset review report has been submitted to the appropriate House by the committee having responsibility for such report. Exempts from this prohibition new budget authority necessary due to an emergency identified and explained by the appropriate committee. Requires the Comptroller General to provide the appropriate committees the results of prior audits and reviews of such programs. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 to require any Federal agency which administers any program which has been found to be deficient in achieving its objectives by the Comptroller General to inform Congress of the steps taken and the progress made toward eliminating such deficiency. Title II: Tax Expenditures - Requires the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate to conduct sunset reviews of each tax exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit, preferential tax rate, or deferral of tax liability prior to the date such provision is terminated pursuant to this Act and to conduct analogous reviews of all similar proposed tax provisions. Requires the Ninety-fifth Congress to become effective on December 31, of one of the years from 1979 through 1983. Requires termination dates for similar future tax provisions to be established so as to become effective after December 31, of one of the five years beginning with the first taxable year to which such provision applies. Forbids the consideration of any legislative which contains a tax provision covered by this Act unless a sunset review has been submitted to the appropriate House of Congress by the appropriate committee. Title III: Miscellaneous - Requires the head of each agency to transmit to Congress a statement of each request for new budget authority and a statement of estimated outlays which that agency has submitted to the President or the Office of Management and Budget."
