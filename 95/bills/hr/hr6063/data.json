Sets forth the requirements for obtaining such license. Establishes the royalty rates or payments for broadcast station based on gross receipts of advertising sponsors. Exempts certain broadcast stations and transmitters which publicly perform a copyrighted sound recording from liability for infringement and compulsory licensing requirements if the gross receipts of such stations are less than specified amounts.

Encourages the copyright owners, performers, and users affected by the procedure for collecting royalties established by this Act to established by this Act to establish a private, nongovernmental entity to assume the collection and distribution functions assigned to the Register of Copyrights."
