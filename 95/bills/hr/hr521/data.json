    "text": "Truth in Budgeting Act - Requires Congress, under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, to conduct a comprehensive review of all Federal programs every two years using zero-base budgeting concepts developed for such purpose by the Congressional Budget Office. Calls for the division of Federal programs into two groupings to enable Congress to review one-half of all Federal programs each year. Requires Congress to consider the past experience and expected future experience of such reviewed program. Directs the committee reviewing any such program to include in its report thereon an analysis of the service and costs of continuing such program (1) at less than existing levels, (2) at existing levels, (3) at a level projected to meet expected increases in work load at the functional level under the existing program, and (4) at a level which will allow expansion of existing activities. Prohibits the authorization of any appropriation for any program in excess of the appropriation made for such program for the preceding year unless that program has been subject to a review pursuant to this Act. States that this Act does not apply to those expenditures the Congressional Budget Office determines are uncontrollable under the Congressional Budget Act."
