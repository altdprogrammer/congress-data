    "date": "1977-03-03", 
    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a national television network from supplying a station licensee with more than one-half of the total hours of all programing broadcast by the licensee during any segment of the broadcast day. Allows a national television network to be the licensee of no more than one television broadcasting station. Gives any national television network which owns or has interest in more than one station a period of five years to divest itself of ownership of or interest in excess television broadcast stations. Directs each national television network of which owns or has interest in more than one station to file with the Federal Communications Commission, a plan of divestiture. Directs the Commission to grant an application for transfer or disposal of a station license pursuant to this Act, only upon a finding that the granting will not create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. Directs the Commission to conduct a continuing study of the effects of this Act and to submit an annual report of such study to the appropriate Congressional committees."
