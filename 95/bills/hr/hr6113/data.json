    "text": "Intergovernmental Coordination Act - Requires, under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968, any Federal agency which administers any program requiring a State plan as a condition of assistance to give the Governor of the State, or such agency as the Governor may designate, an opportunity to comment on the relationship of such State plan to any comprehensive or other State plan or program or to any plan or program of any affected areawide planning agency or unit of general local government. Directs such department or agency or unit of general local government be provided with an opportunity to review any State plan which has provided with an opportunity to review any State plan which has specific applicability to or effect upon areawide or local planning and programming or which establishes criteria or distribution formulas or systems for State subgrants of Federal assistance. Repeals title VIII of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 known as the Federal Urban Land-Use Act. Requires, whenever any Federal agency contemplates the disposal of any interest in real property, that reasonable notice be given to the Governor of the State in which such land is located and to the head of the governing body of the unit of general local government having jurisdiction over zoning and land-use regulation in the geographical area within which such land is located in order to afford the State and local government the opportunity of planning and zoning for the use of such land in accordance with State, areawide, and local comprehensive planning. Requires, to the extent practicable, prior to a commitment to acquire any real property or any interest in real property, any Federal agency or department to notify the State, the appropriate areawide agency and the local unit of general local government exercising zoning and land-use jurisdiction over the land proposed to be purchased of the intent of such agency or department to acquire such land and the proposed use of such land. Requires such acquiring agency to comply, to the extent practicable, with the zoning regulations and planning objectives of the State, areawide agency or local government with jurisdiction over such land. Permits any areawide agency which is designated under State laws or interlocal agreement to perform areawide comprehensive planning and has been designated as a planning and development clearinghouse to perform areawide planning under any Federal assistance program. Requires all such clearinghouses to prepare, adopt, and update annually a program for the coordinated use of Federal areawide planning assistance to develop and implement a unified and comprehensive areawide development plan. States that unless such program for the coordinated use of Federal areawide planning assistance has been adopted, no grant which assists areawide planning shall be made after two years from the date of enactment of this Act to any areawide planning agency under the authority of specified Federal assistance laws. Requires the concurrence of local governments within the jurisdiction of such development clearinghouse in such program. Requires such plan to be consistent with national urban growth and rural development policies. Provides that funds made available under any Federal assistance program for projects or activities undertaken by any areawide agency designated under State law or inter-local agreement to perform areawide comprehensive planning and to serve as a planning and development clearinghouse may be used jointly with funds made available for such projects or activities under any other Federal assistance program subject to regulations prescribed by the President."
