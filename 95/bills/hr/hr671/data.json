    "text": "Amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to require any individual using or carrying a firearm during the commission of a Federal crime which threatens life or property and is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year or any individual using or carrying a firearm, any part of which has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, during the commission of a State crime which threatens life or property and is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year shall, in addition to the punishment for such crime, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five years nor more than ten years. Permits the waiver of the additional sentence if the defendant (1) was under eighteen years of age; (2) was mentally impaired; (3) acting under substantial duress; or (4) was a minor participant in such crime. Prohibits the suspension of the additional penalty once imposed and the granting of probation. Requires that second or subsequent offenders be sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment of not less than ten years nor exceeding twenty five years. Prohibits the suspension of such additional sentence and the granting of probation for such additional sentence. Grants to State courts the power to impose these additional sentences. Directs the Attorney General of the United States to bring to the attention of the public the provisions of this Act."
