    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Ways and Means with amendment, H. Rept. 95-122) Reduces the withholding requirements enacted in the Tax Reform Act of 1976 to impose the 20 percent withholding tax on one-half of the proceeds from any single wager placed in a pari-mutuel pool with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai. Stipulates that there is to be no withholding unless the amount of such proceeds is at least $1,000 and is at least 300 times as large as the wager. Eliminates the reporting requirement for gambling winnings to which withholding applies and for all winnings from pari-mutuel pools with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai. Imposes withholding requirements on the net winnings of a State-conducted lottery if the proceeds are more than $5,000, regardless of whether the amount of the proceeds is determined by a pari-mutuel system. Eliminates reporting requirements for any gambling winnings to which withholding applies."
