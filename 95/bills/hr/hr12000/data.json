    "text": "Emergency Daylight Saving Time Act - Allows the President to declare an energy emergency exists within a State suffering from severe energy shortages. Requires, upon such declaration, that daylight savings time be instituted within the effected State for 60 days. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the President, within 60 days after the imposition or extension of emergency daylight saving time, concerning the operation and effect of this Act upon the effected State. Permits the President to declare additional 60-day emergency periods if he deems such action to be appropriate after having received the most recent report of the Secretary of Transportation. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to make appropriate adjustments in its rules where daytime standard amplitude modulation broadcast stations are adversely affected by the provisions of this Act."
