Directs the Secretary to refer to employers who request such certification, workers in the number desired, able and qualified, and who agree to present themselves to commence employment on the date and for the period specified. Authorizes the Attorney General, upon receipt of such certification by the Secretary, to extend the terms of an alien's admission for periods not exceeding one year in the aggregate."
