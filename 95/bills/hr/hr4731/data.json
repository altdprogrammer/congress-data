Makes provisions concerning the sharing of costs of construction and maintenance. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into cooperative agreements with such landowners for the purpose of controlling noxious weeds upon determining, among other things, that the proposed control project has the approval of the local weed control district and the Forest Service as effective and environmentally safe. Authorizes the following appropriations: (1) funds not to exceed $26,000,000 annually for the fencing program; and (2) funds not to exceed $5,000,000 annually for the noxious weed control program."
