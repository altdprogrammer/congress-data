Requires the Secretary to report to Congress, one year after enactment, about the actions he has taken to develop an acceptable nitrite substitute. Directs the Secretary to petition the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for the issuance of a regulation prescribing conditions for the safe use of any such nitrite substitute. Authorizes the Secretary to reallocate funds appropriated for the Department of Agriculture for other agricultural research programs to conduct the research required by this Act. Requires the Secretary, within 30 days after enactment, to report to Congress on the funds he plans to commit to nitrite substitute research, on the sources of such funds, and any recommendations about the funding necessary to fully effect such research."
