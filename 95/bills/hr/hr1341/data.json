Sets forth limitations on the total amount of such payments based on population and the amount of payments made under previously existing laws. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments for lands acquired by the United States for the National Wildlife Refuge Systems after a specified date. States that such payments shall be made to the county or other governmental unit which acts as the collecting and distributing agency for real property taxes in the area in which such lands lie. Stipulates that the amount of such payments shall be a percentage of the fair market value of the lands acquired. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Act."
