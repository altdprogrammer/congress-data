Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to assist schools of medicine in the establishment and operation of continuing education programs in geriatrics for physicians. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,500,000 for fiscal year 1978, and $5,000,000 for each of the next three fiscal years to enable the Secretary to make grants to schools of medicine to assist in developing and conducting training programs designed to prepare armed forces veterans, with appropriate experience as paramedical personnel, to serve as medical assistants in long-term health care facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts with public or nonprofit colleges and universities for the development of graduate programs for nurses in geriatrics and gerontology. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to make it an unfair labor practice for an employer to discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee who has testified before any congressional committee or any governmental agency or department."
