Directs the Administrator to promote the use of life cycle cost effective methods in all buildings. Directs the Administrator to establish energy performance targets for existing buildings which are compatible with new buildings which are compatible with new building performance standards developed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Requires all Federal agencies to conduct an energy audit of existing buildings within their jurisdiction. Requires that a specified percentage of the gross square footage of building space be selected by each agency for retrofitting with appropriate energy conservation measures."
