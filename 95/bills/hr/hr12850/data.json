    "text": "Water-Recreation Act - Amends the Federal Water Project Recreation Act to substitute the term \"water resources development project\" for the term \"reservoir\" in that portion of the Act which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire or make available adjacent lands to such project for public outdoor recreation fish and wildlife enhancement. Deletes the limitation providing that not more than $100,000 shall be available for such acquisitions at any one location. Provides that where no non-Federal public body has executed an agreement pursuant to this Act, which agreement provides that the non-Federal public body will administer such project land, then the Secretary is authorized to provide for public outdoor recreation facilities and fish and wildlife enhancement and to acquire such lands as necessary for public outdoor recreation in a manner coordinated with other project purposes."
