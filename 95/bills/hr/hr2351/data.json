    "date": "1977-01-24", 
    "text": "Clothing Stamp Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to formulate and administer a clothing stamp program under which, at the request of the State agency designated by the Secretary to carry out this Act in a State, eligible households within the State shall be provided with an opportunity to obtain an adequate supply of clothing through the issuance to such households of a coupon allotment which shall have a greater monetary value than the charge to be paid for such allotment by such households. Requires such coupons to be used only to purchase clothing from retail clothing stores approved for participation in the clothing stamp program. Requires the Secretary to establish uniform national standards of eligibility for participation by households in the clothing stamp program. Provides that participation in the program shall be limited to those households whose income and other financial resources are determined to be substantial limiting factors in permitting them to purchase an adequate supply of clothing. Establishes procedures for approval of retail clothing stores and wholesale clothing concerns which desire to be authorized to accept and redeem coupons under the clothing stamp program. Provides that any such approval may be withdrawn on a finding that such store or concern has violated any of the provisions of this Act. Establishes administrative and judicial review procedures for rejection of applications of disqualification of clothing concerns. Authorizes the Secretary to pay to each State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of all administrative costs involved in such program."
