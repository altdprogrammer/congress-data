Rept. 95-1305) Designates a specified portion of the DuNoir Basin as a segment of the Washakie Wilderness area of the Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming. Requires the closure of any roads that are constructed for timber harvesting. Repeals that portion of the Act creating the Washakie Wilderness which required that the Special Management Unit be managed so as to preserve its wilderness character. Prohibits the expenditure of funds for development or maintenance of such area prior to fiscal year 1980 in excess of those moneys that would have been expended for the area had the area continued to be managed so as to preserve its wilderness character."
