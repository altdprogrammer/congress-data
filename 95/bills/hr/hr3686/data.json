    "text": "Victims of Crime Act - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified State programs for the compensation of victims of crime. Specifies requirements for program certification, including that the program: (1) offer compensation for personal injuries suffered as a result of certain State and Federal crimes; (2) offer compensation to surviving dependents of persons whose deaths resulted from being victim to such a crime; (3) require cooperation with law enforcement agencies as a condition for recovery; (4) grant claimants the right to a hearing; and (5) subrogate the State to any claim the victim or dependent has against the perpetrator to the extent of the amount compensated by the State. States that grants made under this Act shall total 50 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of State crimes designated by the State as appropriate for compensation under its program and 100 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of crimes which would constitute designated State crimes except for the fact that the crime is subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Limits compensation with respect to any single claim to: (1) loss resulting from medical and related treatment, physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation, and past and anticipated future earnings up to $200 per week; and (2) a total of $50,000. Establishes an Advisory Committee on Victims of Crime to advise the Attorney General with respect to the administration of this Act and the compensation of victims of crime."
