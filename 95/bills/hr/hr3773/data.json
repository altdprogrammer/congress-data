Grants to the National Bureau of Standards the final authority over the selection of durable products and components of such products for which performance life designations shall be made and over the determination of the performance life of such products. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to prevent any person from violating the provisions of this Act in the same manner and with the same jurisdiction as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this Act."
