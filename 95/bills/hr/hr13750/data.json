    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1807) International Sugar Stabilization Act - =Title I: Sugar Program - Chapter 1: Short Title and Definitions= - Defines the terms used in this Act. =Chapter 2: International Sugar Agreement, 1977= - Authorizes the President, after the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, enters into force for the United States and until January 1, 1983, to: (1) regulate the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption in the customs territory of the United States, of sugar from any country not a member of the International Sugar Organization, and prohibit the entry of any shipment of sugar without a valid certificate of contribution; (2) require appropriate record-keeping as to the entry, distribution, prices, and consumption of sugar and alternative sweetners; and (3) take such other necessary or appropriate action to implement the rights and obligations of the United States under such Agreement. Establishes criminal penalties for violation of the reporting requirements of, and any regulations issued to carry out, this title. Requires the President to submit to Congress an annual report on the operation and effect of such Agreement. =Chapter 3: Import Restrictions on Sugar= - Sets the market price objective for the sugar supply year beginning after September 30, 1978, at 15 cents per pound of sugar, raw value. Sets the price objective for the 1979 sugar supply year at 15.8 cents per pound, raw value, adjusted according to a specified formula. Establishes a formula by which the price objective for each succeeding year will be increased by one percent above the price objective of the preceding sugar supply year. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to determine on a continuing basis the average daily price for United States raw sugar imports and to monitor the prices of sugar and sugar-containing products in the import trade of the United States. Authorizes price support payments to producers and processors of up to 0.75 cents per pound, raw value, for the 1978 sugar supply year in such amount as necessary to assure a total return of 15.75 cents per pound, raw value; but prohibits payments for subsequent sugar supply years through 1982. Directs the Secretary, before the beginning of each sugar supply year, to: (1) estimate whether the average daily price for United States raw sugar imports during such year will be below the price objective; and (2) if the estimate is affirmative, recommend special import duties to the President. Requires prompt publication of such recommendations in the Federal Register. Directs the Secretary to impose a global quantitative restriction on the total amount of sugar which may be entered during the sugar supply year, if at any time he determines that the special import fee imposed will not achieve its purpose. Requires the Secretary to review, from time to time, the effect of all such duties and restrictions and make appropriate adjustments in order to achieve such objective. Requires the President to proclaim promptly any special import duties recommended by the Secretary. Prohibits the President from imposing any special import duty on sugar-containing products before requesting, and taking into consideration the results of, an investigation by the United States International Trade Commission into what adverse effect, if any, such product will have, or is having, on the achievement of the price objective. Authorizes the President to proclaim a special import duty on sugar-containing products under certain conditions. Prohibits: (1) the entry into the Virgin Islands of certain sugar grown outside the United States in excess of 100 pounds annually; and (2) the export of sugar entered under a quantitative restriction, except under limited circumstances. Establishes a civil penalty for knowing violation of such prohibitions. Specifies articles of sugar exempt from the application of the import restrictions of this Title. Authorizes the President to suspend the operation of such restrictions in a national emergency with respect to sugar. =Chapter 4: Farm Labor Provisions= - Requires every producer of sugar beets and sugarcane for sugar to pay a specified minimum wage to each person employed on the farm in the production, cultivation, and harvesting of such crops. Establishes a civil cause of action against any producer who fails to pay minimum wages, allowing the employees affected to collect the amount of unpaid wages, plus an equal amount as liquidated damages. Prohibits a producer from discharging or discriminating against any employee who has participated in any way in an investigation or proceeding against the producer under this title. Prohibits a producer from charging farm employees any amount in excess of the reasonable cost of furnishing goods or services customarily furnished to employees engaged in the production. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to assure that producers furnish workmen's compensation insurance to such employees. =Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Provisions= - Requires persons engaged in the manufacture, marketing, transport, or industrial use of sugar to furnish the Secretary with specified information. Prohibits investment in sugar by officials engaged in the administration of this Act, and establishes penalties for the violation of such prohibition. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to conduct surveys and investigations to carry out this Act; and (2) to announce a daily spot price for a raw sugar in specified circumstances. States that nothing in this Act shall affect the 1978 sugar crop price support program. Authorizes the Secretary to waive portions of the principal or interest, or both, in order to encourage repayment of outstanding loans obtained from the Commodity Credit Corporation with respect to 1977 and 1978 crops of sugar beets and sugarcane. Terminates the authority of the Secretary under this Act on September 30, 1983. =Title II: Countervailing Duty Waiver Extension= - Amends the Traffic Act of 1930 to extend the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to waive countervailing duties under specified conditions. Terminates such waiver authority upon the defeat or enactment of the domestic implementing legislation on an agreement or agreements on internal and export subsidies, or on February 15, 1979, whichever is earlier. States that existing waivers, which would continue in effect, and any future waivers made during the period of the waiver authority extension are subject to the existing conditions in the law for granting waivers. =Title III: International Tin Agreement= - Authorizes the President to contribute up to 5,000 long tons of tin to the Tin Buffer Stock established under the Fifth International Tin Agreement (ITA). Authorizes the Administrator of the General Services to transfer to the International Tin Council an amount of tin specified by the President. Requires the President to report to Congress on the impact of the transfer or sale of tin metal by the United States as a participant in the Fifth ITA. Authorizes the General Services Administration to dispose of an additional 30,000 long tons of tin currently in the national and supplemental stockpiles which have been declared in excess of our national defense requirements. Establishes a special fund in the United States Treasury to receive revenues from sales of materials under this Act."
