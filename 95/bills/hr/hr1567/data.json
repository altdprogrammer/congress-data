    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-10", 
    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to suspend emission controls on motor vehicles until June 30, 1977, or 60 days after the President determines there is no significant shortage of petroleum fuels, whichever is later. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to designate specified air quality control regions as areas of significant automobile-related air pollution. Lists air quality control regions which may be so designated by the Administrator without subsequent legislative authorization. Stipulates that emission controls shall not be suspended with respect to vehicles registered to residents of designated regions. Directs the States to submit plans to implement the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that failure to submit an adequate plan or failure to take adequate enforcement action shall result in loss of entitlement to Federal funds under the Clean Air Act or under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Prohibits the Administrator and the States from enforcing motor vehicles emissions control standards in areas outside designated regions during the suspension period. Imposes criminal penalties for willful and deliberate violations of the provisions of this Act. Stipulates that, after the expiration of this Act, motor vehicles registered in areas outside designated regions shall not be required to be retrofitted nor to comply with emission standards issued pursuant to the Act as long as such vehicles remain registered in such areas."
