Authorizes the appropriation to such Fund of such sums, in addition to collected revenues, as are necessary to make the income of the Fund not less than $900,000,000 in fiscal year 1978 and each year thereafter through fiscal year 1989. Credits to a special account within the Fund the additional income to be produced by the Fund in fiscal years 1978 and 1979 in accordance with the amendments made by this Act. States that the special account shall remain available until appropriated for the acquisition of national or federally administered lands. Provides that appropriations allotted for the acquisition of land or waters for Recreation Areas of the National Park System and the National Forest System be available notwithstanding any statutory ceiling on such appropriations contained in any other provision of law enacted prior to the convening of the 95th Congress, except that such expenditures may not exceed such ceiling by a specified excess amount. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, following notice to specified committees in Congress, to modify boundaries of an area of the national park system and acquire land, waters or interests adjacent to such area. Provides that such authority shall expire ten years from the date of enactment of the authorizing legislation establishing such boundaries. Authorizes the Secretary to accept adjacent lands outside park boundaries by donation, after consultation with the duly elected governing body of the county, city, town or other jurisdiction having primary taxing authority over the affected lands. Directs the Secretary to provide advance public notice of the proposed action. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire privately owned lands within the boundaries of the Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado. Provides that lands which meet specified criteria, may be acquired at the fair market value of such lands, without improvements, prior to the Big Thompson flood of July 31, 1976. Specifies that lands which do not meet the criteria shall be acquired at no less than appraised fair market value. Provides that moneys appropriated for this purpose shall be available until expended or until January 1, 1980, whichever is earlier. Stipulates that lands which may be acquired with assistance from the fund for the Big Thompson/North Fork Canyons Recreational Lands Acquisition Project in Larimer County, Colorado, and which meet other specified criteria, may be acquired for the fair market value of such land, without improvements, as established prior to the Big Thompson Flood of July 31, 1976."
