Establishes an intergovernmental review board to consider applications, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, for exemption from the requirements of the Act that Federal agencies take no action which would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species. Specifies that the review board shall make its recommendations to the Endangered Species Committee, established by this Act. Establishes the Endangered Species Committee to make a final determination whether to grant an exemption to the requirements of this Act. Directs such decision to be made within 90 days of receiving the recommendation of the review board. Prohibits the Endangered Species Committee from granting an exemption if the Secretary of State has determined the proposed agency action to be in violation of any international obligation. Sets forth the procedure for judicial review of the Endangered Species Committee decisions. Allows the President to grant exceptions to the requirements of this Act in the case of major disaster areas. States that no final determination by a review board or by the Committee regarding such exemptions shall be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. Requires an environmental impact statement on threatened species or their critical habitat prior to a final determination of the Committee in granting an exemption. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with any State in the implementation of programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Requires that, for the imposition of a civil penalty for violation of the Act, the offense must have been committed knowingly and willingly. Provides that a person acting in self-defense shall not have any penalty imposed. Makes provisions for legally held raptors held in captivity or in a controlled environment on the effective date of this Act. Exempts certain imported antique articles from certain restrictions of the Act relating to possession and dealing in endangered species. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to designate one port within each customs region where such antique articles must enter the United States. Declares that any person who forfeited such imported antique articles to the United States on or before the enactment of this Act may, before the close of a one-year period after enactment, make application to the Secretary of Interior for return of the articles. Exempts the construction and operation of the Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project from the provisions of this Act. Declares that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to any action authorized, funded, or carried out which directly relates to military preparedness. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act."
