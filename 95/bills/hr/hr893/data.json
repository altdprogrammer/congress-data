Removes the requirement that the individually wrapped contents of such a package contain the word margarine or oleomargarine. Repeals the requirement that public eating places when serving margarine or oleomargarine must: (1) give prominent and conspicuous display, in a manner likely to be understood, of such fact; and (2) either label each separate serving margarine or oleomargarine, or serve such separate serving in a triangular shape. Requires that public eating places when serving margarine or oleomargarine must: (1) prominently and conspicuously display such fact; or (2) label such product in a manner likely to be understood by the ordinary patron in such eating place. Requires the regulation of margarine and oleomargarine by Federal agencies to be as uniform as practicable."
