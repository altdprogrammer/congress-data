    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue upon the request of an eligible applicant a social security card bearing the applicant's account number and containing a current photograph of the applicant and biographical and other personal information in a coded form capable of verification by a telephone communication with the Secretary. Requires employers to verify before employing an individual whether such individual has established a valid account and whether the individual is, in fact, the person to whom such card was issued. Establishes penalties of one year imprisonment and/or $1,000 fine for each offense for an employer who hires an individual not in possession of a valid account card on the date such individual is hired. Specifies that an account card be used only for the purposes of establishing identity and eligibility for employment or for welfare and public assistance under the Social Security Act, and prohibits government officials from demanding the production of the card for any other purposes."
