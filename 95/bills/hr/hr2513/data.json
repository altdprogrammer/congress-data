    "text": "Food Allowance for Older Americans Act - Amends the Social Security Act to add Title XX - Food Allowance for Older Americans. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to formulate and administer a food allowance program under which qualified elderly persons shall be provided with an opportunity to obtain an adequate level of nutrition through the issuance of a food allowance for each month after December, 1976 in the form of coupons that can be used only to purchase food from retail stores. Stipulates that such coupons shall be the same in form and style as those issued under the Food Stamp Act. States that an individual shall be eligible for an allowance under this Act only if such individual is: (1) 65 years of age or older; (2) the head of his or her own household; and (3) has an annual income which does not exceed $5,000. Sets the value of such allowance at $50, and shall be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the series for food of the Consumer Price Index."
