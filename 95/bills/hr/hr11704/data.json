    "text": "Nuclear Siting and Licensing Act - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to establish a licensing process for the siting, construction, and operation of nuclear power reactors which meet applicable safety and environmental criteria. Title I: Planning, Siting, and Licensing - Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to encourage or require persons proposign to construct and operate or to operate nuclear power reactors, and persons proposing to obtain site permits or such facilities to engage in open and advance planning for such addition of generating capacity and site selection. States that the Commission and interested persons shall be given the opportunity to participate in such advance planning in order to promote the early identification and resolution of issues which may exist with respect to a potential site or facility. Directs the Commission to require that a person proposing to obtain approval of a standardized facility design notify the Commission of intent to file an application therefore not less than six months prior thereto, and that persons proposing to obtain approval to construct and/or operate a production or utilization facility, or to obtain a site permit for such a facility, notify both the Commission and the State in which the facility is proposed to be located not less than six months before applying for such approval. Requires the Commission, on receiving such notification, to take steps to notify through the Federal Register and major local newspapers, concerned or affected persons. Prohibits the Commission from granting a construction permit or a combined construction permit and operating license for a thermal neutron power generation facility unless the State, a political subdivision thereof, or another public authority which has direct authority over electric generating facilities, certifies to the Commission, after a hearing, the specific need for the facility. Provides for public participation at such hearing. Provides for the approval by the Commission of limited facility site preparation by an applicant before final approval of the construction or operation permit upon the determination that there is reasonable assurance that specified findings respecting health, safety, and environmental considerations have been made. Specifies nuclear power facility licensing and construction proceedings concerning which the Commission is required to hold a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by such proceeding. Requires the Commission, in any proceeding for: (1) a combined construction permit and operating license; (2) the granting of a site permit; or (3) the approval of a standardized facility design, to hold a hearing and to admit as a party any person whose interest may be affected by such hearing. States that such hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifies the means by which public notice of such hearing shall be given. Authorizes the Commission to issue an interim operating license or an interim amendment to an operating license for a production or utilization facility, or to allow interim operation of a facility for which a combined construction permit and operating license had been issued, in advance of the conduct or completion of any required hearing. States that no such interim license or operation may be issued or commenced unless the Commission has determined: (1) that there is an urgent public need for such issuance or commencement; and (2) that any required hearings have been completed with respect to matters of public health and safety, or the common defense and security. Limits such interim license or operation to 12 months except when good cause can be shown for the extension of such period. Authorizes the Commission to issue a site permit for approval of a site for one or more thermal neutron power generation facilities prior to the filing of an application for a construction permit or combined construction permit and operating license for such facility or facilities. Sets forth the requirements for the application for such a permit. States that such a permit shall be valid for ten years. Provides for renewal of such permits. Authorizes and directs the Commission to establish procedures under which it may approve the preliminary or final design for a thermal neutron power generation facility or to approve the preliminary or final standardized designs for any major subsystem of such a facility notwithstanding the fact that no application for a construction permit or combined construction permit and operating license for such facility has been filed. States that such approval designs shall be valid for five years. Provides for the renewal of such approval. Title II: Federal and State Reviews - Provides for the review by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safety of construction permits, site permits, approvals of standardized facility designs, and extensions thereof, upon the referral to such Committee of those matters by the Commission. Directs the Commission to notify any State in which a nuclear power generation facility is proposed to be located, of the filing of an application for approval of such facility. Permits the affected State to elect to determine the environmental acceptability of and/or need for the proposed facility, or to evaluate discrete, limited aspects of the environmental acceptability of and/or need for such facility. Declares that the action of a State, in making the required determinations and evaluations, shall discharge the Commission from its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 with regard to such determinations and evaluations. Sets forth the requirements of State programs under this Title. Authorizes the Commission to make grants to any State or authorized interstate or regional agency for the purpose of assisting in the development or administration of a program for evaluating the environmental impact or determining the need of a nuclear power generating facility. Directs the Commission, with respect to any application for a site permit, for approval of a standardized facility design, for a construction permit and/or operating license, or for a manufacturing license, to establish a schedule for the conduct and completion of all required Commission reviews and decisions. Authorizes the Commission to cooperate with other Federal, State, or regional agencies with review and/or decisionmaking authority regarding new nuclear power reactor facilities. Title III: Intervenors - Authorizes the Commission to establish a pilot program for finding intervenors in initial or renewal licensing proceedings. States that the amount paid, if any, shall be determined based upon the intervenor's contribution to the proceedings. Directs that criteria for determining the eligibility for payment of an intervenor shall include: (1) the intervenor's interest in the matter; (2) the likelihood of the intervenor's participation leading to the presentation of substantive arguments and views; and (3) the necessity of such payment for the intervenor's participation. Title IV: Conforming Amendments - Amends specified provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to conform to the changes effected by this Act. Title V: Effective Dates - Establishes the dates on which the provisions set forth in this Act shall become effective."
