Rept. 95-820) Sets forth rules governing the interstate succession of all interests in trust or restricted land within the Umatilla Reservation in the State of Oregon. States that the interstate Indian's land shall descend in equal shares to his or her children and to the issue of any deceased child. Specifies that if no child of the decedent survives him, any interest shall descend to all other lineal descendants. States that the surviving spouse of an Indian leaving an interest in trust or restricted land is entitled to a life estate in one-half of such interest. Specifies that a surviving spouse of an Indian leaving a will must elect whether to take under the will or under this Act, unless the will evidences a clear intention that the spouse is to be entitled to both. Provides that the provisions of this Act shall apply only to estates of Umatilla Indians who die on or after the date of enactment of this Act."
