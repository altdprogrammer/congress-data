Sets forth requirements which the State plans must meet before receiving such grants, including: comprehensive health care to school-age girls (associated with the continuation of pregnancy) and to their children, family planning and counseling, infant and child day care and a coordinated program of social services. Prohibits the collection by, or submission to, the Federal or State Government of identifying information of persons receiving services under this program. Establishes a unit within the Maternal and Child Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to administer and coordinate the program established by this Act."
