Title II: National Historic Preservation Program - Renames the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as the Council on Historic Preservation. States that such Council is to administer specified Acts which relate to the historic preservation responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior and the National Park Service. Requires the Council, in furtherance of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, to establish a program to nominate historic and cultural properties of universal significance to the World Heritage Committee. Directs the Council to promote nominations to the National Register of Historic Places of any properties proposed for sale, transfer, demolition or substantial alteration as a result of any Federal agency action, to provide training, information and advice concerning techniques for the preservation of historic and cultural properties, to establish a program for the emergency acquisition of property included in the National Register and threatened with immediate demolition, to evaluate other Federal agencies programs and make recommendations to further coordination, and to report to the President and Congress on the national historic preservation program. Requires all Federal agencies, in cooperation with the appropriate State historic preservation officer, to nominate to the National Register all eligible districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects under the jurisdiction or control of such agency or that may be affected by agency action, and to assume responsibility for the preservation of such properties included or eligible to be included in the National Register. Allows the transfer of control of such properties to the Secretary of the Interior. Title III: Maritime Preservation Program - Directs the Council to establish a separate section of properties significant in American maritime history, architecture, archaeology, and culture within the National Register and accompanying programs of matching grants-in-aid and demonstration grants-in-aid to States and local governments and nonprofit organizations whose purpose is the preservation of such properties. Subjects grants to terms and conditions as the Council deems appropriate. Directs the Council to: (1) issue rules and regulations providing, but not limited to, a requirement that each grant recipient obligate all funds by January 1, 1981; (2) submit annual reports on the maritime heritage preservation program to Congress; and (3) report to the President and Congress on the effectiveness and future needs of the program by January 31, 1981. Establishes the Maritime Heritage Fund, which shall cover $50,000,000 each fiscal year 1978 through 1981, from revenues under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Requires for each fiscal year the National Trust for Historic Preservation receive ten percent of the appropriation for its maritime preservation activities; up to 25 percent may be used for demonstration grants; and the number of members appointed to the Council by the President be increased to 13, one of whom shall have experience in maritime preservation. Title IV: Administrative Provisions - Provides for the administration of the Historic Preservation Fund for fiscal years 1978 through 1981. Requires each Federal agency to expend appropriated funds for the maintenance of properties included in the National Register under its jurisdiction or control."
