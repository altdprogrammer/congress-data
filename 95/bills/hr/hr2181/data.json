    "date": "1977-01-19", 
    "text": "Consumer Food Labeling Act - Title I: Truth in Food Labeling Act - Truth in Food Labeling Act - Requires, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that the labels on all foods disclose each of their ingredients in order of predominance and the amounts of the ingredients in the food. Title II: Nutritional Labeling Act - Nutritional Labeling Act - Requires any packaged consumer food product to be labeled by the processor in conformity with specified information, including: with respect to processed food products, an analysis of nutritional contents including fat content, vitamin, and protein value, fats and fatty acids, calories, and any other nutritional information deemed appropriate. Requires such label to contain a statement of the nutritional value of the food commodity, and to appear in conspicuous and easily legible type on the package. Provides that the label of any packaged consumer product which has been packaged in a container of any given net content (by weight or volume) and which afterwards is packaged in a container of a different net content, shall conspicuously set forth the amount of difference. States that the appropriate Federal agencies shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this title. Provides for injunctions in Federal courts to assure compliance with this title. Prescribes a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for any willful violation of this title; such sum to be assessed by the appropriate agency and enforced in a Federal court in the name of the United States. Title III: Open Dating of Perishable Food Act - Open Dating of Perishable Food Act - Provides, under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, that no person who manufactures or packages a perishable or semiperishable food in the form in which it is sold by retail distributors to consumers may distribute for purposes of sale a perishable or semiperishable food packaged by him in such form unless he has labeled such packaged to show the pull date for such food and the optimum temperature and humidity conditions for its storage by the ultimate consumer. Provides, with certain exceptions, that no retail distributor may sell, offer to sell, or display for sale any food whose pull date has expired. States that no person may place perishable or semiperishable foods in packages in shipping containers or in wrappings, unless such containers or wrappings are labeled by him to show the pull date. Provides that no person may change, alter, deface or remove before sale to the ultimate consumer any pull date. States that any person who violates any provision of this title shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined not more than $5,000, or both. Provides that the United States district courts shall have jurisdiction to restrain violations of this title. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit an annual report to the Congress concerning activities and enforcement of this title. Title IV: Marketing Practices Disclosure Act - Marketing Practices Disclosure Act - Requires that labels on packaged foods contain the names and places of business of the manufacturer, packer and distributor, rather than just one of the three. Title V: Consumer Food Grading Act - Consumer Food Grading Act - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, after consultation with representatives of consumers, producers, and processors, to develop and promulgate a system of retail quality grade designations for consumer food products expressed in a uniform nomenclature. Authorizes the Secretary to determine the manner in which the system of consumer food grade designations shall be displayed and disseminated to the public. Provides that in developing and updating quality grade standards, consideration shall be given to the nutritional quality and wholesomeness of food products, as well as the acceptability of the products. Requires that any food products sold more than nine months after the promulgation of applicable quality standards in accordance with this title shall either be conspicuously labeled in accordance with such standards or shall be conspicuously labeled \"not quality graded by the United States Department of Agriculture\". Title VI: Unit Pricing Act - Unit Pricing Act - Provides that no person engaged in business in the sale at retail of any packaged consumer commodity which has been distributed in commerce, or the distribution of which affects commerce, shall sell, offer for sale, or display for sale any such commodity unless: (1) the total selling price of such commodity is plainly marked by a stamp, tag, or label affixed to a principal display panel of the package; and (2) the retail unit price of such commodity is plainly marked by: (a) stamp, tag, or label affixed to a principal display panel of the package, or (b) a label or sign in close proximity to the point of display of such package, which label or sign shall also contain the name and quantity of contents of such commodity. Exempts from the requirement of marking the unit price of commodities: (1) any individual retail outlet which sells or offers for sale packaged consumer commodities and whose total gross sales do not exceed $250,000 annually unless such outlet is one of a number of outlets owned substantially or whose inventory is supplied substantially, by a single person, partnership, or corporation whose total gross sales exceed $500,000 annually; (2) any retail mandatory unit pricing laws and whose laws, in the judgment of the Federal promulgating authority, are in scope and comprehensiveness superior to the requirements of this title; except that retailers (including chainstores and affiliated stores) who operate outlets in any such geographical area shall be subject to the unit pricing requirement of this title if they also operate outlets in one or more other States or political subdivisions. Title VII: New Ingredient Notification Act - New Ingredient Notification Act - Requires a food to carry a label setting forth in a conspicuous manner any change in its ingredients for six months after such change. Title VIII: Misleading Brand Names Act - Misleading Brand Names Act - Expands the meaning of \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" under the Federal Trade Commission Act to include advertising a brand name of a product which inherently misleads the public as to the product's value, quantity, quality of contents, or performance."
