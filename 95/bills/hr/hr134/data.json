    "text": "Makes additional immigration visas available in the case of a foreign state from which the total number of immigrants admitted to the United States in any fiscal year after June 30, 1972 was less than three fourths of the average annual number of visas made available to immigrants from such state during the ten year period beginning July 1, 1955. Limits to 7,500 the total number of visas to be made available in the case of any one foreign state. Specifies the percent of additional visas to be allocated to the categories of preference and nonpreference priorities set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Stipulates that the provision of such Act which prohibits the admittance of aliens seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor shall not apply in the determination of an immigrant's eligibility to receive an additional visa as authorized by this Act. Limits the application of the provisions of this Act to four years. Stipulates that nothing in this Act modifies or affects the authority of the Attorney General in the administration of any law relating to immigration, nationality, or naturalization."
