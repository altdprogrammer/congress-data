Establishes in the Treasury a Federal Employment and Training Fund for the purpose of carrying out such assistance program. Stipulates that no loan or grant shall be made unless the Federal Prison Industries first determines that: (1) offenders shall receive wages at a rate not less than similar workers in the locality; (2) any products or services may be sold just as if non-offenders provided them; and (3) the offenders are likely by reason of their involvement in such projects to find employment following their release. Includes under the Social Security Act, and subjects to employment taxes, services performed by inmates in a penal institution. Title II: State Penal or Correctional Institutions - Authorizes the Attorney General to enter into agreements with States to assist them in carrying out offender training and employment programs comparable to that authorized under title I."
