    "text": "Directs that an otherwise proper application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a judgement of a State court be entertained in a U.S. district court without regard to whether the State court afforded the applicant an opportunity to fully and fairly litigate the issue constituting the basis of such application, so long as the applicant did not deliberately bypass a procedure through which such claim could have been presented. Prohibits any provision of law or any rule prescribed by the Supreme Court from precluding a Federal court from granting appropriate relief to a prisoner whom it has sentenced upon its finding that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, that the sentence imposed was unauthorized, or that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been denied or infringed, unless it also finds that the prisoner deliberately bypassed a procedure available to assert his constitutional rights."
