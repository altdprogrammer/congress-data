    "text": "National Home Health Care Act - Broadens the coverage of home health services under Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act and removes the 100-visit limitation presently applicable to the home health service program. Extends the coverage of posthospital home health services to include payment for items and services which the individual could otherwise obtain in a skilled nursing facility. Amends Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require the inclusion of home health services in a State's Medicaid program and permit the payment of rent under such program for elderly and handicapped persons who would otherwise require nursing home care. Provides expanded Federal funding for congregate housing for the displaced and the elderly by increasing the amount available for such housing under the low-income housing program. Establishes, in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a Home Health Patient Ombudsman, who shall be appointed and provided with adequate staff and facilities by the Secretary. Makes it the duty and responsibility of the ombudsman to monitor specified programs under the Social Security and the various medical assistance programs under the State plans approved pursuant to such Act, and to maintain such oversight of those programs and their operation and administration as may be necessary to: (1) assure that home health patients under such programs are receiving the care to which they are entitled: (2) provide safeguards against over-charging for home health services; (3) identify abuses against home health patients; (4) receive, handle, and expedite complaints by home health patients; (5) recommend to the Secretary any changes in the regulations affecting home health services which may appear necessary or desirable; and (6) take appropriate action (including the transmission of findings to the Attorney General) with respect to abuses and violations of law affecting the provision or receipt of home health services under such programs. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of extending to the Medicare program the prospective cost-related method of computing payments to nursing homes and home health agencies which is currently provided under the Medicaid program."
