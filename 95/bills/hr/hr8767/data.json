Empowers the Corporation to issue temporary restraining orders summarily suspending deposit insurance if such approval is not obtained. States that whenever an individual, company, or insured bank makes loans secured by 25 percent of the outstanding voting stock of an insured bank, such party must file a report with the Corporation."
