    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1978-04-10", 
    "text": "Family Farm Development Act - Title I: Price Supports - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to establish the price support of milk, for the first 500,000 pounds of annual production per dairy producer, at not less than 100 percent of parity. Establishes price supports of corn, upland cotton, mohair, soybeans, wheat, and wool at 90 percent of parity, and prohibits the Commodity Credit Corporation from selling any of such crops owned or controlled by it at less than 110 percent of parity. Declares the Commodity Credit Corporation the seller or marketing agent for all export sales of wheat, feed grains, and soybeans in raw form. Requires the Corporation to negotiate the best possible price in all such sales, with 100 percent parity as price goal. Authorizes a commodity owner to stipulate the minimum price for such sales. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to provide marketing certificates to active producers of all commodities except livestock and poultry, in an amount equal to the national production goal for each such commodity, but aggregating in value not in excess of $500,000 per producer or farm owner. Directs the Secretary to establish a uniform storage rate of not less than 20 cents per bushel for oats, and not less than 25 cents per bushel for wheat and other feed grains. Directs the Secretary to establish soil quality standards, and best management practices, and to develop a plan of such practices for each land operator which will bring him, over a five-year period, into compliance with such soil quality standards. Requires annual inspection and issuance of a certificate of compliance with such a plan to make any operator or owner eligible for the price support and other assistance provided by this Title. Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Farm Tax Equity Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit the deductions attributable to the trade or business of farming to a maximum amount consisting of the sum of the taxpayer's gross income plus $15,000 reduced by the amount by which the nonfarm adjusted gross income of such taxpayer exceeds $15,000. States that such limitation shall not apply if the taxpayer's nonfarm adjusted gross income does not exceed $15,000, or if the taxpayer elects to compute his taxable income on the accrual method of accounting. Requires the accrual method of accounting for any person engaged in the trade or business of farming whose gross income from farming exceeds $100,000. Title III: Grants to Preserve Family Farms - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants of from $100,000 to $500,000 to county and local governments and nonprofit community organizations to purchase land suitable for farming and to sell such land to new or young farmers. Requires the Secretary to give priority to applicants who demonstrate that the preservation of family farming is of vital importance to the area in which the applicant is located. Title IV: Small Farm Ownership and Operating Loan Programs - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Secretary to make and insure real estate and appropriate technology loans (at not more than five percent interest), and operating loans (at not more than three percent interest) to owners and operators of small or family farms, and to farmers or ranchers with a low income. Title V: Farm Marketing Programs - Directs the Division of Cooperative Marketing of the Department of Agriculture to give primary emphasis to services to small and moderate-sized family farmers. Amends the National School Lunch Act to require the purchase of locally grown fresh food products for the school lunch program, with maximum supportive effect on the local family farms. Directs the Secretary to extend the Indiana pilot project into 12 States under which county extensions will use computer terminals to assist family farmers in attaining information clarifying various market alternatives. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, not to exceed 75 percent of costs, to establish a direct marketing system between consumers and farmers. Title VI: Family Farm Development Service - Establishes within the Department of Agriculture a Family Farm Development Service, containing a Research Board, which shall devise a national long-term plan for the development of a system providing incentives enabling small and moderate-size family farmers to increase the energy efficiency of their farming operations. Title VII: Research Program - Directs the Administrator of the Family Farm Development Service to conduct an intensive research grant program concerning the improvement of small and moderate-sized family farms. Title VIII: Education, Training, and Demonstration Programs - Amends the Rural Development Act of 1972 to establish extension programs providing small farmers with education and demonstration assistance, using paraprofessionals. Directs the Secretary: (1) to provide small farmers with pest control and soil improvement instruction; (2) to establish a program encouraging family farmers to hire and train apprentice farmers; and (3) to establish a scholarship program for farmers and potential farmers to study organic farming methods in foreign countries. Title IX: Unfair Trade Practices - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to make it an unfair or deceptive practice affecting commerce for any person engaged in the retail sale of food to sell any food product without a sign at the point of sale containing the amount received by farmers for the agricultural commodities which were used to produce the food product involved. Title X: Food Price Stabilization - Establishes a Food Price Review Board to monitor increases in the price of any food product, and to recommend to the President the issuance of orders limiting or adjusting the amount of any such increase so that it is equal to, and not more than, the amount of any increase in the price received by the grower or producer of any raw food product involved. Empowers the President to issue such orders. Title XI: Miscellaneous - Defines terms used in this Act."
