    "text": "Title I: States the findings and purposes of this Act. Title II: National Agricultural Producers Board - Establishes within the Department of Agriculture the National Agricultural Producers Board, composed of 50 members elected by agricultural producers, which shall assist the Secretary of Agriculture in the development of policy and determine the optimum production level for each agricultural commodity which would result in a National Market Equilibrium. Title III: Mechanism for Attaining Market Equilibrium - Directs the Board to determine, for any commodity in any year, the proper combination of production or marketing agreements necessary to assure market equilibrium (a National Market Determination). Requires a nationwide referendum of the producers of each affected commodity for the purpose of expressing preferences on the form of agreements. Title IV: Pricing Policy - Prohibits the sale, trade, or other disposition of any agricultural commodity at less than 100 percent of parity. Title V: Imports - States that imports of all agricultural products which are domestically produced must be stopped until 100 percent of parity is reached, and then limited to only the amount that American producers cannot supply. Title VI: Reserves - Requires the storage of all quantities of agricultural commodities produced in excess of the total market equilibrium quantities. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a National Strategic Reserve of any commodity. Prohibits sales from such Reserve at less than 100 percent of parity prices. Title VII: Applicability of Other Laws - Declares inapplicable to any commodity for which the National Marketing Determination has been made, the provisions of all other laws to the extent inconsistent with this Act. Title VIII: Sanctions - Sets criminal penalties for any person who buys, sells, trades, or otherwise disposes of any agricultural commodity in violation of this Act."
