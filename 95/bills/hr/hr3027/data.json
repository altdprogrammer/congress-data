    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to formulate and administer a fuel stamp program under which, at the request of any State chief executive, an eligible household within such State shall have the opportunity to offset a portion of its fuel bill with coupons amounting to an allotment of $25 monthly. Requires that such coupons be issued to households: (1) in which a member has attained age 60; and (2) which has an annual income under $6,500. Restricts the use of such coupons to the payment of fuel bills, or to the offset of rent due where a fuel bill is not paid directly. In the latter case, requires a landlord to use such coupons to pay a portion of his fuel bill and prohibits him from increasing rents in connection with or as a result of the issuance of fuel stamps. Requires each State desiring to participate in the program to submit for approval a plan of operation, and directs each participating State to assume responsibility for the certification of eligible households."
