    "text": "Amends the National Labor Relations Act to stipulate that, subject to specified provisions, it shall not be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to engage in, or induce any individual employed by any person to engage in, a strike, refusal to perform services, or threat thereof (1) at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building or other structure; and (2) directed at any of several persons in the construction industry who are either joint venturers or in the relationship of contractor and subcontractor in the performance of such construction, alteration, painting or repair. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit a strike, refusal to work, or threat thereof (1) in violation of an existing collective bargaining contract; (2) in furtherance of a labor dispute concerning only working conditions of individuals employed at other common construction sites; (3) directed at a person who is not engaged primarily in the construction industry and who, through its employees, is installing or servicing its own products or is doing construction work at one of its prior facilities; or (4) which presently otherwise constitutes an unfair labor practice. Prohibits common construction site picketing or threats thereof for specified purposes, including (1) to remove or exclude from such site any individual on the ground of sex, race, creed, color, or national origin; (2) to cause or attempt to cause discrimination on the basis of labor union membership; or (3) to force, require, or persuade any person to refrain or cease from dealing in products or systems of another processor or manufacturer. Requires a labor organization, before engaging in an activity permitted by this Act, to give prior notice to certain persons and receive written authorization from the national or international labor organization with which it is affiliated. Sets forth separate prerequisites in the case of activities to be conducted with respect to sites located at military installations or at Federal facilities or installations a major purpose of which is, or will be, the development, production, testing, or firing of munitions, weapons, missles, or space vehicles."
