    "text": "National Public Employee Relations Act - Grants to employees of State and local governments and agencies thereof the rights to (1) form, join, or assist any labor organization; (2) bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing with respect to wages, hours, and other working conditions; and (3) engage in other concerted activities for purposes of mutual aid protection free from interference, restraint, or coercion. Specifies unfair labor practices by public employers, including: (1) interference with employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed under this Act; (2) domination or assistance in the formation or administration of any labor organization; (3) discrimination in personnel actions so as to discourage or encourage membership in any labor organization; and (4) refusal to bargain collectively in good faith with an exclusive representative. Makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to (1) restrain or coerce an employee in the exercise of rights guaranteed under this Act or an employer in the selection of his representative for collective bargaining or adjustment of grievances, (2) cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in derogation of the employer's obligations under this Act or against an employee who is not a union member for specified reasons, or (3) refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with an employer. Establishes a National Public Employee Relations Commission to designate appropriate collective bargaining units, oversee selection of employee representatives, certify elected representatives, and to hear complaints and issue orders with respect to unfair labor practices under this Act. Sets forth procedures for the selection of employee representatives, for hearing complaints of unfair labor practices, and for appeal of final orders of the Commission relative to such complaints. Stipulates that a collective bargaining agreement may contain a grievance procedure culminating in final and binding arbitration of unresolved grievances and disputed interpretations of agreements. Directs a party desiring to modify or terminate a collective bargaining agreement, or otherwise modify terms and conditions of employment, to notify the other party and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Sets forth procedures whereby the Service may initiate fact finding upon expiration of an existing collective agreement or 30 days following the certification of a representative in order to facilitate resolution of a dispute concerning the collective bargaining agreement."
