Rept. 95-563) Arms Control and Disarmament Act Amendments - Authorizes the President to appoint a Special Representative for Arms Control and Disarmament Negotiations. Removes the requirement that Arms Control and Disarmament Agency contracts and grants be with United States institutions and persons. States the sense of the Congress that adequate verification of compliance with arms control agreements should be an indispensable part of such agreements. Requires that the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency report to the Congress his determinations of the degree to which verification can be made in such agreements, as well as the number of professional personnel within the Government assigned to verification and the funds allocated to the verification task in the budget of the Agency. Allows the Agency an exception from the appointment and classification provisions of the competitive Civil Service system to the extent the Director deems such action necessary, for a period of two years. Authorizes the appropriation of $16,600,000 for the agency in fiscal year 1978. Earmarks $2,000,000 of such sum for the purpose of furthering the nuclear safeguards programs of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
