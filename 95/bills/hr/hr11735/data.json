    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to define pay television as programing for which a charge per person or per channel (or other direct charge) is made, and which is distributed by a cable television system or any means utilizing public frequency. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to regulate pay television in such a manner that: (1) pay television will be consistent with the healthy maintenance of free over-the-air television broadcast services available to the public, including persons who are unable or unwilling to subscribe to pay television; and (2) pay television program originations will be innovative and supplemental to the program services of free over-the-air television broadcast services and will result in increased outlets for community expression, diverse viewpoints, and educational services so that the public need not purchase pay television for programs that otherwise would be free."
