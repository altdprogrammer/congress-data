Amends Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to increase allocations to the Disability Insurance Trust Fund for 1979 and 1980. Decreases the level of income subject to employment and self employment tax for such years. Establishes the Hospital Insurance General Revenue Trust Fund. Provides for the deposit of general revenue funds into such Trust Fund to compensate for revenue losses due to lower tax rates during 1979-80. Creates a Board of Trustees for the Trust Fund and defines its membership and duties."
