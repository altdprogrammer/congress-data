    "text": "Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Civil Aeronautics Board, in carrying out its duties with respect to the encouragement and development of an air transportation system adapted to the present and future needs of the foreign commerce of the United States, to take into account whether the laws or requirements of foreign countries or foreign air carriers result in discrimination or discriminatory practices against, or differential treatment of, American citizens traveling abroad on the basis of race, color, or religion. Directs the Board to hold hearings upon complaints alleging such discrimination when after a preliminary investigation there appear to be reasonable grounds for such a complaint. Requires the Board upon a finding that such discrimination exists, and unless overriding considerations of national interest require otherwise and the Congress is so advised, to suspend the operating certificates of all air carriers to serve such country and the permits issued to foreign air carriers of such nationality until such country has acted to end such discrimination."
