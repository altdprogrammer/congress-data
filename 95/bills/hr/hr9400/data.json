    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1978-07-28", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #614 (254-69)) Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in any United States district court for the relief of institutionalized persons in specified State or local facilities whenever the Attorney General has cause to believe that the conditions of the institution cause them to suffer grievous harm and the constitutional rights of such persons are being violated pursuant to a pattern or practice of such violations. Allows a court to transmit a copy of a petition or complaint regarding conditions in a prison, jail, or other correctional facility to the Attorney General for consideration as to the appropriateness of instituting a civil action in accordance with this Act. Permits the Attorney General to institute a civil action in any appropriate district court against any State, political subdivision thereof, or any official, employee, or agent believed to be subjecting persons confined in such facility to conditions which deprive them of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution. Requires the Attorney General to sign the complaint personally. Requires the Attorney General, prior to civil action, to notify in writing the Governor or appropriate officials of the State, to give the appropriate officials a reasonable time to develop a plan to correct such deprivations and to consult with the Governor, officials, and director of the institution regarding available Federal assistance which may aid in the correction of such pattern or practice of deprivation. Permits the Attorney General to intervene in such private suits upon certification that the appropriate officials have been notified of the alleged violation and the case is of general public importance. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate minimum standards for prisoner grievance procedures, certify grievance resolution systems, and provide for an advisory role for employees and inmates of correctional institutions in the formulation, implementation, and operation of a grievance system. Allows either House of the Congress to veto standards promulgated by the Attorney General within 30 legislative days after such proposed standards have been published in the Federal Register. Authorizes a court to continue for up to 90 days any action filed by an imprisoned adult under certain Civil Rights Acts actions so that administrative remedies may be pursued."
