Rept. 95-1092) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit a tax credit for payments made by a taxpayer to an individual for household and dependent care services if such individual is a dependent of the taxpayer for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a dependency exemption or is a child of the taxpayer under 19 years of age. Eliminates the requirement that such services qualify as employment for purposes of the Federal Insurance contributions Act. States the the provisions of this Act shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1977."
