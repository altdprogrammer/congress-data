Lists the objectives of such program, including: (1) the development of technology to make new and existing structures earthquake resistant; (2) the implementation of an earthquake prediction system in areas of high and moderate seismic risk; and (3) the development of model codes and other means to coordinate information about seismic risk with land use policy and building activity. Specifies the Federal agencies which are to participate in, and identifies activities to be conducted under, the program. Establishes a National Advisory Committee on Earthquake Hazard Reduction to review and advise the President on matters regarding the earthquake hazard reduction program.
