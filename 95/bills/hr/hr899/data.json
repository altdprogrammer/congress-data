Provides that the amount of veterans benefits to which any payee was entitled under Title 38 of the U.S. Code for the month in which his death occurs shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such benefits to which such payee would have been entitled had he lived for the entire month, as the number of days such payee lived in such a month bears to the total number of days in such month. Provides that the amount of death compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or death pension to which a payee shall shall be entitled for the month in which the death of the individual occurred on which the payment of such compensation or pension is based shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such compensation or pension, as the case may be, which would be payable for such entire month, as the number of days in such month after the date on which such death occurred bears to the total number of days in such month."
