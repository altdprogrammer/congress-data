Stipulates that the rates imposed by the Corporation shall provide sufficient revenues in each calendar year to provide the Corporation with a rate of return of any investment of the United States in the Saint Lawrence Seaway which is equal to the rate of return receivable by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada on such investments by the Government of Canada."
