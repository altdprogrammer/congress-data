Requires the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the department in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is operating to determine, with respect to each political subdivision in which one or more tuna processing plants are located, the effects of such quota upon local unemployment and underemployment. Requires the Secretary to increase such quotas in order to permit harvested tuna to be supplied to such plants upon a determination that such quotas have had a detrimental effect upon local employment."
