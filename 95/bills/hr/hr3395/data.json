    "date": "1977-02-09", 
    "text": "Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove from the class of aliens whose status may be adjusted by the Attorney General in his discretion to that of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence: (1) alien crewmen; (2) aliens who hereafter continue in or accept unauthorized employment (excepting specified relatives); and (3) specified aliens admitted in transit without visa. Prohibits the employment or referral for employment of aliens who have not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. Directs the Attorney General to serve a citation upon an employer upon first-time violation of this Act. Establishes a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each alien if a violation occurs within two years after the service of a citation. Permits a civil penalty to be imposed only after an opportunity for hearing and after the Attorney General has determined that a violation did occur. Provides that an employer who is assessed a civil penalty and thereafter violates this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by one year imprisonment, or both, for each alien in respect to whom any violation occurs. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action and to secure appropriate relief against any person who fails or refuses to hire or has discharged any individual or has failed or refused to refer any individual for a fee for employment because of such individual's national origin. Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to disclose to the Attorney General the name and most recent address of any illegal alien who is receiving assistance under the Social Security Act. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both."
