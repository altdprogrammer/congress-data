    "date": "1977-03-02", 
    "text": "Permits the Secretary of Agriculture to implement an emergency feed program for assistance in the preservation and maintenance of livestock in any area of the United States including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where, because of natural catastrophe, the Secretary determines that an emergency exists. Requires that for any person to receive such assistance he: (1) must have suffered a substantial loss in the livestock feed normally produced on his farm for his livestock; (2) must not have sufficient feed for his livestock for the projected period of the emergency; and (3) must make feed purchases in quantities larger than the quantities of feed purchases that he would normally make. Limits reimbursement of eligible persons to 50 percent of the cost of the feed purchased. Directs the Commodity Credit Corporation to administer the program. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized disposal of any feed for which a person has been reimbursed under this program. Repeals specified current provisions of The Agricultural Act of 1949 dealing with: (1) distress relief assistance in the preservation and maintenance of foundation herds; (2) limitations on the costs borne by the Commodity Credit Corporation in the administration of distress relief assistance; and (3) civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized disposal of any feed grains furnished under such relief program."
