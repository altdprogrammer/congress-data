    "text": "Congressional Pay Reform Act - Amends the Federal Salary of 1967 to: (1) make recommendations for rates of pay for Members of Congress and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, transmitted by the President to Congress, subject to the approval of Congress under this Act; and (2) specify that such recommendations may be considered approved if each House of the Congress passes a specific resolution granting such approval within 180 calendar days of continuous session after the date of the President's transmittal of such recommendations. Sets forth the form of the resolution granting such approval, and the rules and procedure to be followed in each House with respect to the consideration of such resolution. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to establish the annual rates of pay for Members of Congress, Delegates to the House of Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate and House majority and minority leaders at the rates in effect on September 30, 1976, until otherwise changed by law. Declares that if any recommendations transmitted to the Congress by the President on January 17, 1977, relating to rates of pay for such positions take effect before enactment of this Act, the rates of pay for such positions will be those in effect on September 30, 1976, unless such recommendations are approved by Congress in accordance with this Act."
