Amends the Federal Salary Act to remove the requirement that the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries conduct periodic reviews of the salaries of specified executive and legislative positions. Declares that the annual rate of salary of the Vice President shall, until otherwise provided by law, be the rate in effect for such office on September 30, 1976. Specifies that basic pay rates for certain executive, legislative, and judicial positions may not be increased until the President determines that there are in effect codes of conduct applicable to every individual in such position."
