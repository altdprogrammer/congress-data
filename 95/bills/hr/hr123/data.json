Empowers the Board to issue subpenas, conduct adjudicatory hearings (exempted from the Administrative Procedure Act), and award compensation and attorneys' fees. Authorizes appropriations of $2,000,000 for compensation and such other funds as may be necessary for the Board to carry out its functions. Provides for the subrogation of the United States Government to claims for injuries compensated by the Board."
