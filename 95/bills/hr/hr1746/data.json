Allows the President to exempt from such an order any shipment of chromium in any form which is in transit to the United States on the date of enactment of this Act. Requires that steel mill products containing chromium not be imported while such executive order is in effect without the filing of a certificate of origin with the Secretary of the Treasury unless such shipment is released by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to carry out this provision. Allows the President to suspend the enforcement provisions of this Act if he determines that such suspension would encourage meaningful negotiations and further the peaceful transfer of governing power from minority rule to majority rule in Southern Rhodesia."
