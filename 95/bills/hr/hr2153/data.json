Authorizes the Secretary to make such grants, and to enter into contracts, with such entities and with individuals for projects for: (1) research and research training in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of vitiligo; and (2) the development or programs to educate the public concerning the nature and inheritance of the disease. States that participation by any person in any program under this Act shall be wholly voluntary. Sets forth requirements for applicants of grants under this Act, including the requirement that all test results, medical records, and other information regarding treatment of any person treated in connection with a project assisted under this Act shall be kept confidential, unless such person consents to the release of such information. Requires the Secretary to annually prepare and submit to the President for transmittal to Congress a comprehensive report on the administration of this Act."
