    "text": "Petroleum Marketing Practices Act - Title I: Franchise Protection - Prohibits a franchisor from prematurely cancelling a motor fuel franchise unless written notification of intent to terminate is furnished to the franchisee and the franchisee has failed to comply with reasonable terms of the franchise agreement. Permits cancellation of the franchise, with 180 days notice, when an event occurs which is relevant to the operation of the franchise relationship, as a result of which termination of the franchise is reasonable. Prevents a franchisor from failing to renew a franchise unless written notification is provided to the franchisee and the franchisee has failed to comply with any reasonable term of the franchise, without reasonable excuse or justification. States that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to trial franchises. Authorizes civil actions in United States district courts to enforce the provisions of this Act. Title II: Moratorium on Refiners Increasing Percentage of Distribution of Gasoline Through Refiner Operated Retail Outlets - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to promulgate a rule under the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to require refiners to submit monthly reports for calendar years 1972 and 1975 on (1) the total volume of gasoline distributed by such refiner for sales through retail outlets, and (2) the percentage of such volume distributed for sale through refiner operated retail outlets. Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prohibit for a two year period any refiner from distributing gasoline for sale through refiner operated retail outlets if the volume of such gasoline exceeds a specified percentage. States that violation of such rule shall be considered an unfair method of competition affecting commerce. Directs the FTC to study and report to the Congress on the legislative or regulatory means which the Commission recommends to promote competition in the marketing of automotive gasoline, including recommendations for appropriate prohibitions or discriminatory pricing practices and the appropriateness of specified price differentials and purchaser distinctions. Title III: Octane Disclosure - Requires the FTC to prescribe rules for determining octane ratings of gasoline and displaying such ratings. Prohibits any distributor from making any representation respecting the octane rating of such gasoline unless the gasoline has been tested in accordance with such procedures and the results are fairly disclosed."
