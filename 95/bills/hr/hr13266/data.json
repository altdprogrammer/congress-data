    "text": "Health Maintenance Organization Amendments - Extends the authorization of appropriations under the Public Health Service Act through fiscal year 1981 for: (1) grants and contracts for surveys of the feasibility of establishing, operating or expanding health maintenance organizations (HMO's); and (2) grants, contracts, loans and loan guarantees for planning and initial development costs related to the establishment of HMO's. Excuses HMO's from providing basic or supplemental health services if the organization is unable to provide such services because of an emergency or a war-risk hazard. Excludes from the definition of basic health services, any health service which the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare determines by regulation is unusual or infrequently provided and is not generally recognized by health professionals as appropriate for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of an illness or injury. Increases the aggregate amount of principal of loans which may be made or guaranteed, or both, for the initial cost of operation of an HMO. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to HMO's for projects for the acquisition or construction of ambulatory health care facilities and for the acquisition of equipment for facilities acquired or constructed with such loan and to guarantee to lenders: (1) their loans to nonprofit private HMO's for such projects; and (2) their loans to private HMO's for such projects which will serve medically underserved populations. Requires the Secretary to establish a National Health Maintenance Organization Intern Program to provide, through the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or HMO's, training to individuals to become administrators of HMO's or to assume other managerial positions with HMO's. Requires each HMO: (1) to file with the Secretary such information as the Secretary may require concerning the fiscal operations of the HMO; and (2) to provide a reasonable opportunity for the public to inspect such information."
