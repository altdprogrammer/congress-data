Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to allow common carriers subject to the provisions of such Act to provide free or reduced rate transportation to persons 65 years of age or older and to handicapped persons and their attendants. Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to direct the Secretary of Transportation, in providing assistance under such Act, to give preferential treatment to State and local public bodies which agree to adopt and maintain specially reduced rates, not exceeding 50 percent of the regular rates, for handicapped persons and persons over 65. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and loans to States and local public bodies in order to assist them in providing mass transportation services which will meet the needs of handicapped persons and persons over 65. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe standards for the design of buildings, structures, and facilities which are provided with financial assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act to insure that persons 65 or over and the physically or mentally handicapped will have ready access to, and use of, those buildings, structures, and facilities. Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants for special transportation research and demonstration projects for the handicapped and the elderly. Authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for the remainder of fiscal year 1976 and $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1977 to carry out such grant program."
