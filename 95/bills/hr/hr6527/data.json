Specifies the kinds of employees who may not constitute a unit. Grants labor organizations which have been given exclusive recognition below the agency level national consultation rights, and requires that such organizations be informed of proposed changes in conditions of employment. Stipulates that a labor organization, accorded exclusive recognition, becomes the exclusive representative of all employees in the unit, and requires that such organization represent the interest of all such employees regardless of organization membership. Requires that labor organizations be given the opportunity to be represented at discussions between management and employees concerning personnel policies and practices, and matters affecting general working conditions, and that both parties meet and negotiate in good faith. Stipulates that any policy or regulation which affects conditions of employment of employees of an agency for which a labor organization holds exclusive recognition at the agency level shall be subject to negotiation.

Requires agencies to honor written assignments from employees which authorize the deduction from wages of amounts for the payment of regular dues of labor organizations having exclusive recognition, without cost to employees or organizations. Requires each employee in a unit having an exclusive representative, who is not a member of a recognized organization, to pay such organization an amount equal to the fees paid by a member. Defines conduct which will be considered an unfair labor practice for agencies and labor organizations. Authorizes the Authority to prevent such practices. Requires the General Counsel of the Authority to investigate charges of unfair labor practices, and authorizes the General Counsel to issue a complaint against such agency or organization. Requires the Authority to conduct hearings on such complaints and authorizes the subpena of documents and witnesses. Prescribes remedies for violations of this Act. Requires the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, upon request, to provide assistance to agencies and labor organizations in the resolution of negotiation impasses.

Outlines the procedure for judicial review in the United States courts of appeals of the Authority's orders. Authorizes the Authority to petition the appropriate United States district court for temporary relief. Stipulates that labor organizations and their members are subject to specified reporting and disclosure procedures.
