Provides that the natural or prior adoptive parent of any such child shall have no rights or privileges under such Act. Eliminates the limit on the number of alien children that may be adopted. Raises from 16 to 18 the age limit for certain children born outside the United States eligible for automatic U.S. citizenship. Removes certain naturalization requirements regarding adopted alien children."
