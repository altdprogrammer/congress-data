Requires the Commission to submit to the President and Congress an interim report of its activities by June 30, 1978, and a final report by December 31, 1978, at which time the Commission shall cease to exist. States that such final report may propose such constitutional amendments, legislative enactments, and administrative action as might be necessary to carry out the Commission's recommendations. Permits the President to submit to Congress reorganization plans to implement any recommendation of the Commission. Makes such plan effective 60 days after such plan has been submitted unless disapproved by Congress. Permits the President to submit such a plan up until January 1, 1980. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 903; 905)"
