    "text": "Omnibus Energy Conservation Act - Title I: Energy Conservation Extension Service - Establishes an Energy Extension Service in the Energy Research and Development Administration to develop and implement a comprehensive program for the identification and application of energy conserving practices and techniques. Stipulates that programs shall provide for technical assistance and practical demonstration in the agricultural, commercial, residential, and small business sectors. Stipulates that such program shall be implemented in a manner designed to minimize conflict with existing services in the private sector of the economy. Establishes procedures and criteria for the development of State plans for implementing the provisions of this title. Allows for Federal development of plans for States in which an acceptable plan has not been submitted. Requires the Director of the National Energy Extension Service to develop guidelines governing the submission of such plans in accordance with prescribed requirements. Establishes an Interagency Advisory Group to assist in the dissemination of information with respect to energy extension programs throughout Federal agencies involved in energy-related programs. Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to develop a comprehensive program and plan for coordination of Federal energy education and information dissemination programs. Stipulates that such plan shall detail procedures for assessing the energy efficiency of various Federal programs. Establishes a National Energy Extension Service Advisory Board to conduct a continuing review of the programs developed under this title. Title II: State Energy Conservation Research and Development Institutes - Authorizes the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to provides financial assistance to qualified energy conservation research, development, and demonstration institutes, as designated by Governors of participating States. Authorizes the Administrator to make matching grants to such institutes for specific energy conservation projects. Requires annual reports to the President and Congress by the Administrator concerning the disposition of funds under this title. Title III: Energy Efficiency Research, Development, and Demonstration Programs - Directs the Administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration to establish the Energy Conservation Research, Development and Demonstration Project. Stipulates that the Project shall include programs for (1) research and development in areas of energy conservation and energy use efficiency, including design of new equipment, processes, products, transportation systems, and living patterns; (2) demonstration of residential energy use efficiency in new and existing houses and apartments; and (3) loans to assist industrial, commercial, agricultural, and governmental energy use efficiency demonstration projects. Directs the Administrator to develop performance standards and criteria for energy efficiency equipment and processes for use in residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, and governmental sectors. Directs heads of appropriate Federal agencies to arrange for the procurement of energy efficiency equipment and projects developed through the programs authorized by this title. Directs the Administrator to assess the effects of tax, regulatory, financial, or other factors which may result in suboptimal energy efficiency and to study the costs and benefits of increased energy use efficiency. Title IV: Amendments to Energy Policy and Conservation Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Federal Energy Administrator to establish a voluntary standards and certification program for products designed to conserve energy in buildings. Prohibits persons from representing that consumer products have been certified unless such product has been tested and approved in accordance with prescribed procedures."
