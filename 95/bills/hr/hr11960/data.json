Title II: Permanent Storage of Radioactive Waste - Directs the Secretary in consultation with other Federal agencies to conduct a study to evaluate methods of providing permanent storage of radioactive waste and to determine the amount of storage capacity required to permanently store all radioactive waste. Requires the Secretary within two years from the date of enactment of this Act to issue a preliminary report on the results of such study. Directs the President to evaluate the final report and issue a plan for the permanent storage of radioactive waste. Stipulates that the plan shall take effect after 60 calendar days of Congressional session unless rejected by the adoption of a concurrent resolution.
