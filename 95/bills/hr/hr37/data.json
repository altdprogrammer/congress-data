Authorizes the Administrator to make financial payments to affected States, localities, and Indian tribes for the financing of essential community development, and planning resulting from the construction of any facilities assisted by this Act. Requires full reports to Congressional committees on proposed Federal actions under this Act. Directs the Administrator to submit a comprehensive plan for energy production and conservation demonstration programs to the Congress. Establishes a separate fund in the Treasury to finance the programs authorized by this Act. Makes funds from the Geothermal Resources Development Fund available for loan guarantees for geothermal resource development and demonstration projects.
