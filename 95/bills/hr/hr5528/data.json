    "text": "Legal Services Corporation Amendments Act - Amends the Legal Services Corporation Act to eliminate the requirement that no more than six of the eleven members of the Legal Services Corporation Board of Directors be of the same political party. Subjects the Corporation and each State advisory council established under such Act to Government in the Sunshine Act requirements regarding open meeting. Authorizes the Corporation to carry out its research, training, and assistance functions by means of grant of contract. Permits up to ten percent of the funds appropriated to the Corporation to be used for such purpose. Requires a court appointing an attorney employed by an organization receiving assistance under the Legal Services Corporation Act to provide reasonable compensation for such attorney, unless the appointment is made pursuant to a law or practice applied generally to all lawyers appearing before the court. Repeals restrictions on political activities unrelated to legal assistance with respect to attorneys receiving more than one-half their professional income from an organization established for the sole purpose of providing assistance under the Legal Services Corporation Act. Revises guidelines regarding eligibility for, and priorities relative to, such assistance. Revises the limitations on the use of funds made available by the Corporation to (1) permit the provision of legal assistance with respect to criminal matters where a person is charged with an offense involving hunting, fishing, trapping, or gathering fruit of the land, a defense asserted involvers rights arising from an Indian treaty, or a person is chared with a misdemeanor or lesser offense in an Indian tribal court; (2) eliminate prohibitions against providing legal assistance to un-emancipated persons less than 18 years of age, or in connection with a proceeding relative to school desegregation or a selective service or military violation; and (3) allow activities designed to influence any executive order or ruling or any legislation under certain circumstances. Authorizes the appointment of independent hearing examiners to preside over hearings to suspend or terminate assistance under the Legal Services Corporation Act."
