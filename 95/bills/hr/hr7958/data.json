    "text": "Postal Employees' Political Activities Act - Revises provisions prohibiting Postal Service employees from engaging in political activities. Continues proscriptions against employees using their official authority or influence to interfere with the result of any election or to coerce the political action of any person. Modifies provisions relating to the solicitation and offering of political contributions by postal employees. Prohibits employees from: (1) giving or offering to give a political contribution to any individual either to vote or refrain from voting; (2) soliciting or receiving a political contribution to vote or refrain from voting; (3) knowingly giving a political contribution to a superior; (4) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution from another employee with respect to whom such employee is a superior; or (5) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution in specified facilities. Prohibits employees, with specified exceptions, from engaging in political activities while on duty, while wearing a uniform or official insignia identifying their position, or in designated areas. Requires a postal employee to notify his agency (U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission, as applicable) upon becoming a candidate for elective office. Permits such employee to take annual leave to engage in activities related to his candidacy. Directs the Civil Service Commission to investigate reports and allegations of prohibited activity. Requires the Commission to give notice to the employees involved of apparent violations and permit such employee to answer such charges in writing, except when the conduct of the Postmaster General or a presidential appointee is involved, in which case the Commission is directed to refer the matter to the Attorney General and to report it to Congress and the President. Directs the Commission to render a final decision on the apparent violation, after receipt of a timely filed answer from the employee, on the basis of the record after a hearing conducted by a hearing examiner, which record shall include the recommended decision of the hearing examiner and any exception to such decision filed by the employee. Permits an employee upon whom a penalty is imposed by an order of the Commission to seek judicial review. Specifies penalties for violation of the prohibitions contained in this Act. Directs the Commission to establish a continuing program to inform all employees of their rights of political participation and to educate employees with respect to those activities which are prohibited. Creates a specific criminal offense for extortion of political contributions from Federal personnel."
