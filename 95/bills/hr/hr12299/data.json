Rept. 95-1127) Domestic Violence Assistance Act - Establishes within the Office of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare an Office on Domestic Violence to be headed by an Administrator of Programs on Domestic Violence. Requires the Administrator to: (1) maintain a national clearinghouse on domestic violence; (2) develop a national media campaign to increase public awareness of the problem of domestic violence and the availability of service for its victims; (3) coordinate all Federal programs relating to domestic violence to avoid duplication of effort and inefficiency; and (4) utilize federally-funded research on domestic violence in reviewing Federal programs and in making reports and recommendations to Congress. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to appoint members of the Council on Domestic Violence. Sets forth the membership composition of such Council. Grants to such Council the sole responsibility for determining the awarding of grants pursuant to this Act. Directs the Council to make recommendations to the Administrator concerning the modification and improvement of programs of the Office on Domestic Violence. Requires the Council to make grants for programs designed to prevent domestic violence and to provide aid to victims of domestic violence. Requires the Council to make grants for programs to provide personnel training and technical assistance training to individuals and organizations involved in establishing or maintaining community services for victims of domestic violence. Sets forth requirements a grant applicant must satisfy to receive a grant. Requires the Council to award such grants, to the maximum extent feasible, in all regions of the United States. Stipulates that no Federal income or assistance shall be denied to any individual otherwise qualified for such assistance because such individual has received aid from any program for victims of domestic violence."
