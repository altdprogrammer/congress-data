    "text": "Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require that applications for grants for Community Development Programs demonstrate that such programs give priority to activities which benefit low- or moderate-income families. Makes specified exceptions to such requirement. Requires such program to contain activities which are part of a comprehensive strategy of mutually supportive programs to benefit persons of low- and moderate-income and their neighborhoods. Requires applicants to demonstrate that prior to submission of such application applicants prepared and followed a citizen participation plan geared to maximize the opportunity for citizens, especially low and moderate income people and residents of blighted neighborhoods, to participate in the development of such application. Authorizes any interested person to bring a civil action in United States district court on behalf of persons residing within any unit of general local government receiving assistance under this Act to secure appropriate relief for any failure by such unit to comply with this Act."
