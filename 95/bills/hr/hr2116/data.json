Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of burley tobacco in each State; and if more than one half of them approve the lease and transfer of burley tobacco allotments within the State, requires that such program remain in effect unless in a subsequent marketing year the Secretary determines that such program will impair the effectiveness of the tobacco marketing quota or price support programs."
