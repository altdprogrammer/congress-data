Authorizes Federal participation in State projects to replace such bridges after October 1, 1980. Increases the authorization for appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund for bridge replacement programs. Title II - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to extend such fund through fiscal year 1990. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to postpone specified excise tax reductions. Title III - Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to increase the excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuels, and special motor fuels. Amends the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 to stipulate that such increases shall be deposited in a special account of the Highway Trust Fund to meet the obligations incurred by the United States pursuant to bridge replacement programs."
