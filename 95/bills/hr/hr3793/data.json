    "text": "States that any statement made by or evidence obtained during questioning of an employee of an Executive agency may not be used as evidence in the course of any action for suspension, removal, or reduction in rank or pay subsequently taken against the employee, unless such employee has been advised in writing of the fact that such employee is under investigation for misconduct and has been informed of his or her right pursuant to this Act to have a representative of his or her choice present during such questioning. States that such employee may appeal any adverse personnel action taken against him or her in violation of this Act to the Civil Service Commission. Requires the appropriate administrative authority to take such action as the Commission recommends. States that the representative of an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, or the Federal Bureau of Investigation must be an employee of the same agency as the employee and must be approved by that agency for access to the information involved in the investigation. States that for employees of such agencies any appeal shall be only to the President. (Adds 5 U.S.C. 7171, 7172, 7173)"
