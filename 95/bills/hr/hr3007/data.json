Sets a new condition on the making of educational assistance payments by requiring that before they can be paid the Administrator must receive certification, from the eligible person and from the educational institution, that such person has actually attended the course in question during the month to be paid for. Holds such veteran or person liable for overpayments if he fails to pursue a course paid for."
