    "text": "Amends the rules of the House of Representatives to require all bills, resolutions, or other matters relating to the Federal civil service within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service to be referred to such Committee. Requires the chairman of any House committee considering any legislation or other matter relating to Federal civil service which has not been considered by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service to notify the chairman of such Committee and the Speaker of the House. Directs the Speaker to refer such matter to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service before such matter is considered by the House. Removes the authority of agency heads to place any position in grade GS-16, GS-17, or GS-18. Places such authority solely with the Civil Service Commissioners. Places a ceiling on the number of such placements at 5,915. Permits a majority of the Commissioners to establish the number of scientific or professional positions (not to exceed 1,238) for carrying out research and development functions which require the services of specially qualified personnel which may be established outside of the General Schedule. States that such provision shall not apply to any such scientific or professional positions so long as the individual occupying such position on the day before the enactment of this Act continues to occupy such position. Requires the Commissioners, in establishing the maximum number of positions placed in grades GS-16, GS-17, and GS-18, to take into account such scientific and professional positions. (Amends 5 U.S.C. 3104; 5108)"
