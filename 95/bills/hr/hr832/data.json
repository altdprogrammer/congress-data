    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-04", 
    "text": "Guaranteed Employment Opportunities Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish and maintain in counties with populations under 20,000 a pilot program designed to provide a guaranteed employment opportunity to any county resident who (1) is at least 18 years of age, (2) has not engaged in full-time employment during the three-week period immediately preceding the date of his application for employment under this Act, and (3) is a member of a family with an income in the previous month of less than $700. Limits eligibility to two members of each family. Directs the Secretary to reimburse any business concern in an amount equal to 50 percent of the Federal minimum wage for each eligible employee employed in a county participating in the pilot program. States that such reimbursement shall be made for a one year period and shall be made with respect to a maximum of 32 hours of work per week per eligible employee. Sets forth guidelines for the maximum number of employees for whose salaries an employer may be partially reimbursed. Provides for similar reimbursements to State and local governments with respect to employees in participating counties employed either directly by such State or local government or in any program which receives funding from such State or local government and is designed to improve the physical appearance of, or to provide recreational or cultural enrichment to, such community. Requires the Secretary or chief executive officer of a participant county to create jobs for eligible individuals who are not employed under the partial wage reimbursement program. States that wages paid to such persons shall be reimbursed in full by the Federal Government. Disqualifies a governmental body or a business concern from receiving reimbursements under this Act if the Secretary determines that it (1) has terminated or suspended the employment of an employee for the purpose of replacing such employee with an eligible employee, or (2) has terminated the employment of any eligible employee without sufficient cause during the 90 day period immediately succeeding the reimbursement period applicable to such eligible employee. Directs the chief executive officer of each participant county to establish an advisory council to assist in the administration of the pilot program."
