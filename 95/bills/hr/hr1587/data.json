Gives the Board powers to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires the Board to submit an annual report to the President and Congress on the progress of its work. Authorizes such appropriations to the Board as may be necessary to carry out its functions and activities under this Act. Stipulates that this Act shall not take effect until the Congress has received a written assurance from the President that during the President's term of office no negotiations will be conducted, or any plans initiated, for the surrender of the Canal Zone and the Panama Canal to the Republic of Panama or any international organization."
