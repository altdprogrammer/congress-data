Makes it unlawful to manufacture or transfer any handgun not meeting certain specifications or to modify any handgun if such modification results in the handgun no longer meeting such specifications. Imposes mandatory prison terms for using, offering to use, carrying, or displaying a handgun during the commission of a Federal felony of 10 years for a first offense and 25 years for subsequent offenses. Revises certain exceptions to prohibitions against commerce in firearms by repealing the generally suitable for sporting purposes test and permitting commerce in circumstances otherwise complying with such exceptions so long as the firearms involved are not concealable handguns or handguns not meeting specifications."
