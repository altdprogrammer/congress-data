Requires that a warning rather than a citation be given for a first instance violation, other than a willful or serious violation, to an employer who has not employed more than 25 employees at any time during the 30 days prior to an inspection or investigation. Prohibits the imposition of a civil penalty against an employer for a nonserious violation if (1) such employer has not previously received a citation for the same violation; and (2) the inspection upon which such citation was based resulted in the issuance of citations for ten or or fewer violations of a nonserious nature."
