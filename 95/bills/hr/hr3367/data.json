    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, under the Agricultural Act of 1949, to administer a special program in each of the crop years 1977 through 1981 whereunder wheat producers may designate up to 40 percent of a wheat acreage allotment to be planted to wheat and used for grazing or for hay rather than for commercial grain production. States that participating producers shall be ineligible for price support on any portion of an acreage allotment so used; but requires that the Secretary pay a producer an amount with respect to such portion according to a certain formula. Prohibits any crop but hay from being harvested from acreage in this special program. Deems such acreage to have been planted for harvest for the purposes of wheat acreage history. Requires that this special program be administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and prohibits the payment of disaster relief funds to any producer of wheat or feed grains participating in the program."
