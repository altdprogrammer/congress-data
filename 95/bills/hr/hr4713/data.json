    "text": "Contract Disputes Act -- Authorizes each executive agency to settle or compromise any claim or dispute with a contractor if the contract involved contains a \"disputes\" clause which provides for a resolution by a contractive officer or other Government official. Requires an agency contracting officer to settle disputes which cannot be resolved by mutual agreement. Declares such settlements to be final unless appealed within 90 days by the contractor to the appropriate agency Board of Contract Appeals. Authorizes each agency to establish such a Board if the volume of procurement of such agency justifies a Board of at least full-time members. Provides, in the event that an agency does not have such a Board, that such an appeal shall be taken to the Board of another agency as specified in this Act. Declares the decision of such a Board to be final unless appealed by the contractor or agency (with the concurrence of the Attorney General) within 120 days of the decision to the appropriate United States district court or the Court of Claims. Permits appeal of only matters of law in absence of findings of fact which are arbitrary, capricious, or grossly erroneous. Requires each agency to establish a simplified small claims procedure for claims before its Board for claims of $25,000 or less which can be invoked at the option of the contractor. (Amends 28 U.S.C. 2510; 2517)"
