    "date": "1978-08-18", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in Senate, S. Rept. 95-1126) Natural Gas Policy Act - =Title I: Wellhead Pricing= - Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to compute and publish in the Federal Register each month the maximum lawful prices for natural gas produced in the United States and the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation adjustment factor for such month. Provides a formula for determining the annual inflation adjustment factor. Stipulates that such ceiling prices apply to the month of delivery, beginning on the first day of the first month following the date of enactment of this Act. Provides that if natural gas qualifies under more than one price category, the provision that permits the seller to obtain the highest price applies. States that the ceiling price for new natural gas and certain produced from the Outer Continental Shelf shall be $1.75 per million Btu's, beginning in April 1977. Provides that for each month following, the ceiling price shall be determined according to a specified formula which takes into account the annual inflation adjustment factor. Defines \"new natural gas\" for purposes of this Act. Exempts natural gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska from such ceiling prices for new natural gas. Sets the ceiling price for natural gas produced from new, onshore production wells, at $1.75 per million Btu's beginning in April, 1977. Provides that for each month following, the ceiling price shall be determined by multiplying the previous month's ceiling price by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation adjustment factor. Sets special prices, beginning in January 1985, for natural gas which was not committed or dedicated to interstate commerce on April 20, 1977, and which was produced from certain new onshore production wells. Exempts natural gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska from such ceiling prices. Provides ceiling prices for natural gas committed or dedicated to interstate commerce on the day before the date of enactment of this Act and for which a just and reasonable rate under the Natural Gas Act was in effect. Allows the just and reasonable rates that were in effect on April 20, 1977, as converted, if necessary, to a million Btu basis, for such gas to be adjusted by multiplying such prices by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation adjustment factor. Authorizes the Commission to increase such ceiling prices if such prices are just and reasonable. Sets ceiling prices for first sales of natural gas under an existing intrastate contract or any successor to an existing intrastate contract. States that such ceiling prices shall depend on the contract price in effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and provides methods for determining ceiling prices on such basis, taking into consideration the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation adjustment factor. Provides that once the price under an existing intrastate contract equals the new gas price, the contract price may increase at a rate equal to the increase in the new gas price. Limits the operation of indefinite price escalator clauses in existing contracts, effective January 1985. States that no alteration made after May 3, 1978, of any provision of an intrastate contract in effect as of such date shall be effective to alter the application on ceiling price limitations which would have prevailed had such alteration not occurred. Provides that ceiling prices for sales under rollover contracts of natural gas which were committed or dedicated to interstate commerce on the day before the date of enactment of this Act shall be the higher of: (1) $.54 per million Btu's for April 1977, with each successive month's ceiling price escalated by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation factor; or (2) the just and reasonable rate established by the Commission and applicable to the expired contract, escalated by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation factor. Defines \"rollover contract\" to include any contract which would have been a rollover contract if the previous contract had not expired prior to the day before the date of enactment of this Act. Provides that ceiling prices for sales under rollover contracts of natural gas which were not committed or dedicated to interstate commerce on the day before the date of enactment of this Act shall be the higher of: (1) $1.00 per million Btu's for April 1977, with each successive month's ceiling price escalated by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation factor; or (2) the maximum price paid under the expiring contract, escalated each month by such inflation factor. Provides a ceiling price equal to the new natural gas ceiling price for any first sale under an intrastate rollover contract for certain State or Indian tribe royalty shares of production. Authorizes the Commission to increase ceiling prices for natural gas sales under rollover contracts if such prices are just and reasonable. Provides that the ceiling price for high-cost natural gas produced from any well, the surface drilling of which began on or after February 19,1977, if such production is from any completion location which is located at a depth of more than 15,000, feet shall be equal to the new natural gas ceiling price. Defines \"high-cost natural gas\" for purposes of this Act. Authorizes the Commission to increase such ceiling prices in order to provide reasonable incentives for the production of such high-cost natural gas. Provides that the ceiling price provisions for high-cost natural gas do not apply to natural gas for which any credit, exemption, deduction, or comparable adjustment to any Federal tax is specifically allowable if the producer elects to have such credit, exemption, deduction, or adjustment apply. Permits a producer to choose to have such ceiling prices apply instead, and requires that an election so indicating be filed with the Commission within a specified time limit. States that the ceiling price for stripper well natural gas shall be $2.09 per million Btu's, beginning May 1978. Provides that for each month following, the ceiling price shall be determined according to a specified formula which takes into account the annual inflation adjustment factor. Defines \"stripper well natural gas\" as natural gas produced from a well which, for a 90 consecutive day period, produced nonassociated natural gas at a rate which did not exceed an average of 60 Mcf per day, when produced at its maximum efficient rate of flow and in accordance with recognized conservation practices. Directs the Commission to provide, by rule, that stripper wells retain their stripper well status even if production is increased to an average above 60 Mcf per day, if such increase is due to the application of recognized recovery techniques. Sets ceiling prices for any natural gas not covered by the categories specified in this Act, including: (1) natural gas produced from any new well not otherwise qualifying for a higher ceiling price; (2) natural gas committed or dedicated to interstate commerce for which a just and reasonable rate was not in effect under the Natural Gas Act; (3) natural gas which was not committed or dedicated to interstate commerce and which was not subject to an existing contract; and (4) natural gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska and transported through the transportation system approved under the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976. States that such ceiling price shall be $1.45 per million Btu's beginning April 1977, and shall be increased monthly be multiplying the previous month's ceiling price by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation adjustment factor. Authorizes the Commission to increase such ceiling prices if such increased prices are just and reasonable. Provides that prices for first sales of natural gas may exceed the applicable ceiling prices to the extent necessary to recover (1) State severance tax attributable to the production of such natural gas and borne by the seller, and (2) certain production-related costs borne by the seller and allowed by the Commission. Eliminates price controls, effective January 1, 1985, for: (1) new natural gas; (2) certain natural gas produced from new, onshore production wells producing from a completion location deeper than 5,000 feet; and (3) certain natural gas sold under an existing contract, any successor to an existing contract, or any rollover contract. Eliminates price control for certain high-cost natural gas on the effective date of the incremental pricing rule. Eliminate price controls, effective July 1, 1987, for certain natural gas produced from new, onshore production wells producing from a completion depth of 5,000 feet or less. Authorizes the President and the Congress to reimpose price controls on all categories of natural gas subject to deregulation on January 1, 1985. Stipulates that such reimposition of price controls may not take effect earlier than July 1, 1985, nor later than June 30, 1987, and shall remain in effect for a single 18 month period. Sets maximum lawful prices for such period. Directs the Department of Energy to report to the President and the Congress, by July 1, 1984, and by January 1, 1985, on natural gas prices, supplies, and demand, and the competitive conditions and market forces in the natural gas industry in the United States. Requires that such report include an evaluation of whether an equilibrium exists between supply and demand of natural gas. Directs the Department to provide an opportunity for public comment on such reports. =Title II: Incremental Pricing= - Directs the Commission to prescribe and make effective a rule, within 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, designed to provide that natural gas acquisition costs subject to incremental pricing passthrough are passed through to any industrial boiler fuel facility which uses natural gas as a boiler fuel. Requires the Commission to prescribe an amendment to such rule, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, designed to provide that natural gas acquisition costs subject to incremental pricing passthrough are passed through to other industrial facilities using natural gas. Provides that such amendment shall take effect only if not disapproved by either House of the Congress within 30 calendar days of continuous session after it has been submitted. Sets forth costs subject to such passthrough requirements for: (1) new natural gas; (2) natural gas under intrastate rollover contracts; (3) new, onshore production well gas; (4) liquefied natural gas imports; (5) natural gas imports (other than liquefied natural gas); (6) stripper well natural gas; (7) high-cost natural gas; (8) natural gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska and transported through the natural gas transportation system approved under the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976; (9) any increase in the aquisition cost of natural gas attributable to any increase in the amount of State severance taxes or other similar production taxes above levels enacted on or before December 1, 1977; (10) certain natural gas sales authorized by the Commission; and (11) surcharges paid by any interstate pipeline for natural gas acquired from another interstate pipeline. Provides that in cases where natural gas qualifies for two or more categories, the Commission shall prescribe the method for determining which sale price applies, based upon the classification of such natural gas for purposes of pricing under Title I of this Act. Requires each interstate pipeline serving any industrial user of natural gas which is subject to such incremental pricing requirements to establish and maintain an incremental pricing account. Provides that costs subject to such passthrough requirements are to be credited to the account of such pipeline, and passed through by means of a surchange on volumes of natural gas delivered, directly or indirectly, to incrementally priced industrial facilities for ultimate industrial use. States that such surcharge shall be based upon the dollar amount in such pipeline's account and the pipeline's total volume of natural gas delivered directly or indirectly to incrementally priced industrial facilities. Provides that such surcharge may be reduced if an unadjusted surcharge would result in rates and charges paid by any incrementally priced industrial facility that would exceed the appropriate alternative fuel cost, as determined by the Commission on a regional basis. Provides for methods by which the interstate pipeline involved may recover from certain incrementally priced industrial facilities the dollar amount which would have been so passed through if such reduction or elimination had not occurred. States that amounts passed through by any interstate pipeline by means of such surcharges shall be deducted from such pipeline's account. Provides that in cases where the price paid by all incrementally priced users served by a local distribution company equals the alternative fuel price, the local distribution company shall receive only that portion of its pipeline's account necessary to maintain those users at the alternative fuel price. Requires any surcharge paid by any local distribution company to be directly passed through to the incrementally priced industrial facilities it serves. Prohibits States from modifying or otherwise changing the method of allocating costs to the rates and charges of such local distribution companies in a manner that would have the effect of creating any offset for the surcharges required to be paid due to the operation of this Act. Directs the Commission, within 18 months of the date of enactment of this Act, to prescribe and make effective rules providing exemptions from such incremental pricing rules for certain small industrial boiler fuel facilities and for agricultural facilities using natural gas. Provides interim exemptions until the effective date of such permanent exemptions. Exempts: (1) schools, hospitals and similar institutions; (2) the generation of electricity by any electric utility, and (3) to the extent provided by the Commission, any qualifying cogenerator (as defined by the Federal Power Act, as amended by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978), from such incremental pricing rules. Authorizes the Commission, subject to Congressional review, to provide for the exemption, in whole or in part, of any other incrementally priced industrial facility or category thereof from such incremental pricing rules. Exempts from such incremental pricing rules certain liquid natural gas imports, and other natural gas imports if the volume of such other imports does not exceed the volume of natural gas imported into the United States during calendar year 1977. Requires rolled in pricing for any portion of the first sale acquisition cost which is not required to be incrementally priced, and transportation costs, for gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska and transported through the natural gas transportation system approved under the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976. =Title III: Additional Authorities and Requirements= - Authorizes the President to declare a natural gas supply emergency or extend a previously declared emergency if he finds that (1) a severe natural gas shortage exists or is imminent in the United States, and (2) the exercise of emergency purchase authority and emergency allocation authority is reasonably necessary, having exhausted other alternatives to the maximum extent practicable, to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses. Terminates such natural gas emergency declaration or extension (1) on the date on which the President finds that such shortage does not exist, or is not imminent, or (2) 120 days after the date of such declaration of extension. Permits the President, during any such emergency, to authorize any interstate pipeline, or local distribution company served by any interstate pipeline, to contract for emergency supplies of natural gas. Provides that such contract may be with any producer of natural gas if such gas is not produced from the Outer Continental Shelf, and if it is not subject to a certificate under the Natural Gas Act; or with any intrastate pipeline, local distribution company, or other person (other than an interstate pipeline). Limits the duration of such contract to four months, but permits the President to authorize renewals. Authorizes the President to require any pipeline to transport such natural gas and to construct and operate such facilities for the transportation of natural gas as may be necessary to carry out such contracts. Requires the purchasing party to pay the costs of such required contruction. Directs the Commission to require the purchaser to maintain and make available records concerning emergency gas purchases. Authorizes the President to allocate supplies of natural gas to: (1) any interstate pipeline; (2) any local distribution company served by an interstate pipeline which is providing natural gas for only high-priority uses and which is in need of deliveries of natural gas to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas; and (3) any person for meeting requirements of high-priority uses of natural gas.
