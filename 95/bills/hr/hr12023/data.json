Title I: State Water Resources Research Institutes - Authorizes funds to allow the Secretary of the Interior to assist participating States in the establishment of water resources research institutes. Permits the governor of each State to designate one college or university to be the site of such research center or to cooperate with other States in the establishment of regional research centers. Authorizes sums to be annually awarded by the Secretary for the support of approved research centers. Directs such approved centers to coordinate water resources research within their area and to act as a clearinghouse for research data. Provides a specified amount of matching funds to institutes for high priority projects. Directs the Secretary to designate such projects and provides criteria for such determination. Permits moneys authorized by this Act to be used for printing and publishing of research results and for other administrative costs. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to administer this Act. Requires the Secretary to make an annual determination of each participating State's eligibility for the purpose of making the annual grants authorized by this Act. Title II: Additional Water Resources Research Programs - Authorizes a specified amount to be administered by the Secretary. Permits such funds to be used for grants for water research projects. Permits the Secretary to determine eligibility for such grants. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to seek the continuing advice of Federal, State and local governments to assure the best use of the funds available. Limits the Secretary's authority to programs authorized by this Act. Permits advance payments for initial expenses. Requires that as a condition of funding, all results of research be made available to the general public, except for specified national defense purposes.
