    "text": "Employee Bill of Rights Act - Amends the Congressional findings and policies declared in the National Labor Relations Act. Stipulates that only bargaining representatives who are chosen by secret ballot may be deemed exclusive representatives with whom employers have a duty to bargain collectively. Deems it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to threaten or impose any fine or other economic sanction against any person in the exercise of rights under the National Relations Act. Permits a labor organization, employer, or ten percent of the members of the appropriate bargaining unit to request a referendum regarding a potential or existing strike. Deems it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to call or maintain a strike if a majority of employees voting in such a referendum vote not to strike or if such a referendum is requested before a strike begins and the results have not yet been certified. Provides that if an employer, labor organization, or group of employees, submit a dispute to binding arbitration under an existing collective bargaining agreement, or have agreed to submit, arbitration shall be the exclusive forum and no unfair labor practice proceeding involving the same subject matter may be instituted before the National Labor Relations Board unless determinations of such arbitration are inconsistent with rights granted under the National Labor Relations Act. Permits any number of a religion, body, or sect which has traditionally objected to membership in and financial support of labor organizations to refrain from joining or supporting a union. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to prohibit use of any procedure by which union dues and other assessments are deducted from employees paychecks in soliciting and collecting contributions for a segregated campaign fund."
