    "text": "Government Economy and Spending Reform Act - Title I: Authorizations of New Budget Authority - Terminates all budget authority for Federal programs on specified dates, according to the functional or subfunctional category of each program as set forth in the fiscal year 1977 budget. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress by April 1, 1978 on specified programs with respect to the laws under which such programs are carried on, the amount of new budget authority received by such programs, during the four fiscal years ending before April 1, 1978, and to identify programs for which no outlays have been made during the last two fiscal years ending before April 1, 1978. Prohibits providing new budget authority after the applicable review date set forth in this Act unless the provision of such budget authority is specifically authorized by law or the standing rules of either House of Congress. Title II: Zero Base Program Review - Sets forth a timetable for Congressional zero-base review of new budget authority. Defines \"zero base review\" as an evaluation of a given program to determine the merits of its continuation at a level less than, equal to, or more than its existing level. Requires each congressional committee conducting a zero-based program review to adopt tentative and final review plans, receive reports from the Comptroller General and Federal agencies on the program being reviewed, and report to their respective House the results of such review of the program. Sets forth minimum objectives of inquiry for such reviews. Requires that any committee reporting pursuant to this Act recommend the extent to which any program reviewed should be continued or eliminated. Title III: Continuing Review - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 to require whenever the Comptroller General issues a report which discloses any substantial deficiency in the achievement of the objectives of any Federal program the agency conducting such program to report to specified congressional committees 60 days after such report and every six months thereafter to delineate the actions taken with respect to such deficiency. Requires that such agency continue to issue such reports until such time as the Comptroller General determines that no purpose is served by their submission. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, to require the inclusion in the Budget of a statement of the specific objectives of each Government program, and a comparison, in each subsequent Budget, of the achievement of such objectives for the last completed fiscal year with the planned objectives of such year. Title IV: Citizens Bicentennial Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government - Establishes the Citizens' Bicentennial Commission on the Organization and Operation of Government, an independent agency of 18 members to study Federal agencies. Directs the Commission to make recommendations to the President and Congress for the restructuring of such agencies to improve their efficiency. Requires the Commission to submit its final report by September 30, 1980, and terminate it 90 days thereafter. Authorizes to be appropriated without fiscal years limitation $12,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Title. Title V: Zero Base Review of Tax Expenditures - Requires the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation to determine and recommend termination dates for all tax expenditure provisions, defined as any special exclusion, exemption, deduction from gross income, special credit, preferential tax rate or deferral of tax liability. Requires such date to be on December 31, of one to the five year beginning with 1980. Requires that a subsequent zero-base review be conducted every five years after the first such review of such tax expenditure provision. Requires that a bill be passed by the 95th Congress setting the first termination dates for such provisions. Makes any proposal to consider any bill in either House which contains a tax expenditure provision out of order unless such expenditure has a termination date and has been subjected to zero-base review as provided for by this Act. Sets both procedures and time deadlines for conducting zero-base review of tax expenditure provisions. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Requires the Director of Management and Budget to study the feasibility of zero-base budgeting for Federal agencies. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to study the feasibility of personnel ceilings on employees of the United States and their relationships to alternative methods of carrying out the activities of such employees. Requires that such reports be submitted to Congress. Requires Federal agency heads to report requests for new budget authority to Congress. Requires specified committees to study the effectiveness of the zero-base review procedure required by this Act."
