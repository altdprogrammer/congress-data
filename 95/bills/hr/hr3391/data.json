Authorizes the establishment of such an area in connection with dredging for such a project where the Chief of Engineers finds that: (1) the environmental, economic, and social benefits of the area justify increased cost; (2) the cost will not exceed $300,000, and (3) the area to be established will not be substantially altered by natural or man-made causes. Requires certain reports by the Secretary of the Army to the Congress regarding water resources development projects to include consideration of wetland areas."
