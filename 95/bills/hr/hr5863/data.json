Terminates such Advisory Committee upon its submission of its findings and recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture and to the appropriate committees of Congress. Directs that oral auction be used for the competitive sale of national forest timber to the maximum extent consistent with historic patterns of bidding. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor and review all sales from individual national forests and to report to the Justice Department all patterns of bidding which may be collusive."
