    "text": "Wheat and Wheat Foods Research and Nutrition Education Act - States that the purpose of this Act is to authorize and enable the creation of an orderly procedure, adequately financed through an assessment and voluntary contributions, for the development and initiation of an effective and continuous coordinated program of research and nutrition education designed to improve and enhance the quality and make the most efficient use of American wheat, processed wheat, and wheat end products to insure an adequate diet for all Americans. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue orders to effectuate the declared purpose of this Act. States that such orders shall include provisions: (1) for establishing projects for research and nutrition education for wheat and wheat products; (2) for establishing and carrying on research or studies with respect to the sale, distribution, marketing, and utilization of wheat and wheat products and the creation of new products; and (3) requiring that processors, distributors of processed wheat, and end product manufacturers maintain and make available for inspection such books and records as may be required by an order issued pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue orders providing for the establishment of a Wheat Industry Council to: (1) administer and make rules and regulations to effectuate orders issued pursuant to this Act; (2) receive, investigate and report to the Secretary complaints of violations of such orders; and (3) recommend to the Secretary amendments to such orders. States that membership of such Council shall represent wheat producers, processors, end product manufacturers and consumers on an equal basis. Requires each end product manufacturer to pay to such Council an assessment, not to exceed five cents per hundredweight, based on the total number of hundredweights of processed wheat purchased by or transferred to such manufacturer, to be uses for expenditures and expensed incurred by the Council or Secretary under this Act. Exempts from this Act any end product manufacturer who does not purchase more than 2,000 hundredweight of processed wheat per year for use in manufacture. Requires the Secretary to conduct a referendum among end product manufacturers to determine whether the issuance of an order under this Act is favored by such manufacturers. States that no such order shall become effective unless: (1) votes were cast by more than 50 percent of the registered end product manufacturers; and (2) not less than two-thirds of such voting manufacturers approve of such order or by a majority of such manufacturers if such majority manufactured not less than two-thirds of the total processed wheat contained in all end products manufactured by those voting in referendum. Allows end product manufacturers who have reserved the right to seek refunds and who disfavor the programs under this Act to receive from the Council the assessment paid to such Council. Sets forth the procedures for the administrative and judicial review of orders or obligations imposed under this Act. States that any person who willfully violates any order issued under this Act or who fails to remit any required assessment or fee shall be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 per violation. Requires the Secretary to conduct a referendum on request by ten percent or more of the end product manufactures to determine whether such manufacturers favor the suspension or termination of any order. States that such order shall be suspended or terminated if more than 50 percent of the voting manufacturers or manufacturers who produce end products containing more than 50 percent of the total processed wheat contained in all end products manufactured by those voting approve of such action. Authorizes the Secretary to make investigations for the effective carrying out of his or her responsibilities under this Act or to determine whether any person has or is about to violate any of the provisions of this Act. Sets forth the eligibility requirements for any organization wishing to: (1) participate in the nominating of Council members; (2) represent wheat producers, processors, end product manufacturers or consumers; and (3) request the issuance of an order under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such funds as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
