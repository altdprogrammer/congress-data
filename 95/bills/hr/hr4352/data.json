    "text": "Foreign Boycotts Act - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to repeal the authority of the President to allocate a portion of export licenses on factors other than exportation history to effectuate the United States policy against foreign boycotts. Declares it the policy of the United States: (1) to oppose foreign restrictive trade practices or boycotts against domestic concerns; and (2) to prohibit participation of domestic concerns in such boycotts. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations which: (1) require a domestic concern requested to participate in such boycott to so notify the Secretary; (2) prohibit furnishing information regarding race, religion, sex, or national origin of a concern's employees or shareholders where such information will effectuate such a boycott; and (3) prohibit refusing to do business with a domestic concern or country friendly to the United States or national thereof pursuant to such restrictive trade practice or boycott. Imposes a civil penalty of $10,000 for violation of this Act. Authorizes any person aggrieved by violation of this Act to bring a civil action for treble damages. Requires reports to the President and Congress under the Export Administration Act of 1969 to describe the impact of such boycotts upon the American economy. Excludes certain provisions of this Act from the termination of the Export Administration Act of 1969."
