    "text": "Solar Energy Bank Act - Creates a Government corporation to be known as the Solar Energy Development Bank to make long-term, low-interest loans to encourage the use of solar energy in commercial and residential structures. Prohibits conflicts of interest on the part of officers or employees of the Bank. Prohibits the Bank or its employees from utilizing the Solar Bank to finance political activities. Imposes criminal penalties for the furnishing of false or misleading information by applicants for loans under this Act. Allows the Solar Bank to make loans directly, or through lending institutions which are entitled to reasonable fees for their services. Sets the annual interest rates on such loans at not more than three percent and limits the loans to a maximum of 30 years duration. Requires that the detailed plans submitted with each loan application include installation, architectural, and design plans and fees, if applicable. Prohibits the approval of loans unless the Solar Bank finds that the proposed equipment and related expenses are appropriate and reasonable and will result in a meaningful reduction in the conventional energy dependence of the user. Requires the Solar Bank to establish guidelines for the distribution of its loans among commercial and residential uses and requires that at least 60 percent of such monies loaned be for residential purposes. Establishes procedures governing the processing and approval of loan applications by the Bank. Provides penalties for the violation of the loan contract or for fraud in the obtaining of such a loan. Exempts the Solar Bank and its assets from taxation, except that the real and tangible personal property of the Bank shall be subject to Federal, State, and local taxation to the same extent as that of private corporations. Directs the General Accounting Office (GAO) to audit the financial transactions of the Bank, and grants the GAO access to all its books, records and accounts. Establishes a Solar Energy Fund in the Treasury of the United States to pay the expenses of the Bank. Authorizes the appropriation of $5,000,000,000 to the fund."
