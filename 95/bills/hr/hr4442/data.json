    "text": "Repeals the Food Stamp Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make payments to each State of the Nation during each of the five fiscal years following enactment of this Act for the purpose of financing a program which is established and maintained by each State to assist in meeting the nutritional needs of its citizens. Specifies a general formula for the allocation of such payments among the States and sets specific conditions for the receipt of such payments. Delineates the procedure by which any State may appeal any adverse determination by the Secretary regarding violation of any such condition, and grants jurisdiction to hear such appeals to the United States courts of appeal and to the Supreme Court of the United States. Establishes in the Department of the Treasury a Nutritional Program Trust Fund from which payments shall be made. Authorizes an aggregate appropriation of $14,000,000,000 for the five years of the program, in amounts diminishing from $4,500,000,000 in the first year to $1 billion in the last."
