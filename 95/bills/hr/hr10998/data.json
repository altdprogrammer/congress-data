Permits the President to dispose of such records only if the President judges them to be of no administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value, if the prior approval of the Archivist of the United States has been obtained and his intent to make such disposal has been published in the Federal Register 60 days prior to such disposal. Requires the Archivist to take custody of Presidential records upon conclusion of a President's term of office. Requires the Archivist to place such records in a Federal depository, the director of which has been appointed after consultation with the former President, or where appropriate, the President's family. Requires all such records to be made available to the public pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act unless they are classified, relate to presidential appointments, their publication would be harmful to the foreign or current affairs of the Government, or would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy of any person. States that all provisions of this Act apply to Vice-Presidential as well as Presidential records."
