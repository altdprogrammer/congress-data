Authorizes such an institution to invest not more than five percent of its assets in, or interest in real property in a geographical area of a neighborhood receiving concentrated development assistance from a local government under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Permits an association whose general reserves, surplus, and undivided profits aggregate a sum in excess of five percent of its withdrawable accounts to invest in obligations of its home State and political subdivisions thereof, if such investment is prudent."
