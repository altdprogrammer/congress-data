    "text": "Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services Amendments - Title I: Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 - Extends through 1983 the authorization of appropriations for grants for basic vocational rehabilitation services under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Provides that State plans for providing rehabilitation services need be submitted only once every three years instead of annually. Changes the requirements with regard to the contents of State plans, including adding the requirements that the plans provide for vocational rehabilitation services to handicapped American Indians and provide for the establishment and maintenance of information and referral programs so that the handicapped will be aware of the various Federal and State programs which could benefit them. Changes procedures for the withholding of State grants for failure of the State plan to comply with Federal requirements or for failure of the administration of the plan to comply with the plan's own requirements. Allows State vocational rehabilitation services to include (1) the use of existing telecommunications systems which have the potential for improving service delivery methods and (2) the use of services providing recorded material for the blind and captioned material for the deaf. Changes the formula for the computation of State allotments for basic vocational services. Extends through fiscal year 1983 the set aside of funds at the Federal level for regional pilot projects for advising individuals of the benefits available to them under the Act. Establishes a new program of grants to the governing bodies of Indian tribes on reservations for demonstration projects under which the tribes shall develop and provide vocational rehabilitation services for handicapped American Indians residing on or near such reservations. Establishes a National Institute of Rehabilitation Research to be responsible for administering existing programs of rehabilitation research and for coordinating Federal programs and policies relating to research and rehabilitation. Directs the Institute to undertake a study of the way in which Federal programs providing benefits to handicapped individuals might be restructured so as to eliminate any disincentives for persons receiving benefits under such programs to obtain employment. Authorizes the Institute to make grants for the conduct of a research program concerning the use of existing telecommunications systems which have the potential for substantially improving delivery methods. Authorizes the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services to make training grants for medical, social and psychological rehabilitation in addition to vocational rehabilitation. Extends through 1981 the Commissioner's authority to make grants for construction of rehabilitation facilities, for projects to provide vocational training services to handicapped individuals, and for special projects and demonstrations. Revises the program of guarantees of loans for construction of rehabilitation facilities. Renames the National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults the Helen Keller Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults. Authorizes the Commissioner to make grants to the States to establish and operate comprehensive rehabilitation centers which shall provide a broad range of specified services to handicapped individuals. Adds to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 a new Title IV \"National Council on the Handicapped,\" which establishes within Health, Education, and Welfare a National Council on the Handicapped. Sets forth the duties of the Council, including developing general policies for the Rehabilitation Services Administration and the National Institute of Rehabilitation Research. Renames the Architectural Transportation Compliance Board the Architectural Transportation and Communication Barriers Compliance Board, and adds nine handicapped individuals to the membership of the Board. Adds to the duties of the Board the duty to investigate and examine alternative approaches to the communication barriers confronting handicapped individuals. Authorizes United States district courts to award a reasonable attorney's fee to a prevailing plantiff in certain actions brought to enforce rights under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide technical assistance to (1) rehabilitation facilities and (2) nonprofits groups for the removal of architectural, transportation and communication barriers. Title II: Employment Opportunities for Projects with Industry - Employment Opportunities for Handicapped Individuals Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish a community service employment program for handicapped individuals with both public and private employers. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to handicapped individuals to enable them to establish and operate their own businesses. Title III: Comprehensive Services for Independent Living - Adds a new title VII to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \"Comprehensive Services for Independent Living.\" Authorizes, under such Title, the Commissioner to make grants (supplementary to grants under Title I of the Act) to assist States in providing independent living services designed to meet the needs of individuals whose disabilities are so severe that they do not presently have the potential for gainful employment but may benefit from vocational rehabilitation services which will enable them to live and function independently. Title IV: Interagency Programs - Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants and contracts for the purpose of research and demonstration projects specifically designed to address the multiple and interrelated service needs of handicapped individuals, the elderly, and children, youths, adults, and families in need of protective services. Requires the submission of a report to Congress on such projects within four months of completion of the project."
