Rept. 95-166) State Veterans' Home Assistance Improvement Act - Expands the program of making grants to States for the construction, remodeling or renovation of State veterans' care facilities to include hospital and domiciliary as well as nursing home care facilities. Authorizes the appropriation of $15,000,000 for fiscal years 1978 and 1979 and states that such sums shall remain available until expended. Expands, to include domiciliary and hospital facilities, the scope of the requirement that no more than a fixed percentage of the resident population of a grant-assisted State nursing home may consist of persons receiving care as veterans. Raises the allowable non-veteran population. Revises the procedures governing applications for grant assistance and the approval or denial of grant applications. Limits the total amount any one State may receive in any given fiscal year under this program. Repeals the authorization provisions of the existing program."
