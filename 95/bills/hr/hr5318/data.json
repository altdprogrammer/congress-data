    "text": "Consumer Actions Act - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to allow any person, partnership, or corporation injured by any unfair or deceptive trade practice to commence a civil action for relief on behalf of himself or on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated. Allows the suit to be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction. Gives the United States district courts original jurisdiction of any matter if the amount in controversy is expected to exceed $25,000. Requires a person, partnership, or corporation to notify the Federal Trade Commission when commencing such an action. Prohibits the imposition of any exemplary or punitive damages as the result of such actions. Sets forth the methods which may be used to give notice of any action commenced to the members of any class of plaintiffs involved in the action. Requires the plaintiff to pay the cost of giving notice unless the court orders the defendant to pay the cost. Entitles prevailing plaintiffs to recover the costs of the action. Allows any person, partnership, or corporation aggrieved by any deceptive trade practice with respect to which the Commission has issued a final cease and desist order to commence an action for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction."
