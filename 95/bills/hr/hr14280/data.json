Defines \"concealable handgun\" to mean any handgun which is manufactured, assembled, produced, or imported after the date of enactment, and which fails to meet the specified minimum requirements for handguns. Modifies existing firearms provisions to prohibit certain activities involving concealable handguns or handguns. Prohibits the manufacture, assembly, or production of a concealable handgun except as the Secretary of the Treasury may authorize. Prohibits any person who is licensed to import, manufacture, or deal in firearms or ammunition from selling, delivering, or otherwise transferring a concealable handgun. Makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to import any handgun part into the United States, or to receive any such part which has been imported into the United States, for use in the manufacture or assembly of concealable handguns."
