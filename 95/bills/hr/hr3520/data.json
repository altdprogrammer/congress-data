Sets forth requirements for applicants of grants under this Act, including the requirement that all test results, medical records, and other information regarding treatment of any person treated in connection with a project assisted under this Act shall be kept confidential, unless such person consents to the release of such information. Requires the Secretary to annually prepare and submit to the President for transmittal to Congress a comprehensive report on the administration of this Act."
