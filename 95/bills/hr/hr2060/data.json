Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish additional mine safety standards pursuant to recommendations made by an advisory committee appointed by the Secretary. Requires that standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents allow miners and their representatives the opportunity for observation of monitoring techniques and access to pertinent records. Requires that standards impose labeling requirements and suitable protective equipment for miners. Establishes procedures for the granting of variances for affected mine operators from such standards. Authorizes inspections of mine sites by representatives of the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requires special inspections upon the request of miners or their representatives where an imminent danger is alleged to exist. Requires investigations into mine accidents with a view to preventing their recurrence. Imposes reporting requirements on mine operators with respect to work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses. Stipulates that such information shall be obtained in a manner designed to impose a minimum burden on small business. Establishes a program of miner education and training. Requires that miners be informed of rights and obligations under this Act. Establishes procedures for enforcement of mine safety standards under this Act, including the closure of dangerous mine sites by the Secretary of Labor or his representative. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for violation of provisions of this Act. Establishes the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health Commission, as an independent agency, to appoint hearing examiners (to adjudicate disputes under the Act) and to review the decisions of such examiners. Establishes, in the Department of Labor, an Office of the Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health to be filled by Presidential appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Creates the Advisory Committee on Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety and Health, to consult with the Assistant Secretary and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on the administration of the Act. Establishes procedures for congressional review and disapproval of regulations promulgated under this Act. Transfers the administration of the Act from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Labor. Authorizes the transfer of personnel to the Department of Labor. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. Requires disclosure of known financial interests in mines and mine operators of employees or officials engaged in the administration of this Act, subject to criminal penalties."
