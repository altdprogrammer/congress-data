Authorizes the Board to promulgate rules establishing minimum qualification criteria for travel agents. Requires the Board to report annually to Congress regarding its activities. Prohibits any individual from engaging in the business of conducting a travel agency after December 31,1977, unless such individual has received a travel agent registration certificate from the Board. Stipulates that such certificates shall expire on the second anniversary of the date of issuance. Stipulates that such certificates shall not be assignable or transferable. Authorizes the renewal of certificates upon payment of a renewal fee and a showing that the applicant meets the minimum qualifications established by the Board. Authorizes the Board to suspend or revoke travel agent registration certificates, after a hearing, if the Board determines that the individual has ceased to satisfy the minimum qualifications promulgated by the Board or has engaged in specified practices. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to the Department of Transportation to carry out the provisions of this Act."
