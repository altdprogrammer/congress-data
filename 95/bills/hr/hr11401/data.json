Rept. 95-1509) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research and development programs, construction of facilities, and research and program management. Authorizes the use of appropriations for \"Research and development\" for: (1) items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts; and (2) grants to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Prohibits such funds to be used for construction of a facility, including collateral equipment, the cost of which exceeds $250,000. Provides that: amounts appropriated for \"Research and development\" or for \"Construction of facilities\" shall remain available without fiscal year limitation; and specified contracts entered into under \"Research and program management\" shall be for periods not in excess of 12 months beginning at any time during the fiscal year. Sets forth limitations on: (1) the use of appropriated funds for scientific consultation or extraordinary expenses, for construction of new facilities and additions to existing facilities, and for unforeseen programmatic needs; and (2) the transfer of funds from one appropriation to another. Stipulates that such funds shall not be obligated until: (1) a period of 30 days has passed after the Administrator or his designee has transmitted to the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate and specified committees of Congress a report on the proposed action; and (2) each such committee has notified the Administrator that there is no objection to the proposed action before the 30 day period expires. Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to explore ways and means of geographically distributing its research and development funds. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to direct NASA to assist in bioengineering research, development, and demonstration programs designed to alleviate and minimize the effects of disabilities of handicapped individuals. Requires the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to report to the appropriate Committees of Congress by December 31, 1978, on the policy regarding conflicts of interest, standards of conduct, and financial disclosure."
