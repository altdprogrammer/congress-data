    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Uniform Motor Vehicle Insurance Act - Prohibits the registration or knowing operation or use of any motor vehicle upon public roads unless such vehicle is insured under a policy of insurance meeting the requirements of this Act. Requires that insurance policies include provisions that the insurer shall pay, without regard to fault, to any person an amount equal to the net economic loss sustained by such person arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle. Enumerates those conditions which shall make an operator of an insured vehicle liable to the insurer for benefits payable to others. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to categorize all motor vehicles larger than ordinary passenger cars for the purpose of assigning percentages of responsibility for claims arising from economic losses to occupants of all other vehicles involved. Makes the owner, operator or user of an insured motor vehicle liable for damages for catastrophic harm arising out of the negligent use of such vehicle to the extent that such damages exceed economic loss, but that the insurer shall make available optional insurance therefor. Stipulates that an application for insurance shall not be rejected, nor shall a policy be cancelled, except for suspension or revocation of the license of the owner or principal operator to operate a motor vehicle, or for failure to pay the premium thereon. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, after consultation with insurers and State insurance authorities, to promulgate a common uniform statistical plan for the allocation and compilation of claims and loss experience data. Authorizes the Secretary to require standard uniform and standard minimal policy provisions and classes of risk and rating territories for coverage under this Act. Requires the Secretary to organize an assigned claims bureau and assigned claims plan in each State to be maintained by the insurers who must participate in every State where they offer insurance. Specifies that all injured persons may obtain benefits through the assigned claims bureau and assigned claims plan in their State of residence if no such benefits are applicable to the injury or death, or no such benefits can be identified, or the identifiable benefits are, because of financial inability of one or more insurers to fulfill their obligations, inadequate to provide such benefits."
