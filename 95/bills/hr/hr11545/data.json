    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #907 (289-66)) Meat Import Act - Limits the maximum aggregate quantity of specified meat articles which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouses, for consumption in the customs territory of the United States in any calendar year after 1978 to $1,204,600,000 pounds, adjustable according to a specified formula. Excludes from the domestic commercial production factor in such formula the carcass weight of live cattle specified in certain Tariff Schedules. Requires a further adjustment of such annual aggregate quantity by multiplying it by a ratio of: (1) the average annual per capita production of domestic cow beef during a calendar year (as estimated) and the four preceding calendar years; (2) to the average annual per capita production of domestic cow beef in the calendar year (as estimated) and the preceding calendar year. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, for each calendar year after 1978, to estimate and publish the aggregate quantity of meat articles prescribed for such year as well as the quantity that would be entered into the United States but for the limitations. Directs the President to limit by proclamation the total quantity of meat articles entered into the United States, whenever such quantity equals or exceeds 110 percent of the Secretary's estimate; but prohibits any limitation below 1,200,000,000 pounds. Requires the termination of any limitation as of the first day of a calendar quarter, under most circumstances, if before such quarter the aggregate quantity is less than 110 percent of the Secretary's estimate. Authorizes the President to: (1) increase the total quantity of meat articles which may be entered during any calendar year after 1978 by ten percent if the average index ratio for the first two calendar quarters of such year is 1.1 or higher; or (2) decrease the total quantity by ten percent if the average index ratio for the first two quarters is .9 percent or lower. Defines the index ratio as the number obtained by dividing the Department of Agriculture Farm Price of Cattle Index for the calendar quarter by the Department of Labor Beef and Veal Price Index for such quarter. Permits the President to suspend any proclamation or increase any amount proclaimed as required by the preceding provision if: (1) required during a period of declared national emergency or (2) supplies are inadequate because of a natural disaster to meet demand at reasonable prices. Prohibits such suspension or increase from extending beyond the termination of the national emergency. Requires the Secretary to allocate the entry quota of meat articles proclaimed by the President among supplying countries on the basis of their respective shares of the United States market for meat articles during the representative period. Directs the Secretary to study the regional economic impact of imports of meat articles."
