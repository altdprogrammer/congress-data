    "text": "Part-Time Career Opportunity Act - Sets forth a time schedule for the required introduction of part-time jobs in each grade in each Federal agency, at a rate of two percent each year for five years. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to waive or reduce any such percentage minimum for a period not to exceed one year under specified circumstances. Deems such a decision a final agency action for judicial review purposes. Declares the provisions of this Act nonapplicable to situations where a collective-bargaining agreement is in effect which establishes the number of hours of employment in a week. Allows an employee occupying a position on a part-time career employment basis credit for one month for civil service pension purposes for each 173 hours of work performed for which retirement deductions are made or deposits may be made."
