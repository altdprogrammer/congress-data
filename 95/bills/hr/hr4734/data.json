    "text": "Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Reforms - Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to authorize as part of the comprehensive manpower services program payments to profitmaking employers for expanding job opportunities based on net salary paid to low-income persons hired under such Act. Makes public boards of education eligible to become prime sponsors. Declares States having populations over 5,000,000 ineligible to be prime sponsors. Direct the Secretary of Labor to make additional payment to prime sponsors which take action to utilize existing organizations and facilities in carrying out their activities. Directs that persons having particular disadvantages in the labor market be included in prime sponsor planning councils. Revises requirements to prime sponsor comprehensive manpower plans under the comprehensive manpower services program and for applications for assistance under the public service employment programs. Changes review guidelines with respect to comprehensive manpower plans. Imposes specified restrictions relative to the operation of public service employment programs concerning (1) salaries paid administrators hired by eligible applicants, (2) benefits which must be provided to persons in public service jobs, (3) political activities of such persons, and (4) nepotism in public service jobs hiring. Revises conditions applicable to all programs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to among other things (1) maximize employability of participants in the private sector, (2) prohibit hiring of recent State or local government employees, and (3) place a ceiling on supply and equipment costs."
