Extends, through September 30, l978, temporary provisions of existing law under which (1) Supplemental Security Income recipients in all States except California and Massachusetts are eligible for food stamps, and (2) Federal matching funds are available for child support services for nonwelfare families. Extends, until April l, l978, the deadline for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare report to Congress on the appropriateness of child care standards mandated in Title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act. Bars, until October l, l977, any reduction in State Medicaid matching funds that might otherwise occur due to a lack of State evaluations of patients in skilled nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and mental hospitals."
