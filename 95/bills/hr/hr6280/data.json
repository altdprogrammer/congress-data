Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to extend counselling and technical assistance with respect to property maintenance and other matters to owners of single family dwelling units. Amends the National Housing Act to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to insure pursuant to a co-insurance contract providing that the mortgage will assume at least a specified minimum percent of any losses and will carry out appraisal and inspection as the Secretary shall approve. Limits mortgage insurance to individuals whose mortgage payments do not exceed 28 percent of the monthly income of the mortgages and his or her spouse. Increases, from three to ten percent the amount required to be paid by a mortgagor on a residence before the mortgage is eligible for insurance under specified programs."
