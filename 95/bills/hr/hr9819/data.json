    "date": "1977-10-28", 
    "text": "Shipping Act Amendments - Amends the Shipping Act, 1916, to set forth procedures for investigations by the Federal Maritime Commission of violations of such Act with respect to rates and tariffs of common carriers by water in foreign commerce. Sets forth time limitations during which the Commission shall issue final orders with respect to such investigative proceedings. Stipulates that carriers which fail to comply with depositions, written interrogatories, discovery procedures or subpoenas pursuant to such an investigation shall not be allowed to enter United States' ports. Sets forth civil penalties for continuing service to United States' ports. Stipulates that such a failure to comply will create a rebuttable presumption that the facts alleged in the complaint or Commission's order of investigation regarding such a violation are established for purposes of the proceeding. Directs the Secretary of State to negotiate a regime of cooperation with other maritime nations to secure foreign compliance with the Commission's requirements for information. Directs the Commission to disapprove contracts between water carriers who are members of the same conference unless each carrier retains the right of independent action on not more than 30 days notice to the conference. Increases the penalties for violations of specified prohibitions under such Act. Directs the Commission to promulgate rules requiring water carriers in foreign commerce to periodically certify that tariff rates are collected without rebates and that the carrier is conforming to its tariff schedules and is not engaging in discriminatory acts. Directs the Commission to promulgate regulations requiring shippers and consignees to certify that they are the filed tariff without rebate."
