    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1978-08-17", 
    "text": "Criminal Justice Improvements Act - Title I: Revision of Title 18 - Repeals by not reenacting certain offenses, including the capturing or killing of carrier pigeons, building vessels for slave trade purposes, selling intoxicants to Indians, and advocating overthrow of the Federal or State government. Incorporates into Title 18 certain offenses which are located in other United States Code sections, including aircraft piracy, assaulting certain Federal government officers or employees, and interference with the exercise of certain rights in the buying, selling, and renting of housing. Consolidates chapters which contain similar subject matter. Repeals by not reenacting certain procedural provisions, and excludes procedural provisions which are cross-referenced to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Modifies the language of three offenses dealing with abortion to read \"illegal abortion.\" Revises the maximum authorized terms of imprisonment for 14 offenses, including conspiracy to defraud the government with respect to claims (from ten years to five years), the transportation of slaves (from five years to ten years), and destruction of a vessel by the owner (from life to ten years). Specifies a uniform fine structure in which the maximum fines are related to the maximum authorized terms of imprisonment. Authorizes imposition of a fine upon any person found guilty of an offense. Directs the court to consider the defendants' financial status when deciding whether to impose a fine and its amount. Directs the Judicial Conference of the United States to analyze on a continuing basis data relating to sentencing in the Federal courts. Requires the Conference to develop, make available, and evaluate advisory sentencing guidelines. Requires the court, in determining a particular sentence, to consider specific factors, including: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to provide punishment commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, to deter similar conduct, protect the public, or provide the defendant needed training; (3) effective alternatives to imprisonment; and (4) any applicable advisory sentencing guidelines. Allows a defendant who has been convicted to be sentenced to a term of probation and specifies limitations. Increases from six months to one year the length of time a person can be confined while on probation. Requires probation officers to provide to the court information which is necessary to evaluate sentencing alternatives and information concerning advisory guidelines. Directs officers to conduct pre-release or pre-parole investigations. Decreases from six months to 90 days the minimum sentence for which good time allowance may be deducted. Applies restrictions on release prior to trial to offenses punishable by life imprisonment. Eliminates and modifies certain corrections provisions. Requires requests from specified sources to the court for the use of juvenile records to be in writing. Title II: Technical and Conforming Provisions - Conforms the fine levels of criminal statutes in other titles of the United States Code (except the Internal Revenue Code) to those of Title 18. Sets January 1, 1980, as the effective date of this Act."
