    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-02-01", 
    "text": "Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act - Requires the Civil Service Commission to establish a master plan containing guidelines and criteria by which it shall evaluate experiments conducted by Federal agencies to test the impact of varied work schedules on efficiency, mass transit, energy consumption, service to the public, and increased opportunities for full-time and part-time employment. Title I: Flexible Scheduling of Work Hours - Requires that the experimental testing of flexible work schedules include designated periods of required presence of employees and designated periods during which employees may choose arrival and departure times or accumulation of credit hours. Permits an agency head, upon a determination that the agency's functions are being handicapped or its costs are increasing, to restrict choice of arrival and departure time or credit hours, or to exclude any employees. Prescribes the method of computation of overtime under such a schedule, granting employees a choice of compensatory time in lieu of overtime. Limits premium pay for night-work under such a schedule. Requires payment to employees prevented from working on holidays because of such schedule. Permits use of time clocks under such experiments. Prohibits carryover of more than ten credit hours from one biweekly period to the next. Title: Four-Day Week and Other Compressed Work Schedules - Permits agencies to conduct three-year experiments with four-day workweeks or other compressed schedules. Permits exceptions for employees who would incur personal hardships under such schedules. Exempts the hours of compressed schedules from provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act relating to premium pay for overtime work. Allows overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the hours of such compressed schedules. Title III: Administrative Provisions - Includes employees in labor organizations in experiments under this Act only to the extent provided in an agreement between such organizations and the agencies involved. Prohibits threats or coercion by fellow employees against employees not represented in labor organizations regarding the choice of work hours and credit hours. Requires an interim and a final report by the Commission to the Congress on results of and recommendations relating to the experiments conducted under this Act."
