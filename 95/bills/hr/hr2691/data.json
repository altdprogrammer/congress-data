Limits the credit taken to $80,000. Limits the number of employees for whom credit may be taken to ten new employees, or the maximum number of employees paid by the taxpayer during the calendar quarter ending the previous June 30th, whichever number is less. Directs the Secretary to submit reports to Congress, in 1978 and 1980 assessing the impact of this credit."
