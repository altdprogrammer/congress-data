Confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear and decide any claims presented by the Wichita Indian Tribe of Oklahoma against the United States, with respect to lands allegedly taken from that tribe without adequate compensation. Declares that any previous award made by the Indian Claims Commission with respect to such lands shall have no effect on a claim filed under this Act."
