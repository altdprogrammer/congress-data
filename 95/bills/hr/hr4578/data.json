    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-03-07", 
    "text": "Requires each airport authority of an airport at which more than 10,000 aircraft operations occurred during 1977 to complete a Noise Exposure Forecast Study by June 30, 1978, and to submit the results of such study to each political subdivision which is within the \"impact area\" of such airport as defined in this Act and to specified Federal and State agencies. Requires that such study be repeated at least once every five years. Stipulates that each such airport shall be regulated by a Community Airport Noise Impact Board, except airports operated by the Federal Government for national defense purposes. Sets forth procedures for the selection of the membership of such Boards and the certification of such Boards by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Stipulates that each Noise Impact Board shall promulgate rules and regulations regarding: (1) the times during which takeoffs and landings may be made; (2) takeoff and landing procedures; (3) jet and propellor use not necessary to flight; (4) allocation of runway use; and (5) the types and numbers of aircraft permitted to use the airport with or without conditions. Requires an airport authority to file with the Noise Impact Board a complete description of any proposed runway construction which will modify the existing \"impact area\" or increase operations at the airport, or of any proposed additional flights or the commencement of operations by an air carrier not currently using such airport. Directs the Board to approve, modify, or disapprove such proposed changes within 60 days. Sets forth review procedures of rules, regulations or decisions handed down by a Noise Impact Board by the Federal Aviation Administration or the Civil Aeronautics Board. Stipulates that such a rule, regulation, or decision may only be overturned upon a finding that it has a substantial adverse effect on air traffic safety or on the commercial viability of the airport or of an aircarrier, and is not justified by its beneficial effect upon the noise environment surrounding the airport. Stipulates that the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay the administrative and operating expenses of each Noise Impact Board in an amount up to $75,000 per year from funds in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Stipulates that Board members shall be compensated only by the political subdivision they represent. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violation of rules, regulations, or decisions promulgated by a Noise Impact Board."
