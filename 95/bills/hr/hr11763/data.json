    "date": "1978-03-22", 
    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to study the costs of diseases which are environmentally related. Defines such diseases as those which may result in whole or in part from exposure to contaminants at work, at home, indoors, or in the ambient environment. Defines costs of such diseases to be both direct and indirect costs, including costs of prevention, treatment, convalescence, rehabilitation, and costs stemming from loss of income due to incapacitation. Extends the authorization of appropriations under such Act through fiscal year 1981: (1) for health service research, evaluation, and demonstration activities; and (2) for health statistical activities. Amends the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 to require the Task Force on Environmental Cancer and Heart and Lung Disease to conduct a study to identify the extent to which indoor and outdoor environmental activities may cause cancer, heart, or lung diseases. Requires the Secretary, acting through the National Center for Health Statistics, to promulgate guidelines for the collection and distribution of information necessary to determine the effects of conditions of employment and indoor and outdoor environmental conditions on public health. Requires related Federal and Executive agencies to cooperate in compiling such information."
