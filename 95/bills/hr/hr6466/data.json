    "text": "Amends the Internal Security Act of 1950 by adding Title II: Terrorism. Prohibits issuance of a visa, admittance to the United States, or granting of United States citizenship to: (1) any person who has been convicted in the United States or elsewhere of any crime of terrorism; (2) any person not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who, while outside of the United States, advocated orally or in writing any crime of terrorism; or (3) any person who has engaged in terrorist activities. Makes it unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to: (1) send or receive funds, arms, explosives or any other thing of value for the purpose of committing any crime of terrorism; or (2) knowingly possess, transport, receive, or dispose of, funds or anything of value coerced or induced by any crime of terrorism. Defines the term \"crime of terrorism\" as espionage, sabotage, kidnapping, extortion, skyjacking, robbery, bombing, holding a person prisoner or hostage or any threat of any of the above. Provides for a fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both for persons violating the provisions of this Act. Penalizes persons convicted of a crime of terrorism which resulted in the death of a hostage with imprisonment for life without parole, time off for good behavior or any pardon or mitigation of the sentence. Grants the United States a civil right of action to impose a constructive trust upon all property acquired by violation of any Federal criminal statute unless such property is found to have been acquired by a purchaser in good faith. Directs that the action be brought by the Department of Justice. Sets forth regulations and procedures for the constructive conduct of such civil action. Provides that all property recovered under this Act which is free of equitable claims shall inure to the use of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration."
