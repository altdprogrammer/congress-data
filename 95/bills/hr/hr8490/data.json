Extends to December 31, 1977, the deadline for organizations which have received credit or refunds for social security taxes paid to file certificates providing such coverage. Forgives any retroactive liability of organizations which have not received refunds or credits for unpaid social security coverage for October 1976, through June 1977, absent a contrary election by individual employees. Provides for the payment of retroactive liabilities in installments rather than lump sums, under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury."
