Directs the Secretary to develop guidelines for annual assistance applications from States and to invite Governors to submit initial applications. Specifies the requirements of such applications, including assurances that one-half of Federal assistance will be utilized for conservation programs and the State will coordinate its energy-related planning with local governments and Indian tribes. Requires States seeking assistance to have an energy plan approved by the Secretary. Enumerates the contents of such plans, including descriptions and projections of energy supply and demand in the State, and management and emergency plans. Sets forth mandatory programs and measures required of States receiving financial assistance, including: (1) energy conservation standards for new buildings; and (2) an energy extension service to disseminate information, provide energy evaluations, and utilize State outreach delivery programs. Describes restrictions on the use of funds provided under this Act. Provides for the allocation of funds by the Secretary among States. Details the processes for administration of applications and recordkeeping and reporting. Directs the Secretary to include in the annual report required by the Department of Energy Organization Act, a report on actions taken under this Act. Abolishes the Energy Extension Service established in the Energy Research and Development Administration under the National Energy Extension Service Act and vests extension service duties in State energy extension service programs. Makes conforming amendments to provisions of the Energy Conservation and Production Act and the National Energy Act. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize the Secretary to provide financial assistance to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for development of innovative and creative special energy projects. Authorizes $5,000,000 to be appropriated for these purposes for fiscal years 1979 to 1983, to remain available until expended."
