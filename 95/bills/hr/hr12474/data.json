Allows taxpayers a business income tax deduction for contributions to such trusts only to the extent they do not exceed the reasonable costs of product liability insurance for the taxpayer. Imposes excise taxes on self-dealing and excess contribution by persons who contribute, control, own, or have beneficial interests in the trusts. Includes distribution from these trusts in the taxpayers' gross income when made for an unqualified purpose, and imposes a ten percent tax on the trusts for such expenditures."
