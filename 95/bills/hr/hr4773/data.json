    "text": "Amends the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act to raise the maximum license fee for commission merchants, dealers and brokers from $100 to $150, and to raise from $100,000 to $200,000 the minimum invoice value of specified goods any person must buy or sell or negotiate the sale of in order to be deemed a dealer or broker. Includes as a \"dealer\" any person who buys potatoes for canning and/or processing. Allows the Secretary of Agriculture, upon request, to withhold from public disclosure the name, address and other identifying information about any person who has filed an unfair conduct complaint against any commission merchant, dealer or broker, if the Secretary determines that such disclosure would adversely affect the interest of the complainant and is not required by the public interest. Directs the Secretary to inspect at least once every six months for a period of two years the accounts, records and memorandums of any commission merchant, dealer or broker who has violated the provision of such Act requiring prompt full payment in respect of any transaction in any perishable agricultural commodity. Permits the Secretary to require surety bonds as assurance of payment of reparation awards from such merchants, dealers and brokers for the two year period following determination of such violation."
