    "text": "Highway Safety Act - Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts to carry out various highway safety programs. Authorizes and directs the Secretary of Transportation to assist and cooperate with other Federal departments and agencies, State and local governments, private industry, and other interested parties, to increase highway safety. Requires each State to have a highway safety program to reduce traffic deaths and injuries. Requires each State to achieve conformity in laws and practices which affect interstate motorists. Sets forth an apportionment formula for Federal funding of State highway safety programs. Directs each State to authorize its political subdivisions to develop and carry out local highway safety programs. Requires that at least 40 percent of a State's apportionment for highway safety programs be available for expenditures by the State's political subdivisions to carry out local highway safety programs. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirement where there is an insufficient number of local highway safety programs to justify such an expenditure. Requires each State highway safety agency to annually submit its proposed highway safety program for the ensuing fiscal year to the Secretary for approval. Stipulates that the Federal share of a highway safety project shall not exceed 80 percent of its cost. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to those States which develop the most innovative approaches to highway safety programs. Authorizes the Secretary to use funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for highway safety research and development projects. Establishes within the Department of Transportation a National Highway Safety Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on matters relating to the activities and functions of the Department in the field of highway safety. Requires each State to annually certify to the Secretary that it is enforcing the national maximum speed limit. Directs the Secretary to reduce a State's apportionment for Federal-aid highway funds if the percentage of motor vehicles exceeding 55 miles per hour exceeds a specified percentage."
