Stipulates that a violation of such provisions or of the provision prohibiting interference with commerce through robbery, acts of violence, or extortion shall not be nullified or mitigated by the fact that such acts are also in violation of State or local law or took place in the course of a legitimate labor dispute or in pursuit of legitimate union objectives."
