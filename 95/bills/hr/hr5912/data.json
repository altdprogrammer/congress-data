    "text": "Agricultural Solar Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act - Title I: Existing Programs - Amends the Bankhead-Jones Act of 1935 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct and to stimulate research and development relating to uses of solar energy with respect to farm buildings, farm homes and farm machinery. Authorizes the appropriation of $25,000,000 each fiscal year to carry out such research and development. Includes the agricultural uses of solar energy in the agricultural extension programs. Directs that loans, under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, be made for the purchase of farm equipment which utilizes solar energy and for the acquisition and installation of any qualified solar energy thermal conversion system in any residential structure located on a family farm. Title II: Solar Demonstration Farms - Establishes within the Department of Agriculture the Research and Demonstration Planning Committee which shall be responsible for compiling a list of solar energy research projects and for meeting with regional representatives of the State departments of agriculture to determine which projects will be useful and beneficial to the several States. Requires each State department of agriculture to establish one large model farm and within one year to establish not less than ten demonstrations of solar energy research projects using the most efficient or practicable research projects demonstrated on such model farm. Stipulates the terms of any agreement entered into between selected farmowners and the State departments of agriculture for the establishment of such demonstration projects. Authorizes the appropriation of $20,000,000 for the purposes of this title, of which 80 percent is to be used by State departments of agriculture for the model farm and demonstration projects."
