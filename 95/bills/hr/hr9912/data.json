Authorizes the Secretary of Labor, upon receiving the boards' report, to order a cooling-off period of up to 30 days, during which he may order the parties to prepare their final offers on the issues and to bargain collectively. Requires the parties to appoint a panel to resolve the dispute if collective bargaining fails to do so."
