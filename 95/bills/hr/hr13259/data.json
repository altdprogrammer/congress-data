    "date": "1978-06-22", 
    "text": "Nuclear Waste Disposal Act - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to commence a public proceeding to determine: (1) whether reliable information exists to support a conclusion that radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power reactors (including decommissioning wastes) and spent nuclear fuel can be safely contained and stored until decayed to harmless levels; and (2) whether a definite plan exists for storage of radioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel, including retrievability. Provides that if the Commission finds in the negative on either or both of the findings, the Commission shall not authorize the commencement of construction of additional nuclear power reactors, nor issue licenses for such construction until new evidence is presented which justifies findings in the affirmative. Requires that the Department of Energy be a party in the proceedings."
