    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1427) Provides for the distribution by the Secretary of the Interior of funds appropriated to pay a judgment to the Cowlitz Tribe of Indians in a certain case before the Indian Claims Commission. Disallows persons enrolled as members of other tribes to share in the award, except those descendants of the Cowlitz who are enrolled with the Yakima tribe. Requires that $310,000 of the award be set aside by the Secretary, in trust, for the purchase of land if the tribe gains Federal recognition within five years of enactment. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring lands through condemnation. Requires lands purchased to be taken in trust by the United States for the Cowlitz tribe. Requires that the retained funds be paid out in supplemental per capita payment if the tribe fails to gain Federal recognition. Provides for the balance of funds to be paid per capita to enrolled Cowlitz Indians with shares of minors and legal incompetents to be held by the Secretary in trust. Provides that distributions shall not be subject to Federal or State taxes nor affect a recipient's right to benefits under any federally assisted program."
