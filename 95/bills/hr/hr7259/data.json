    "text": "Siletz Indian Tribe Restoration Act - Restores Federal recognition and benefits (except hunting, fishing, and trapping rights) to the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon. Reopens the final membership list of the Siletz. Provides procedures for the election, under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, of an interim tribal council, which shall govern the Siletz until the adoption of permanent bylaws and a constitution. Provides for a tribal election, under the supervision of the Secretary and the interim council, for adoption of a constitution and bylaws establishing a permanent government and tribal membership rules. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Tribes and appropriate State and local officials, to draft and propose legislation within two years of this Act which would establish a Siletz reservation in Lincoln County, Oregon. Specifies substantive criteria for such legislation, including: (1) provisions for the maintenance of State civil and criminal jurisdiction over the reservation's citizens; (2) the survival of pre-existing rights, obligations, and restrictions on the reservation's land (which would be held in trust for the Siletz by the Federal Government); (3) the elimination of future taxation of the land; and (4) restrictions against the restoration or creation of any hunting, fishing, or trapping rights."
