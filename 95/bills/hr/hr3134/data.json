Directs the Coast Guard to develop additional monitoring systems and technologies designed to control vessel traffic in congested areas. Requires that vessels contain specified navigational equipment. Requires that vessels be constructed in accordance with specific requirements so as to reduce the possibility of accidents and resultant damage. Establishes procedures for enforcement and inspection by the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Directs the Secretary to establish a coordinated program of experimentation with methods to reduce oil spill incidents and minimize damages. Imposes civil penalties for discharges of oil into the aquatic and terrestrial environment in harmful quantities upon owners and operators of vessels, offshore facilities, and licenses of deepwater ports. Imposes criminal penalties for failure to report oil spills. Imposes strict liability, within specified limits, for cleanup costs incurred in connection with oil spills. Establishes the Federal Oil Pollution Liability and Compensation Administration within the Department of Transportation.

Imposed a five-cent per barrel fee on owners of oil and the time of transfer to collect monies for the Fund. Requires that owners or operators of vessels and offshore facilities establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility. Establishes procedures for adjudication of claims arising under this Act. Authorizes States to impose more stringent requirements.
