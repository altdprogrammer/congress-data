Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to subsidize families who agree to care for their dependents who are 65 years of age or older and who would otherwise require, because of physical or mental infirmities, the services of a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility, in their own homes. Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide payment for elderly day care center services under the supplementary medical insurance program. Directs the Secretary to institute a program under which qualified organizations, public and private, will submit plans for the development of carefully conceived and innovative projects to meet the special health care, housing, and related needs of elderly persons in a campus-type setting. Authorizes the Secretary to make interest subsidy payments to holders of mortgages covering such projects. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to insure mortgages secured by properties in projects built pursuant to this Act. Amends Title XVIII to provide payment for extended and intermediate care services under the supplementary medical insurance program. Amends Title XVIII to provide for the creation of an alternative reimbursement formula which will allow participating hospitals with less than 100 beds and less than 60 percent average occupancy to provide long-term care without applying proportional allocation of overhead costs to all patients in such facilities."
