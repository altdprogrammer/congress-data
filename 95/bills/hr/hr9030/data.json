    "text": "Better Jobs and Income Act - States that it is the intent of Congress to provide training and job opportunities to principal earners in families with children and to provide income support and supplementation to low-income families and individuals. States that Congress finds it necessary to consolidate and reform Federal and State income assistance programs. Title I: Cash Assistance Program Under The Social Security Act - Amends the Social Security Act to add Title XXI entitled \"Income Supplement and Income Support for Families and Individuals\". Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), in accordance with the provisions of such Title, to make payments to an eligible household unit (household), as such term is defined in this Act, for any month in which the available income of such household is less than the maximum amount payable according to provisions of this Act, and in which the value of the household's assets does not exceed the allowable amount specified in this Act. Excludes from eligibility for payments as a member of a household: (1) individuals who are not citizens of the United States or aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States; (2) individuals confined in penal or correctional institutions; (3) inmates of public institutions. Directs HEW to assist in the effective implementation of the Employment Opportunities Program established by Title II of this Act and to notify the Secretary of Labor of each adult member of a household with respect to which amounts are payable under this Act. Enumerates exemptions to such reporting requirement based on the need of an otherwise available worker in the home, the disability of such an individual, or status as a full-time student. Directs HEW, in the case of any blind or disabled individual who has not attained age 65 and who is receiving payments under this Act, to provide for referral of such individual to the appropriate State agency administering the State plan for vocational rehabilitation services approved under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Directs the referral of such an individual who is under age 16 to the State agency administering the State plan, required by this Act, for services to disabled children and for review, at least quarterly, of the blindness or disability of such individual and of the need for and utilization of the services made available under such plan. Specifies the amount of payment to a household. States that such amount shall be the \"maximum payable amount,\" as determined by regulations set forth in this Act, reduced by the amount of \"available income,\" as determined under provisions of this Act. Directs the payment of sum in addition to the amount payable to an eligible household in order to offset liability for Federal income tax due on earned income. Sets forth tables specifying the maximum amount payable to a household according to the number of members and the status of each member as adult, child, or aged, blind or disabled. Reduces the amount payable for each member who is eligible for subsidized work or training under the Employment Opportunities Program established by Title II of this Act and who is required to be referred to the Secretary of Labor, unless such member is certified as being incapacitated or has not been offered employment or training. Prohibits the payment of benefits under this Act to a household if the value of its nonbusiness assets exceeds $5,000 in any month, or if the value of its business assets held for the production of self-employment income exceeds, in any month, a limit prescribed by HEW. Excludes from the determination of nonbusiness assets of a household: (1) the home, if it is the residence of such household; (2) the household goods and personal effects, including tools or similar items necessary for a member to engage in gainful employment; and (3) separate, identifiable amounts set aside for burial expenses. Directs that the payment to a household in Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands be scaled according to the ratio of the per capita incomes of such territories in fiscal year 1980 to the per capita income of the State having the lowest such income. Requires that the determination of available income and the value of nonbusiness assets be similarly scaled. Exempts household members in such territories from the requirement for subsidized work or training until such time as the Employment Opportunities Program established by Title II of this Act extended to such territories. Authorizes the States to enter into agreements with HEW under which the States will make supplemental payments to households receiving payment from HEW under this Act. Sets forth the method by which the amount of such supplements shall be determined. Requires the States to reimburse HEW for that portion of the cost of such supplements which is not covered by Federal participation. Sets forth directions for the computation of the amount of Federal participation in each State supplemental payment program. Requires each State to pay to HEW a specified percentage of the annual Federal expenditure for payments under this Act in order to assure that each State will continue to share responsibility for meeting the objectives of this Act. Establishes procedures to limit the fiscal liability of the States for participation in the program of State supplemental payments. Directs HEW to prescribe criteria for approval of State plans for counseling and services to blind or disabled children. Requires HEW to pay to the State agency administering such plan the costs incurred in each fiscal year. Sets forth requirements and measures for the administration of the income supplementation program established by this Act. Includes requirements for making application for benefits and for determining eligibility for benefits. Directs HEW to make adjustments in future payments for overpayments and underpayments to households. Requires HEW to establish procedures for the determination of disagreements by an affected individual. Establishes criminal penalties for fraud under this Act. Amends Title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act to establish a new program of grants to States to enable each State to furnish assistance to meet the living expenses of needy families and individuals which are not met under the payments program established by this Act. Directs HEW to pay to each State that has an approved plan for such assistance the total expenditures for the provision of such assistance. Sets limits on the total amount of such payments to any State for a given year. Excludes Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands from such program except when the need for emergency assistance arises from a natural disaster or other occurrence of regional or national significance beyond the control of the named territories. Authorizes the President to permit HEW to make payments to States for assistance in meeting living expenses when emergency conditions exist because of a natural disaster. Sets forth steps for the establishment of State plans to administer the assistance program established under Title XX. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to increase the amount of the credit against personal income tax to which an individual is entitled based on the individual's earned income. Excludes from the definition of the term \"earned income\" amounts received as compensation for subsidized work and training under the Employment Opportunities Program established under Title II of this Act. Repeals Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act and the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and the Work Incentive Program for Recipients of AFDC of Title IV of such Act. Repeals the Food Stamp Act of 1964. Title II: Employment Opportunities Program - Establishes an employment opportunities program under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 pursuant to which the Secretary of Labor is to provide financial assistance to prime sponsors under the comprehensive manpower services program, Indian tribes on State or Federal reservation, and, where no appropriate prime sponsor or Indian tribe exists, other entities. Conditions assistance under this title upon submission and approval of an employment opportunities plan, each such plan to include (1) a job search assistance program, (2) a subsidized work and training opportunities program, (3) provisions to assure integrated administration of such programs and for relating programs under this title to other public and private programs and activities, and (4) provisions for public hearings. Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance to the State Governors to be used for certain activities facilitating and coordinating implementation of approved plans. States that any adult who is a member of a household unit which includes a child or which has been determined to be eligible for cash assistance under title I shall be eligible for job search assistance. Specifies minimum requirements for job search assistance programs, among them (1) use of a computerized job matching program in cooperation with the State employment security agency, (2) a program of job search assistance services, (3) referral to job opportunities of eligible individuals for an initial eight-week period and, thereafter, of eligible individuals who are members of household receiving assistance under title I of this Act and who have not found unsubsidized private or public employment, and (4) referral of eligible persons to subsidized work or training opportunities. Limits eligibility for subsidized work and training assistance to principal or sole earners in households which include at least one child, or to adults in such households if no household member has had earned income for six months, who have been unable to obtain unsubsidized work through the job search program. Requires that each subsidized work and training program plan include (1) the provision of both full- and part-time opportunities for subsidized work and training designed to lead to unsubsidized work, (2) specified assurances relative to wages, leave, and other working conditions of participants, (3) provisions for terminating participation of an individual after 52 weeks of subsidized work and training and for continuing wages or allowances to such a person during a designated period of renewed job search activity, and (4) provisions for subsequent placement in subsidized positions of eligible person unable to find work during the renewed job search period."
