    "text": "Northern Irish Relief Act - Authorizes the issuance of 25,000 special immigrant visas to British citizens who are residents of Northern Ireland and who are seeking admission into the United States to avoid the consequences of war, armed conflict, civil disorder or persecution. Authorizes such special visas to aliens from Northern Ireland who would be eligible to enter the United States pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act but for the fact that a visa is not immediately available under such Act. Exempts the provisions of this Act from British citizens who are residents of Northern Ireland seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor. Exempts aliens receiving a visa under this Act from paying the fees required by the Immigration and Nationality Act. Allows an alien already in this country on a nonimmigrant visa who is eligible for a visa under this Act to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident."
