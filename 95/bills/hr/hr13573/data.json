Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income punitive damages (two-thirds of antitrust treble damages) received by a private litigant if such litigant brings suit against a particular defendant before the Federal Government institutes criminal proceedings. Disallows tax deductions for antitrust punitive damages paid or incurred by a taxpayer."
