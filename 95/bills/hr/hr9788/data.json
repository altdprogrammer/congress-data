    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to health maintenance organizations for the construction of ambulatory services to be used by such organizations for the provision of health services to their members in medically underserved areas. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans for the same purpose to such organizations in areas which are not medically underserved. Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to set forth new regulations governing the payment of the cost of medical services incurred by a member of a health maintenance organization. Amends Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to permit reimbursement to States for payments made to health maintenance organizations in cases where such payments would have previously been prohibited because of the eligibility of a significant percentage of the members of such an organization for medicare payments when it is determined that the health needs of the population affected are best served by such organization."
