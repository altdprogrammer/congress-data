    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Coal Transportation Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to make coal pipelines operating in interstate commerce subject to regulation under such Act. Stipulates that charges for the transportation of coal by pipeline based on long-term commitments are presumptively unlawful unless finally approved by the Commission for use by common carriers by railroad. Prohibits coal pipeline carriers from transporting coal in interstate commerce where such carrier has an interest in such coal. Requires the construction and maintenance of feeder or distribution lines by coal pipeline carriers. Prohibits abandonment of existing pipelines without certification by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Establishes procedures governing issuance of such certificates. Imposes civil penalties for illegal abandonment of existing pipelines. Establishes procedures governing the granting of easements to coal pipeline carriers by the Commission in accordance with prescribed criteria. Requires that Commission approval be obtained prior to transfers, mergers, and acquisitions involving coal pipeline carriers. Lists criteria to be considered by the Commission in evaluating such proposed transactions. Prohibits the Commission from issuing certificates of public convenience and necessity to coal pipeline carriers without receiving the advice of the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission that such action would not contravene antitrust laws. Establishes procedures for enforcement of the requirements of this Act against coal pipeline carriers by the Attorney General upon the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Imposes criminal and civil penalties for such violations. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations to apply the provisions of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to coal pipelines."
