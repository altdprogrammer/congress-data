    "text": "Air Traffic Control Pay Reform Act - Establishes position classifications ATC-1 through ATC-9 and corresponding pay rates for Federal employees who are air traffic controllers, including operations personnel. Requires trainees and controllers below journeyman to be classified in positions ATC-1 through ATC-8 on the basis of the level of proficiency required to perform the functions of such positions. Requires journeyman controllers to be classified at grades ATC-4 through ATC-9 on the basis of points received which reflect the type of facility where such controller performs duties, described as; (1) nonapproach terminal (VFR tower); (2) nonradar approach control terminal; (3) radar approach control terminal; (4) limited radar approach control terminal; or (5) air route traffic control center, and the characteristics of such facility such as volume of air traffic handled, runway configurations, mix of speed, performance characteristic, and mission of aircraft using such facility, and limitations on the use of airspace. Permits annual step increases in salaries within each grade classification. Requires vacancies in positions at air traffic control facilities where the work situation is not excessively demanding to be filled first from applicants who have been journeyman controllers for five or more years at a facility at which the work situation has been determined to be excessively demanding. Subjects the salaries established by this Act to the pay comparability system to which General Schedule salaries are subject. Permits controller supervisors to be paid at a rate at least one grade higher than the highest grade of any employee such person regularly supervises."
