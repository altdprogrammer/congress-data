    "text": "National Child Nutrition Act - Repeals the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and combines their respective lunch and breakfast programs into a single school-meals program under a centralized administration. Extends the authority for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) through fiscal year 1980 and for the Child Care Food Program through 1983. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish, for food assistance payments to State education agencies, national average basic rates not less than: (1) 11.5 cents per breakfast and 14.5 per lunch (currently 10 cents); (2) 21.75 cents per reduced-price breakfast and 55 cents per reduced-price lunch; and (3) 28.75 cents per free breakfast and 65 cents per free lunch. Specifies: (1) conditions under which States shall receive free and reduced-price meal payments; and (2) income requirements for children participating in the program. Authorizes $75,000,000 for food service equipment assistance. Authorizes the appropriation of funds to encourage the consumption of fluid milk (special milk program) by children in non-profit schools (high school and under) and child care institutions. Requires the Secretary to prepare a set of performance guidelines outlining the objectives of the child-feeding programs. Requires each State agency to submit annually to the Secretary a State Plan of Child Nutrition Operations providing, in part, for statewide targeted outreach to low-income areas. Specifies administrative and equitable remedies available to the Secretary in response to failures by State or local agencies to comply with any provisions of this Act."
