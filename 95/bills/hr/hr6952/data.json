Requires such reports to be generally made available to the public. Prohibits the use of information from such reports for commercial, credit, or solicitation purposes. Title II: Office of Government Ethics - Establishes within the Civil Service Commission the Office of Government Ethics with which the President, Vice President, agency heads, and presidential appointees shall file their financial disclosure statements (Requires other Federal personnel to file with the head of the agency employing such persons or, in the case of presidential or vice-presidential candidates, with the Federal Elections Commission). Charges the Office with responsibility for overall direction of Executive branch policies related to preventing conflicts of interest, monitoring compliance with this Act, and conducting random audits of reports required by this Act to ascertain possible violations of conflict of interest laws. Title III: Post-Employment Restrictions - Extends from one to two years the period of prohibition on appearances before an agency by a former Federal employee or official on matters that were under such person's responsibility. Includes within such prohibition informal as well as formal contacts. Prohibits formal and informal contacts with such agencies of former employment on other matters for a period of one year after the end of such employment."
