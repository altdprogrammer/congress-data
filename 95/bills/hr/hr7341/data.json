    "text": "Telecommunications Privacy Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to add a new title which replaces and generally revises provisions relative to the interception of oral and wire communications. Increases the types of communications which are protected from unlawful interference. Narrows present exceptions to the prohibitions against interception and/or disclosure of the content of protected communications. Amends procedures for obtaining authorization to intercept and for subsequently intercepting protected communications to, among other changes, (1) permit interceptions only with respect to investigations of crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for five years or longer, (2) require prior judicial authorization for all interceptions, (3) require orders to include procedures to minimize intrusion, (4) repeal certain provisions relative to extensions of orders and (5) set forth procedures for common communications carriers and operators of private communication systems to obtain orders to intercept communications for certain persons. Restricts the persons who may disclose the content of intercepted communications and the circumstances under which such information may be disclosed."
