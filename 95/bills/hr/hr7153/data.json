    "text": "Aid for Dependent Children Quality Control Act - Amends Title IV, Part A of the Social Security Act (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) to require participating States to: (1) establish procedures for determining the extent of overpayments, underpayments, or payments to ineligible recipients made under the State plan; (2) review actions of the agency administering such plan denying or terminating aid under the plan; (3) coordinate quality control activities under this Act with corresponding activities under other federally assisted welfare programs; and (4) submit to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare a complete description of procedures used to implement quality control activities as well as data (in dollar terms) on payment errors, distinguishing between errors which directly affect the payment of aid under the program and procedural errors that can be rectified. Directs the Secretary to complete an error rate (in dollar terms) for each State based upon information submitted by each State, and authorizes the Secretary to reduce Federal payments to each State whose error rate exceeds the median error rate for all States or its own official rate by the amount by which the payment errors exceed the median error rate. Sets forth procedures under which a State may have such a reduction waived, decreased, or otherwise adjusted. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of means by which quality control procedures of Federal welfare programs can be effectively coordinated and requires the Secretary to submit his findings and recommendations to Congress within one year of enactment of the Act."
