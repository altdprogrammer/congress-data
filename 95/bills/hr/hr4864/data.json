    "text": "Agricultural Research Act - States the findings of Congress that the Department of Agriculture should continue to serve as the lead agency in the executive branch for agricultural research. States the purpose of this Act to be the encouragement and facilitation of the development and maintenance of a unified Federal agricultural research policy upon which the overall Federal research effort can be used. Title I: Agricultural Research Policy, Research, and Education - Establishes in the Department of Agriculture a permanent Agricultural Research and Education Policy Advisory Committee, composed of 21 members, to advise the Secretary with respect to national agricultural research and policies, including priorities for basic and applied agricultural research, the administration of agricultural research and policies for education and training in agricultural research. Authorizes the Committee to establish subcommittees to review disciplinary and commodity research priorities, funding and administrative questions, and individual questions of research education and training. Authorizes the Secretary to establish an Agricultural Research Policy Analysis Institute to conduct research on matters of policy regarding all aspects of agricultural research and related matters. States that the Agricultural Research and Education Policy Advisory Committee shall serve as the Board of Directors of the Institute, which may have up to 20 full-time professional members. Designates the Department of Agriculture as the lead agency of the Federal Government to coordinate all agricultural research activities in other Federal departments and agencies, the land grant colleges, the State agricultural experiment stations, and research in the private sector. Establishes within the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology a Subcommittee on Food and Renewable Resources to review Federal research and development programs relevant to world food and fiber production and distribution, to promote planning and coordination of such research in the Federal Government and to recommend policies and measures concerning food and agricultural science for the consideration of the Council. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of competitive grants for agricultural research to be made to individual scientists and to institutions for research in four categories aimed at: (1) the discovery of new scientific principles and techniques applicable in agriculture and forestry; (2) the development of innovative products and technology in such fields as biological nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis; (3) the field of human nutrition; (4) the development of new crops, including guayule and jojoba. Requires the Secretary to give priority to research in those fields of basic and applied science promising advances and breakthroughs. Allows up to five percent of funds awarded in any fiscal year to be granted to support research conducted outside the United States. Permits the Secretary to require matching State funds for any research grants made. Repeals the existing requirement that at least 20 percent of grant funds distributed to the States be used by State agricultural experiment stations for marketing research. Transfers the administration of additional appropriations for agricultural colleges from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to the Department of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary to conduct a program of competitive grants and fellowships for merit to strengthen undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral research in the agricultural sciences. Authorizes for each grant program established under this title specified sums to be appropriated for each fiscal year from 1978 through 1980 or 1982. Authorizes the Secretary to appoint a Committee on Agricultural Research Facilities to assist him in the compilation of a report to the President and the Congress on the status and future needs of agricultural research materials and facilities, including buildings and farms, plant, seed, genetic stock, insect, virus and animal collections, computers and laboratory instrumentation. States that the report shall include recommendations for a program aimed at providing the Nation with the most modern and efficient system of research facilities needed to advance agricultural research in all fields. Authorizes the Secretary to establish the National Agricultural Research Award, consisting of a grant not to exceed $50,000 per year for a period of not more than three years to support research or study by: (1) a scientists in recognition of outstanding contributions to the advance of agricultural science; and (2) a graduate student or post-doctoral research worker in recognition of demonstrated capability and promise. Requires the Secretary to submit to the President and the Congress an annual report containing an annually updated five-year national agricultural research plan, a review of progress made toward the accomplishment of planned goals, and a review of specified categories of agricultural research activities of the Department and their relationship to the related activities of other Federal, State and private agencies. Authorizes specified sums to be appropriated for existing agricultural research programs for fiscal years 1978 through 1982. Title II: Animal Health Care and Research - Directs the Secretary to establish an Animal Health Science Research Advisory Board to recommend priorities for the conduct of animal health research programs. Directs that funds appropriated for such programs be apportioned as follows: (1) four percent retained by the Department for administration and program assistance; and (2) 96 percent to go to accredited colleges of veterinary medicine and agricultural experiment stations in the several States. Requires the dean or director of each eligible institution to cause preparation of and to review project proposals which comply with the purpose and provisions of this Act. Sets the Federal contribution to any eligible institution at $100,000 in addition to amounts matching funds from non-Federal sources. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a program of grants to assist States which do not have an accredited college of veterinary medicine in the construction of such, the employment of faculty, the acquisition of equipment and other necessaries. Specifies the formula by which funds appropriated shall be distributed to the States for these purposes. Authorizes for grant programs specified sums to be appropriated for fiscal years 1978 through 1982."
