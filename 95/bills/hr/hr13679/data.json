Requires individuals who pay for services relating to the harvesting or transportation of timber to report to the Secretary of the Treasury on the identity of the individuals providing such services and the total amount paid to them and to furnish such individuals with a written statement of the information reported to the Secretary. Imposes fines for failure to comply with such reporting requirements."
