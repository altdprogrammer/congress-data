Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to waive or reduce any such percentage minimum for a period not to exceed one year under specified circumstances. Deems such decision a final agency action for judicial review purposes. Declares the provisions of this Act to be nonapplicable to situations where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect which establishes the number of hours of employment in a week."
