Amends Title II and the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to provide that income of all types, except payments for retirement injury or illness, shall be included in determining whether an individual's benefits are subject to deductions. Eliminates the requirement that an individual must have been entitled to disability benefits for at least 24 consecutive months to qualify for Medicare on the basis of disability. Eliminates the five-month waiting period presently required for individuals to qualify for disability benefits under the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program."
