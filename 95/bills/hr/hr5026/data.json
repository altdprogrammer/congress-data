States that no appropriation shall be made to construct, alter, or otherwise acquire any medical facility which involves a total expenditure of more than $1,000,000 unless such construction, alteration, or acquisition is first approved by resolution adopted by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, respectively. Stipulates that no appropriation shall be made to lease any space at an average annual rental of more than $200,000 for use for a medical facility unless such lease is first approved by resolutions adopted by such committees. Enumerates structural requirements for any medical facilities pursuant to this Act. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress an annual report regarding the construction, alteration, and leasing of medical facilities. Requires such report to contain: (1) a five-year plan for those medical facilities most in need of construction, replacement and alteration; (2) a priority list of at least ten such hospitals, and (3) general plans for each medical facility in the five-year plan or the list. Directs the Administrator to establish and operate not less than 10,000 beds in the fiscal year 1980 and in each fiscal year thereafter, for the furnishing of nursing home care to eligible veterans in facilities over which the Administrator has direct and exclusive jurisdiction."
