    "date": "1977-05-13", 
    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 95-315) Youth Camp Safety Act - Imposes on each youth camp operator a duty to provide each camper with (1) safe and healthful camps free from recognized hazards, and (2) adequate and qualified supervision and instructions. Establishes in the Office of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare an Office of Youth Camp Safety to be headed by a Director with responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of Federal and State youth camp safety regulations. Requires the Director to submit to the President and Congress at least once a year a report on his administration under this Act. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and modification of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Director for his approval. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in a United States court of appeals. Authorizes the Director to make grants to States which have in effect approved State plans, such grants not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of carrying out the State plan. Authorizes the Director to enter and inspect youth camps and their records in States which do not have in effect a plan approved by the Director. Requires the Director to inspect each such youth camp at least once a year during the period the camp is in operation. Prescribes penalties for each violation by youth camp operators of the standards promulgated pursuant to this Act. Establishes procedures whereby corrective steps can be taken by U.S. district courts, upon petition of the Director, to counteract imminent dangers existing in any youth camp. Permits the Director to grant variances to youth camp operators in States which do not have approved plans. Charges the Director with establishing within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare a Federal Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety. Authorizes the Director to request and receive directly from any department or agency of the Federal Government information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics needed to carry out the functions under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of $7,500,000 for fiscal year 1978 and for each of the four succeeding fiscal years to carry out this Act."
