Revises the deadline for the Commission's final and initial interim reports, and requires the Commission to submit an additional interim report. Exempts the Commission from certain provisions of the Federal Reports Act which require clearance from the Office of Management and Budget for information gathering. Provides that any reports the Commission makes to Congress shall be made directly and without clearance from the Office of Management and Budget. Amends the Social Security Act to provide for Federal matching for services to non-AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) families on a permanent basis. Exempts certain States from the requirement of the January 1977, through September 1977, audit of all State child support enforcement programs under Title IV (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of the Social Security Act by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to approve a claim for refund, credit, or adjustment for overpayment of Social Security taxes by the Jefferson County Mental Health Center (Colorado)."
