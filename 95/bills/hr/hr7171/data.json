    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #478 (294-114)) Agricultural Act - =Title I: Payment Limitation for Wheat, Feed Grains and Upland Cotton= - Sets increasing amounts of payment limitations for each crop year from 1978 through 1981 for persons entitled to receive payments for wheat, feed grains or upland cotton under the annual programs established by the Agricultural Acts of 1949 and 1970. =Title II: Dairy and Beekeeper Programs= - Extends the effectiveness of Class I dairy base plans through 1984 and of other dairy base plans through 1981. Extends through 1981 the authority for making dairy products available to veterans' hospitals and to the Armed Forces, and for making indemnity payments to dairy farmers who sustain losses as a result of pesticides or, new with this Act, as a result of nuclear radiation of fallout. Sets the price support of milk at not less than 80 percent of parity, adjusted at the beginning of each semiannual period after the beginning of the marketing year and at the beginning of each remaining quarter. Extends through fiscal year 1981 the provisions of the beekeeper indemnity program. =Title III: Wool and Mohair= - Extends through 1981 the price support provisions of the National Wool Act of 1954. Excepts 1977 from the current price support of 80.2 cents per pound, grease basis; sets such support, for the years 1977 through 1981, at 85 percent of the amount calculated according to a specified formula. Excepts 1977 from the current price support for mohair; but makes no provision for such support for the years 1977 through 1981. =Title IV: Wheat= - Extends specified provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, through 1981. Raises the loan level for wheat to not less than $2.25 per bushel for the 1977 crops and to $2.35 per bushel for the 1978 through 1981 crops. Permits the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce the level of loans and purchases of wheat if the average price of wheat is less than 105 percent of such level. Requires the Secretary, if he makes such an adjustment to increase the target price for wheat to provide the same total return as if such adjustment had not been made. Replaces the current established price with a target price and establishes such target price at $2.90 per bushel for the 1977 crop, at $3.00 per bushel for 1978, and for the 1979 through 1981 crops at an amount calculated according to a specified formula. Sets formulae, effective in 1978 and 1979, for disaster payments and for prevented planting payments to compensate producers prevented from planting acreage intended for wheat because of drought, flood or other natural disaster. Suspends, for producers, processors and handlers, the marketing certificate program for the 1974 through 1981 wheat crops. Extends the set-aside program and current yield calculations through 1981. Substitutes, for the existing specified formulae for the determination of wheat acreage allotments, a single general formula based on an allocation factor found by dividing the announced national wheat acreage allotment by the number of harvested acres. Multiplies the allocation factor by the acreage of wheat harvested on the farm in the current crop year to determine each farm's allotment. =Title V: Feed Grains= - Extends specified provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, through the 1981 crops. Raises the loan level for corn to $2.00 per bushel for each of the 1977 through 1981 crops. Requires the Secretary to reduce the level of loans and purchases of corn, if the average price of corn is less than 105 percent of such level. Requires the Secretary, if he makes such an adjustment, to increase the target price for corn to provide the same total return as if such adjustment had not been made. Replaces the established price of feed grains with a target price and sets such target price of corn at $2.00 per bushel for the 1977 crop, at $2.10 per bushel for 1978, and the 1979 through 1981 crops at the previous year's target price, adjusted to reflect changes in the average adjusted cost of production over the previous two to four years. Substitutes, for the existing specified formulae for the determination of feed grain acreage allotments, a single general formula based on an allocation factor found by dividing the announced national feed grain acreage allotment by the number of harvested acres. Multiplies the allocation factor by the acreage of feed grain harvested on the farm in the current crop year to determine each farm's allotment. =Title VI: Cotton= - Revises the cotton program's disaster payments and set aside provisions. Revises the formula basis of the level for nonrecourse loans for the 1978 through 1981 crops. Directs the President to proclaim a special limited global import quota, subject to specified conditions, whenever the average price of Strict Low Middling one and one-sixteenth inch cotton exceeds a specified maximum. Sets the established price per pound of cotton at 110 percent of the loan level, or 51 cent per pound, whichever is less. =Title VII: Rice= - Extends through 1981 specified provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Rice Production Act of 1975. States that for the 1978 through 1981 crops: (1) the established price shall be the established price for the previous year's crop adjusted to reflect any change in specified costs; and (2) the loan level shall bear the same ratio to the loan rate for the preceding year's crop as the established price for each year bears to the established price for the preceding year's crop. Requires that payments to cooperators planting not less than 90 percent of their allotment shall be based on the entire amount of such allotments. Requires that, beginning with the 1978 crop the $55,000 limitation on the total amount of payments to any eligible person shall be reduced 5 percent for each crop year from the limitation in effect for the previous crop year, never, though, below the limitation in effect for wheat, feed grains and cotton. =Title VIII: Peanuts= - Peanut Production Act - Suspends, for the 1978 through 1981 crops, provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 relating to national marketing quotas and county acreage allotments. Establishes an annual national acreage allotment for peanuts, not less than 1,610,000 acres. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to announce a minimum national poundage quota each year. Requires, for each farm, a farm yield determined according to a specified formula, a farm base production poundage and a farm poundage quota. Requires the Secretary to permit the sale, lease and transfer of acreage allotments, and prescribes the basis of such transfers. Increases the penalty for the marketing of peanuts in excess of a farm's quota from 75 percent to 120 percent of the support price for quota peanuts. Establishes similar penalties for handlers marketing peanuts larger in quantity or higher in quality than the quota peanuts they should be acquiring. Allows the Commodity Credit Corporation to make available for domestic edible use peanuts owned or controlled by it, under specified pricing conditions. Subjects all farmers engaged in peanut production to existing record and report requirements. Establishes the price support of peanuts at not less than $420 per ton. Permits the Secretary to make warehouse storage loans available to designated area marketing associations of peanut producers. =Title IX: Miscellaneous Commodity Provisions= - Establishes, for the 1977 through 1981 crops of wheat, feed grains and cotton, a minimum diversion of 55 percent of cropland acreage on summer fallow farms for summer fallow use. Directs the Secretary to permit loan borrowers to extend repayment periods for additional twelve month terms under specified conditions. Prohibits the Commodity Credit Corporation from selling wheat or feed grain owned or controlled by it for less than 150 percent of the current loan level, with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Secretary to administer a special program whereunder portions of wheat, feed grains or upland cotton farm acreage allotments shall be planted to wheat and used for grazing purposes or hay. Directs the Secretary to set the loan level for any commodity at 100 percent of parity on any day the President of the United States or any other member of the executive branch, initiates a suspension of export sales of such commodity to any country or area with which the United States continues commercial trade. Requires the Commodity Credit Corporation, under the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, to make available loans not in excess of $50,000 for the construction or remodeling of farm storage facilities. Directs the Secretary to make available to producers loans and purchases on each crop of soybeans at such level as he finds appropriate. Requires that export sales of 100,000 metric tons or more of a commodity be reported to the Secretary by 3 P.M., eastern time, on the business day following the day of sale. Restricts the importation of filbert nuts, whenever the Secretary issues a marketing order, to those filbert nuts that comply with the grade, size, quality and maturity provisions of the order. Directs the Secretary to collect and analyze information and to report his conclusions and recommendations to the appropriate Congressional committees regarding the use of bushels of wheat and feed grains and pounds of rice as the basis for assigning allotments to producers of such commodities. Directs the Secretary to establish a price support program for 1977 sugar beets and sugar cane. Authorizes the Secretary to establish price supports for the 1978-1981 crops of soybeans, flaxseed, dry edible beans, gum naval stores and other non-basic commodities.
