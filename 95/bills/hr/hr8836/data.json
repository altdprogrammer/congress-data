Stipulates that the amount of such assistance shall be the difference between the rates charged by United States flag vessels and the rates charged by foreign flag vessels for comparable shipping. Requires that the rate charged for such transportation be reduced by the amount of such payment. Authorizes appropriations in such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
