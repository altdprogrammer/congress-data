Permits the waiver of such obligation in any case where the State agency determines, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the imposition of such obligation or the making of such collection would impose undue hardship. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide that any amount collected from or otherwise paid by any person in satisfaction of any obligation imposed shall constitute a medical expense paid or incurred by such person for purposes of deductions under such Act."
