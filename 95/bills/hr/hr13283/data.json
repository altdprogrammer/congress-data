    "text": "Act to Combat International Terrorism - Directs the President to transmit a report to the Congress every six months on those incidents determined to be acts of international terrorism as defined in this Act. Requires that, where the incident involves citizens or property of the United States, such report be transmitted not more than 30 days after the incident. Stipulates that such report shall include a description of the incident and persons involved, the identity of any government providing support for such terrorist acts, a description of the actions of any government which assisted in bringing about a positive termination of the incident, and a description of the response of the United States to such incident. Directs the President to submit to the Congress a list of governments which have demonstrated a pattern of support for international terrorism. Directs the President with respect to countries appearing on such list to: (1) provide no assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; (2) not authorize any sale of, or extend any credit or guaranty, with respect to defense articles or services; (3) approve no export license for the export of commodities or technical data which has a potential military application or which would otherwise enable a foreign government to support acts of international terrorism; or (4) extend no duty-free treatment under the Trade Act of 1974. Authorizes the President to suspend such sanctions in the interest of national security. Authorizes the President to take such other actions with respect to such countries as are deemed appropriate. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to assess the effectiveness of the security measures at foreign airports. Directs the Secretary, upon a finding that such an airport does not maintain effective security measures, to notify the appropriate authorities of such foreign government of his findings and to recommend any steps necessary to bring the security measures in use to the standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Directs the Secretary to publish the names of foreign airports which fail to bring their security measures into compliance with such standards and to display the names of such airports at United States airports. Authorizes the Secretary to withhold, revoke, or impose conditions on the operating authority of any carrier or foreign air carrier to engage in foreign air transportation utilizing such an airport. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance concerning aviation security to foreign governments. Makes it unlawful for any person to manufacture explosive materials which do not contain identification taggants which are retrievable after detonation and which make possible the identification of the manufacturer, the date of manufacture and which provide such other information as the Secretary of the Treasury may require. Makes it unlawful to manufacture explosive materials which do not contain a detction taggant which permits detection of such material prior to its detonation. Makes the importation, transportation, or receipt of explosive materials without identification and detection taggants, illegal. Sets forth criminal penalties for violations of such taggant requirements. Makes it illegal: (1) to interfere with the operation of any civil aircraft; (2) to commit any act of violence against an aircraft passenger; or (3) to willfully communicate false information which endangers the safety of any aircraft while in flight. Imposes criminal penalties on individuals committing specified offenses against or on board aircraft registered in a State other than the United States and who are afterwards found in this country. Establishes criminal and civil penalties for individuals imparting false information regarding attempts or alleged attempts to commit specified crimes against aircraft. Directs the President to submit to Congress every two years a Report on Federal and International Capabilities to Combat Terrorism. Urges the President to seek international agreements to assure more effective international cooperation in combating terrorism. Directs the President to develop standards and programs to insure the full implementation of the provisions of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation (Montreal, September 23, 1971). Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to prescribe regulations and orders to prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of nuclear material security information which could result in the theft of nuclear material for use in a nuclear explosive device."
