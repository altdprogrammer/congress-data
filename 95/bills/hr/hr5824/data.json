States that such indemnification must be paid in accordance with formulae set forth in this Act. Title II: Contracts Between Sales Representatives and Principals - Sets forth provisions which must be included in any employment contract between sales representatives and their principals including: (1) rate of commission; (2) terms affecting advance payments or future compensation; and (3) a description of the sales territory. Lists duties of the principal with respect to furnishing such sales representative with information concerning his or her accounts or compensation. Title III: Miscellaneous - Sets forth procedures by which this Act may be enforced in any United States district court."
