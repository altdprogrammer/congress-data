    "text": "Right-of-Way Purchase and Railroad Employment Act - Title I: Purchase of Rights-of-Way - Authorizes railroads to submit applications to the Secretary of Transportation containing an offer to sell to the Federal Government all or any portion of the rights-of-way owned by such railroad. Sets forth the conditions under which the Secretary may accept such an offer. Directs the Secretary to enter into a leasing agreement with the selling railroad in which the railroad agrees to provide rail service over such rights-of-way and to make lease payments to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, with respect to rights-of-way which were subject to a property tax by a unit of local government, to make payments to such a government in lieu of taxes during a four year period. Title II: Right of Way Employment Projects - Authorizes the Secretary to conduct projects for the rehabilitation and improvement of rights-of-way acquired by the Secretary for the purpose of providing jobs for unemployed persons. Establishes a priority system for hiring such individuals. Stipulates that such workers shall be paid wages and benefits at rates no more than those rates prevailing on similar work in the same area and no less than the minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Title III: Investment by Railroads - Prohibits railroads which enter into contracts with the Secretary under this Act from acquiring any securities or any options on securities issued by any domestic or foreign private corporation or other private business organization."
