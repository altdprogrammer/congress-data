    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-11-03", 
    "text": "Coal Priority Transportation Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish energy priority routes for transportation of coal between regions of coal demand and coal supply without eliminating competition or violating antitrust laws. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to secure rights-of-way for coal pipelines over such priority routes. Title I: Transportation of Coal - Requires the identification of regions which are principal locations of coal supply and of coal demand to be published in the Federal Register after public hearings are held and all relevant data or information is presented. Enjoins submission of applications proposing priority energy routes by any carrier or prospective carrier by coal pipeline, to the Secretary of Energy who reviews and thereafter determines such routes. Authorizes the Secretary to certify any combination of one or more common carriers to transport coal over such established routes. Allows such carriers to enter into contracts with shippers or coal suppliers, filing such contract (or application for such a contract) with the Secretary for approval and public inspection. Restricts such contracts to not more than 30 years and, for railroads, to unit train service. Relieves parties to a contract approved by the Secretary from antitrust laws with respect to making and carrying out such agreement. Allows the Secretary to review and take appropriate action upon ascertaining a contravention between such carriers' activities and the terms and conditions prescribed or contracts approved. Empowers the Secretary to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity to a carrier provided such project: (1) balances the energy needs of the area with water requirements and environmental impact and (2) considers the impact of other modes of transportation. Sets forth the procedure for filing and obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing such certificates to coal carriers without receiving advice of the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission that such action would not contravene antitrust laws. Establishes procedures for enforcement of the requirements of this Act against such carriers by the Attorney General and Secretary. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for such violations. Title II: Carriers by Coal Pipeline - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to add the conservation of coal in the provision to allow States to include lands acquired from the United States in agreements approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Permits carriers by coal pipeline to acquire rights-of-way by the exercise of the power of eminent domain except for United States, State, or Indian lands. Restricts the power of eminent domain exercised by such carriers to those holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Prohibits such carriers from engaging in monopolies. Subjects carriers failing to obey an order to comply with provisions set forth to the same penalties established in the general provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. Requires compacts between such carriers engaged in interstate transportation and the Secretary before certification of public convenience and necessity and the acquisition of rights-of-way. Permits the Secretary to grant rights-of-way to additional projects compatible with other operations if such additional uses are in the public interest. Compensates persons entitled to exclusive use. Deems water resources, regulation of and right to such resources whether Federal, State, or private unaffected buy this Act. Requests underground construction of coal pipelines when practicable. Subjects carriers by coal pipeline to the general provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and the requirement of rights-of-way compacts with the Secretary."
