Title II: Commission on the Impact of Science and Technology on Society - Establishes the Commission on the Impact of Science and Technology on Society to analyze trends and developments in those areas of science and technology most relevant to social issues and problems, appraise their impact on society, and the choices for coping with that impact, and recommend specific courses of action to be taken. Directs the Commission to: (1) identify those technologies, industries, and other areas of the economy where the United States does not have comparative advantage or potential strength; (2) conduct a comprehensive study of Federal science policies relating to potentially hazardous scientific research activities; (3) examine the present Federal science and technology efforts and appraise their adequacy; and (4) submit to the President and Congress within 18 months of the Commission's conception, a report of its activities, and, within three years, submit a final report containing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Commission. Specifies that emphasis in the examination, analysis, and appraisal shall be on the impact of the given science and technology on society. Title III: - Miscellaneous Provisions - Specifies that the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to the Commission's activities.
