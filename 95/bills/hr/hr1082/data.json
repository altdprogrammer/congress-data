    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable income tax credit for a portion of the wages paid previously unemployed handicapped Vietnam veterans. Allows the credit for 25 percent of the wages paid individuals who were: (1) employed by the taxpayer not less than six months during the two years previous to the last date of the taxpayer's taxable year; and (2) unemployed since discharge, or for four months prior to employment by the taxpayer. Limits the credit to wages paid for work in jobs certified by the Secretary of Labor as either reflecting the employee's prior experience or education or providing training which leads to self-improvement or job advancement. Limits the employees who may be taken into account for this credit to 30 percent of the taxpayer's labor force. Provides for the carryover (to seven years) or carryback (to three years) of the allowable credit which exceeds the taxpayer's current tax liability."
