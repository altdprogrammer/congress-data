Establishes a separate program under Title IV of Federal assistance for foster care services. Requires each State, in order to receive assistance under such program, to develop a State plan for foster care and adoption services. Requires such State plans to assure that no child shall be placed in foster care unless the child and his family have been provided adequate preventive services designed to avoid unnecessary out-of-home placements or have refused such services. Requires State plans to prohibit the involuntary removal of a child from a home shared with a parent unless there has been a judicial determination that the home situation is dangerous to the child, or the child is in need of supervision or has committed a delinquent offense. Sets forth standards of care which must be established under State plans for foster children. Sets forth the duties of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in connection with the implementation and administration of the provisions of this Act. Establishes a program of \"foster care support payments\" as a form of aid to families with dependent children. Specifies the requirements for eligibility for such payments. Directs the Secretary to appoint a Committee on Uniform Adoption Regulations to propose to the Secretary, the President, and Congress a set of uniform adoption regulations which would facilitate adoption. Directs the Secretary, after appropriate hearings, to promulgate final uniform adoption regulations. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress annually on the adoption and foster care programs conducted pursuant to this Act. Requires each State having a plan approved under this Act to make payments to parents who adopt a child after the date of enactment of this Act. Provides for payments on behalf of foster children under circumstances specified in this Act."
