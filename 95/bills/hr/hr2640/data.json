Provides for the annual certification by the Secretary of Commerce of qualified areas which meet the criteria and purpose of the Public Works and Economic Development Act. Allows the continued exclusion of industrial development bonds excludable before this Act where the bonds were issued or authorized before enactment, or where a governmental unit or other person has made specified types of financial commitments relating to such issues before enactment. Allows national banks to deal in and underwrite industrial development bonds for economic development areas."
