    "text": "Supplemental Security Income Amendments - Repeals the definition of the term \"child\" under Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled) of the Social Security Act which defines a child as an unmarried individual under the age of 18 or a student under the age 22. States that in determining eligibility for, and the amount of benefits under, such Title, in the case of any individual under the age 18, the income and resources of a parent of such individual shall be included in the calculation of the applicant's income. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish an outreach program to assure that all individuals eligible for supplemental security income benefits under such title will be fully informed of the availability and nature of benefits and of the steps to be taken in obtaining them. Authorizes the payment of benefits under such Title directly to a drug addict or an alcoholic who is undergoing treatment when such direct payment, which must now be made directly to the person conducting such treatment, would be of significant therapeutic value to the recipient. Authorizes the continued payment of benefits under such Title to persons who are necessarily absent from the United States to obtain inpatient hospital services. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to exclude from the definition of \"income\", gifts and inheritances which are not readily convertible into cash. Authorizes the payment, to an individual who is presumptively eligible for benefits, and who is faced with a financial emergency, cash advances of the full amount of such benefits for the first three months of presumptive eligibility. Establishes procedures under which the Secretary shall reimburse any State for payments made by the State to an eligible individual to replace a lost, stolen, or undelivered check, or in supplementing to the correct amount any check which is determined to be in an amount less than that for which the individual is eligible. Establishes additional conditions for the termination of State payments in supplementation of Supplemental Security Income benefits. Declares that an individual's eligibility for benefits and the amount of such benefits shall be determined monthly, as opposed to the current requirement of quarterly determinations. Authorizes the payment of full Supplemental Security Income benefits to an eligible individual in specified medical care institutions for the first three months of such individual's hospitalization. Sets forth a schedule of payments for longer periods. Excludes specified assistance payments from the determination of an individual's income in the determination of individual's eligibility for benefits or of the amount of such benefits."
