    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 95-924) Coal Pipeline Act - Authorizes the exercise of the right of eminent domain by any carrier of coal by coal pipeline who holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Department of the Interior. Stipulates that, before issuance of such certificate, environmental considerations and the need for energy domestically shall be weighed before the Secretary of the Interior makes a finding. Requires with certain exceptions that no carrier granted the power of eminent domain under this Act shall transport any coal in which it has any ownership interest. Permits the Secretary under certain circumstances to approve applications for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a coal pipeline which proposes to use underground water for the transportation of coal. Establishes procedures for making application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, for antitrust review, and for enforcement under this Act. Imposes a maximum fine of $10,000, six months imprisonment, or both, for knowing violation of any provision of, or regulation issued pursuant to, this Act. Permits any State in granting a State water permit or authorization to a pipeline, to condition pursuant to State law the water rights of such pipeline. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting in any way any law, regulation or rule of law governing appropriation, use, or diversion of water, or as affecting any Federal, State or private right to water, or as granting a right to the use of water to any carrier, or as superseding or modifying any State law, regulation, or rule of law governing the acquisition and administration of water rights. Requires that all coal pipelines subject to this Act be buried underground, in a manner consistent with environmental protection, safety, and good engineering and technological practices. States that this Act shall not be applicable to coal pipelines in bona fide operation on January 1, 1978."
