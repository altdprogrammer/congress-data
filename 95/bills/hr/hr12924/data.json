    "text": "Increases the amount of group life insurance available to Federal employees. States that such amount shall be the product resulting from the multiplication of the \"basic insurance benefit\" by a factor assigned to an employee's age. Defines the \"basic insurance benefit\" as the higher of $10,000 or the employee's annual rate of basic pay rounded to the next higher multiple of $1,000 plus $2,000. Establishes the age-dependent factor as two times the employee's basic benefit for employees age 35 and under decreasing to a factor of one for employees age 45 and older. Applies the newly established insurance rates to group accidental death and dismemberment insurance. Provides for the deduction from the annuity or compensation of a retired employee of a share of the cost of insurance continued after retirement. Establishes a plan of optional life insurance which shall be in addition to optional life insurance now available to employees. Establishes a plan of optional life insurance without accidental death and dismemberment insurance for the family members of Federal employees. Sets the amount of such insurance at $5,000 for a spouse and $2,500 for each child."
