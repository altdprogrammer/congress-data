Sets a formula for such compensation, requiring the payment of at least $200 per cow. Denies any such compensation with respect to any dairy cow moved or handled by its owner in violation of any law or regulation for the prevention of the dissemination of any communicable disease of livestock for which such cow was destroyed. Title II: Vaccination Program; Research Program - Directs the Secretary to make grants to States for conducting: (1) without charge to farmers or ranchers, a brucellosis vaccination program; and (2) intensive research concerning methods of identifying brucellosis and of improving anti-brucellosis vaccines. Title III: Deferral of Certain Payments on Operating and Emergency Loans Made Under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to require the Secretary to make all principal and interest payments coming due on any operating or emergency loan relating to the dairy operation of a farmer or rancher who owns dairy cattle subject to a quarantine imposed in order to control or eradicate brucellosis. Limits the Secretary's payments to the period of the quarantine and for 60 days thereafter. Requires the farmer or rancher to reimburse the Secretary, without interest, for such payments. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations under this Act, and defines terms used therein."
