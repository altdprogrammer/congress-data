    "text": "Authorizes the Commissioner of Aging, under the Older Americans Act of 1965, to make grants to State agencies, institutions of higher education, private nonprofit organizations and business concerns for the purpose of devising models, preparing information and materials, and providing consultation services and technical assistance in the development and evaluation of preretirement education programs. Allows any such grant to defray 100 percent of the costs of the project involved. Authorizes the appropriation of $8,000,000 for such grants for fiscal year 1978. Directs the Commissioner to carry out studies: (1) to evaluate existing preretirement education programs; and (2) to assess existing and proposed Federal, State and local programs relating to specified kinds of retirement plans which include full-time employment alternatives."
