    "text": "Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require each Congressional committee having jurisdiction to report legislation authorizing appropriations for any Federal program to review such program at least once in every six year period as though it were being proposed for the first time. Limits the period during which authorizations for Federal programs are effective. Directs that each committee review of a Federal program include a consideration of alternative ways of carrying out such activities and alternative funding levels, an evaluation of the costs and benefits of such alternatives, a cost-benefit analysis of the program, and evaluation of its success or failure. Stipulates that all budget authority for any Federal program following such review shall be considered new budget authority. Prohibits either House from considering authorization bills for Federal programs until a report has been submitted by the appropriate committee, or bills authorizing appropriations for such programs for more than six fiscal years. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to require the Committee on the Budget of the House and the Senate to establish guidelines for the various committees of both Houses in carrying out their zero-base budgeting functions."
