    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers to credit against the income tax specified higher education expenses, including tuition, fees, books, and supplies, incurred by the taxpayer for himself or any other individual. Limits the credit to 100 percent of the first $300 for any individual, 50 percent of the next $300, and 10 percent of the next $400. Limits the credit to expenses incurred by full time students at institutions of vocational and higher education, minus scholarships and veterans' benefits. Limits the total credit allowed the taxpayer to his income tax liability minus the sum of all other credits applied thereto. Disallows any deduction of educational expenses used to determine the amount of the credit allowed by this Act."
