    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1620) Amends the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act to raise the maximum license fee for commission merchants, dealers, and brokers from $100 to $150 plus $50 for each branch or additional business location (but not to exceed an annual aggregate of $1,000). Raises from $100,000 to $150,000 the minimum invoice value of specified goods any person must buy or sell or negotiate the sale of in order to be deemed a dealer or broker. Includes as a \"dealer\" any person who buys potatoes for canning and/or processing. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to inspect the accounts, records and memorandums of any commission merchant, dealer, or broker who has violated the provision of such Act requiring prompt full payment in respect of any transaction in any perishable agricultural commodity. Permits the Secretary to require surety bonds as assurance of payment of reparation awards from such merchants, dealers, and brokers. Limits the inspection of any commission merchant, dealer, or broker who furnished such a surety bond to not more than once a year. Allows the Secretary to suspend the license, and/or publish the facts and circumstances, if such merchant, dealer, or broker refuses to permit inspection or fails or refuses to furnish, maintain, or adjust a surety bond."
