Directs the President to submit to Congress a plan for the orderly transfer of duties essential to the public health, safety or welfare from an abolished agency to the President or to a successor agency. Provides that all orders, rules, certificates, judicial proceedings and licenses made effective by agencies abolished by this Act shall continue in effect until repealed or superceded by the President."
