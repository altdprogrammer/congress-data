    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-04-04", 
    "text": "Federal Construction Costs Reduction Act - Raises from $2,000 to $40,000 the dollar value of contracts to which the Davis-Bacon Act (minimum wages on federally-affected construction projects) applies. Directs the Secretary of Labor to increase such threshold level yearly in proportion to the rise in the Consumer Price Index. Makes the Act applicable only to the wages of unskilled laborers. Exempts apprentices, helpers, and trainees from the Act and forbids the Secretary from taking any action which discourages the customary utilization of apprentices, helpers, and trainees. Requires the \"prevailing wage\" (contracts covered by the Act must provide that covered employees are paid at a rate determined by the prevailing wage) to be set at the average wage paid laborers employed on at least three projects similar to the subject project which were carried out in the immediate geographic area during the previous two years. Requires such determination to be made no later than 60 days prior to the opening of invitations for bids for projects covered by the Act. Requires, in lieu of the weekly wage reports presently required by the Act, that in the event there is no evidence that a contractor is violating the Act, such contractor need only submit an affidavit certifying his compliance. States that where evidence of such violation exists, the contractor must submit weekly certified payroll statements and other records required by the Secretary. Establishes a Federal Construction Appeals Board to which any interested party may appeal wage rate determinations or other Labor Department rules likely to have a substantial effect on future wage rate determinations."
