    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Science and Technology with amendment, H. Rept. 95-1177 (Part II)) Chesapeake Bay Research Coordination Act - Establishes in the executive branch an independent Office for Chesapeake Bay Research Coordination. Establishes the Chesapeake Bay Advisory Committee to advise the Director of the Office and to review and evaluate the annual report which the Office is required to make to Congress. Requires such Office, after consultation with the Committee, to: (1) identify duplicative research efforts; (2) identify the need for additional research projects; (3) establish an effective mechanism for coordinating the research projects of the Federal Government with those of State and local government agencies; (4) assist in monitoring ongoing research projects and disseminate results and findings; and (5) exchange information with representatives of government departments, agencies, and independent establishments which administer research projects in the Chesapeake Bay area. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to make available to the Office such administrative services and staff as may be reasonably required. Authorizes to be appropriated to the Office for each of the fiscal years 1979-1981 such sums not to exceed $500,000 to carry out the purposes of this Act. Provides for the termination of the Act and the authorities conferred by the Act three years after the date of enactment. Requires the Secretary of Commerce and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, at such time, to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Office and this Act."
