Requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish procedures to be followed by licensees of broadcasting stations to ascertain the needs, views and interests of the residents of their service areas. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a study to determine how it might expedite the elimination of those regulations of broadcast licenses required by the Communications Act of 1934 which do not serve the public interest and to make annual reports of the results of such study (including any recommendations for legislation) to the Committee on Commerce of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives."
