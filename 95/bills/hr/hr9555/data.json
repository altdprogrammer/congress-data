    "text": "Truth in Lending Simplification Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to exempt transactions involving extensions of credit for agricultural purposes. Defines the finance charge as the sum of all charges imposed upon and payable by the consumer for the extension of credit. Requires the itemizing of finance charges except in the case of the sale of a dwelling or a consumer loan secured by a first lien. Amends the Truth in Lending Act by requiring from both consumer and creditor statements indicating a security interest is taken and general descriptions of any other property which is the subject of or is connected with extension of credit not under an open end credit plan. Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to provide readily understandable model forms and clauses to facilitate compliance with disclosure requirements. States that no civil or criminal liability applies for failure to make disclosure if the creditor utilized these model forms or clauses in good faith. Redefines the disclosure requirements to comply with the provisions of this Act. States that whoever maliciously or in bad faith institutes a civil proceeding under this Act is liable for damages."
