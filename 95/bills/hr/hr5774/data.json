    "text": "Federal Employees' Political Activities Act - Revises provisions prohibiting Federal employees, Postal Service employees, and District of Columbia employees from engaging in political activities. Declares it the policy of Congress that employees should be encouraged to fully exercise, to the extent not expressly prohibited by law, their rights of voluntary participation in the political processes of State and local governments. Continues proscriptions against employees using their official authority or influence to interfere with the result of any election or to coerce the political action of any person. Modifies provisions relating to the solicitation and offering of political contributions by Federal employees. Prohibits employees from: (1) giving or offering to give a political contribution to any individual either to vote or refrain from voting in any election; (2) soliciting or receiving a political contribution to vote or refrain from voting in any election; (3) knowingly giving a political contribution to a superior; (4) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution from another employee with respect to whom such employee is a superior; or (5) knowingly soliciting or receiving a political contribution in specified facilities. Places additional restrictions on specified employees of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency. Prohibits employees from holding, or being a candidate for, any office of a political party or for any elective public office unless such position is a part-time office of a State or political subdivision thereof or is nonpartisan. Prohibits employees, with specified exceptions, form engaging in political activity (1) which entails active campaigning for a candidate or political party in connection with a partisan Federal election, (2) while on duty or while wearing a uniform or official insignia identifying their position, or (3) in designated areas. Establishes the Board on Political Activities of Federal Employees to decide cases regarding violations of this Act. Designates the Civil Service Commission to investigate reports and allegations of prohibited activity. Specifies guidelines for carrying out such investigations. Requires the Commission to give notice to the Board and the employees involved of apparent violations, except when the conduct of specified officials is involved, in which case the Commission is directed to refer the matter to the Attorney General and to report to Congress and the President. Directs the Board to render a final decision on the apparent violation on the basis of the record after a hearing conducted by a hearing examiner, which record shall include the recommended decision of the hearing examiner and any exception to such decision filed by the employee. Grants to the Board specified powers in carrying out its functions. Permits an employee upon whom a penalty is imposed by an order of the Board to seek judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the employee resides or is employed. Specifies penalties for violation of the prohibitions contained in this Act. Directs the Commission to establish and conduct a continuing program to inform all employees of their rights of political participation and to evaluate employees with respect to those activities which are prohibited. Creates a specific criminal offense for extorting political contributions from Federal personnel."
