    "text": "Omnibus Privacy and Media Source Protection Act - Title I: Media Source Protection - Prohibits anybody having power to hold any person in contempt, including any court, grand jury, administrative body of the United States or of any State, legislature of any State, House of Congress, or committee or subcommittee thereof, from (1) requiring any newspaper, magazine, news agency, press association, wire service, radio, or television transmission station or network, or any professional journalist or newscaster associated with any such organization, to disclose any news, or the source of any news, which comes into the possession of such organization or person in the course of gathering news for publication or distribution; or (2) holding any such organization or person in contempt for failing or refusing to disclose any such news or source. Title II: Rights or Privacy of Individual Citizens - Prohibits any person engaged in commerce from distributing, without consent, the name, address, or other information about an individual, which such person has received in the ordinary course of business, to any other person, if the distributor has reason to believe that such person intends to use such information for business solicitation. Establishes criminal penalties and creates a right to an action for damages for violations and allows a United States district court to grant equitable relief. Prohibits the installation or use of any two-way mirror in any place reasonably expected to be frequented by the public, including department stores, fitting rooms, motel rooms, and restrooms, unless an appropriate notice is conspicuously displayed in or near such place. Establishes criminal penalties for violations and allows a United States district court to grant equitable relief. Allows any individual who purchases or contracts to purchase any product or service at a cost of $25 or more from any solicitor at such individual's residence, to cancel such transaction for any reason and without penalty within three business days by providing written notice to such solicitor. Prohibits cancellation in certain instances, including a contracted-for service which has been completely performed. Title III: Telephone Privacy - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any unsolicited commercial telephone call to any telephone if the subscriber for such telephone has notified the telephone company of a desire not to receive such calls. Prohibits any person from causing to be made any unsolicited commercial telephone call which is made entirely by automatic equipment and has or may have a duration of more than one minute. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe appropriate notice regulations. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of this title. Declares that prosecution for such violations must be preceded by receipt of at least ten written complaints within a calendar year by the United States attorney, and such complaints must be made within 14 days of the alleged violation."
