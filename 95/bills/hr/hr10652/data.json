Requires that any social security card issued to an alien contain a notation indicating whether such alien is eligible for employment. Prohibits an employer from hiring an alien without first inspecting such alien's social security card to determine the alien's eligibility for employment. Prohibits the use of social security cards to identify an individual, except as provided in this Act. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of this this Act."
