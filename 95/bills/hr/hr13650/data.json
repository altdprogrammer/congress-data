Requires the person recovering the minerals to pay the cost of recovery and to share the profits with the Secretary, such share not exceeding the total amount paid by the Secretary for carrying out remedial action. Requires such person, after paying such share to the Secretary, to pay a share of the profits, as determined by the Secretary, to the State in which the recovered materials are located. Provides for civil penalties for violation of this Title, any cooperative agreement, or any rule prescribed under this Act. Directs all parties to encourage public participation. Terminates the remedial action program seven years after the EPA standards are promulgated. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, to submit annual reports to Congress concerning the status of actions taken. Directs the Secretary to report by July 1979 to Congress the location of residual radioactive materials or other radioactive wastes. Requires the Secretary to avoid duplication of previous or ongoing studies and to utilize all information available from other departments and agencies of the United States respecting such subject matter in preparing such reports. Directs such agencies to cooperate with the Secretary in preparing such reports and to furnish necessary information. Requires the Administrator, in consultation with the NRC, to report to Congress by Janurary 1, 1980, identifying the location and potential health, safety, and environmental hazards of uranium mine wastes together with recommendations, if any, for a program to eliminate such hazards. Directs the Commission, in cooperation with the Secretary, to ensure that any relevant information, other than trade secrets and other proprietary information otherwise exempted from mandatory disclosure under any other provision of law, obtained from the conduct of each of the remedial actions autorized by this Title and the subsequent perpetual care of those residual radioactive materials is documented systematically, and made publicly available conviently for use. Prohibits any funding for remedial action at active mill tailing sites. Directs the Attorney General to determine the identity and legal responsibility of past owners of the designated processing sites and report to Congress. Directs the Attorney General to take appropriate action to require reimbursement from such past owners. =Title II: Uranium Mill Tailings Licensing and Regulation= - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require that specified licenses issued under such Act for activities resulting in the production of by-product material have terms assuring that prior to termination of such licenses, (1) the licensee shall comply with the Commission's requirements relating to termination, and (2) ownership of by-product materials and their disposal sites shall be transferred without cost to the United States. Directs the Commission to require by rule, regulation, or order that, prior to the termination of any such license issued three years after the enactment of this Act, title to the land, including any interests therein, (other than land owned by the United States or by a State) which is used for the disposal of any by-product material shall be transferred to the United States or the State in which such land is located, at the option of such State, unless the Commission determines that such transfer is not necessary or desirable to protect the public health, safety, or welfare for to minimize or eliminate danger to life or property. Directs the Commission to permit the use of surface or subsurface estates, or both, of such transferred land, providing the person who transferred such land with the right of first refusal of such use, if such use would not endanger the public health, safety, welfare or environment. Directs the Secretary of Energy, or any Federal agency designated by the President, to assume title and custody of such by-product material and land transferred to the United States, maintaining such material and land so as to protect the public health and safety and the environment. Directs States to do likewise in the case of material and land transferred to them. Authorizes the Commission, before the termination of any such license issued prior to three years after the enactment of this Act, to require such transfers to the United States or the appropriate State, as may be necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and the environment. Stipulates that such transfers: (1) shall not relieve any licensee of liability for any fraudulent or negligent prior acts; and (2) shall be carried out without cost, other than administrative or legal costs, to the United States or a State. Exempts lands held in trust for, or owned subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States by, any Indian tribe from such provisions concerning transfers. Requires licensees, in the case of such lands, to enter into arrangements with the NRC to assure long-term maintenance and monitoring by the United States. Authorizes the Commission to terminate or suspend all or any part of its agreement with the State if the State has not complied with any of the requirements of this section. Requires States having authority to regulate by-product materials under an agreement with the Commission to adopt and enforce: (1) standards for the protection of public health and safety from hazards associated with such material; (2) provisions allowing for public notice and public participation in licensing and rulemaking actions; and (3) requirements for the preparation of a written environmental analysis, to be made available to the public prior to approval of any construction activity relating to by-product material, such analysis to include: (a) assessment of the radiological and nonradiological impacts to the public health of the activities to be conducted pursuant to such license; (b) assessment of any impact on any waterway and groundwater resulting from such activities; (c) consideration of alternatives, including alternative sites and engineering methods, to such activites, and (d) consideration of the long-term impacts, including those of decommissioning, decontamination, and reclamation, associated with such activities. Prohibits any major construction prior to compliance with such written environmental impact analysis. Directs the State to transfer to the United States upon termination of a license, any amounts collected by the State from the licensee for reclamation, maintenance and monitoring of the by-product material.
