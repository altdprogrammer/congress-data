    "text": "Prohibits the closure or realignment of military bases involving reductions in personnel positions below a specified level or construction or conversion at military installations made necessary by the relocation of such civilian personnel unless: (1) the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned notifies the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives that such installation is a candidate for closure or realignment; (2) the appropriate Secretary complies with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; (3) the appropriate Secretary notifies the Committees on Armed Services of a final decision in writing regarding such closure or realignment and a detailed justification for such decision; (4) the appropriate Secretary has provided such committees with an impact statement indicating the effect such action would have on the total amount and percentage of total appropriations the Department of Defense expends in the State to be affected; and (5) a period of at least 60 days elapses between such notification and the implementation of such decision. Requires the appropriate Secretary to provide such committees an analysis of the costs expended in such closure or reduction in force which contrasts such costs with those projected prior to such action. Stipulates that this Act does not apply to closure or reductions which the President has certified to Congress as being necessary for reasons of national security or a military emergency."
