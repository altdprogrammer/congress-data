    "text": "Establishes the Aboriginal Hawaiian Claims Settlement Study Commission to study the culture, needs, and concerns of Aboriginal Hawaiians and recommend the means by which the United States may compensate them for injuries arising from its annexation of Hawaii. Provides that nine of the Commission's 15 members shall be of specified degrees of Native blood, and that eight members shall be nominated from a list of suggested members from the Governor of Hawaii. Directs the Commission to report its findings to the Congress and the President within six months of the submission of a draft report required by this resolution. Requires the report's recommendations to include provisions for financial and land compensation that will enhance Aboriginal Hawaiian education and culture, and administrative provisions for the distribution of any remedy. Provides that the Commission's recommendations will be designed to seek a final settlement of Aboriginal Hawaiian claims without creating a wardship or trusteeship or diminishing the Aboriginal Hawaiians status as United States citizens. States that this resolution shall not constitute an extension of jurisdiction or consent to Aboriginal Hawaiians to sue the Government, or a precedent for reopening any past settlement of such claims. Authorizes the appropriation of such funds as necessary for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 in order to carry out the provisions of this resolution."
