Declares it the sense of Congress that the United States not recognize annexation of these states by the Soviet Union, that the President of the United States should request that maps of the Soviet Union indicate that the United States does not recognize such annexation, and that the United Nations should conduct free elections in nations dominated by the Soviet Union."
