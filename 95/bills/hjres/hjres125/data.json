    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Empowers each State to choose electors for President and Vice President equal to the total number of Senators and Representatives the State is entitled to in Congress. Mandates the popular election of electors. Authorizes one elector to be chosen from each electoral district, and two electors to be chosen on a statewide basis. Requires that successor electors are bound to follow the declaration of voting intention that each elector must make. Stipulates that any vote cast by an elector contrary to the declaration made by the elector shall be counted as a vote cast in accordance with his declaration. States that in case of a tie the person having a majority of votes cast by electors from electoral districts shall be President. Directs that in a situation of none receiving such a majority, the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, each having one vote, shall choose the President and Vice President from the top three votegetters. Declares a person constitutionally ineligible to be President ineligible to be Vice President. Directs each State legislature to divide the State into electoral districts equal in size, with the number of districts equaling the State's delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives."
