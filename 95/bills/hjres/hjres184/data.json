Stipulates that it shall be unlawful for any article produced or distributed by such enterprises to be imported into the United States. Requires that such sanctions be enforced by the Secretary of the Treasury, and continue until the foreign enterprise concerned has ceased to engage in commercial whaling. Stipulates that any action by such enterprise to dismantle or convert any vessel used in commercial whaling shall be deemed prima facie evidence that such enterprise has ceased to engage in commercial whaling. Specifies that the sanctions shall continue to apply to any enterprise which transfers whaling equipment to another enterprise engaged in whaling."
