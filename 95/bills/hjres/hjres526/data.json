    "text": "Establishes the Hawaiian Native Claims Settlement Study Commission to study the culture, needs, and concerns of Hawaiian Natives and recommend the means by which the United States may compensate them for injuries arising from its annexation of Hawaii. Provides that six of the Commission's eleven members shall be of specified degrees of Native blood, and that six members shall be nominated from a list of suggested members from the Governor of Hawaii. Directs the Commission to report its findings to the Congress within one year. Requires the report's recommendations to include provisions for financial and land compensation that will enhance Native education and culture, and administrative provisions for the distribution of any remedy. Provides that the Commission's recommendations will be designed to seek a final settlement of Native claims without creating a wardship or trusteeship or diminishing the Natives' status as United States citizens. States that this resolution shall not constitute an extension of jurisdiction or consent to Hawaiian Natives to sue the Government, or a precedent for reopening any past settlement of such claims."
