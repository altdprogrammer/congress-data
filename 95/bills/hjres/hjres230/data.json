    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that the people of the several States, and the District of Columbia, shall elect the President and Vice President. Requires each elector to cast a single vote for two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President. Requires the electors of President and Vice President in each State to have the qualifications requisite for electors of Members of Congress from that State, except that for electors of President and Vice President, the legislature of any State may prescribe less restrictive residence qualifications and for electors of President and Vice President, the Congress may establish uniform residence and age requirements. Provides that the pair of persons having the greatest number of votes for President and Vice President shall be elected, if such number be at least 40 percent of the whole number of votes cast for such offices. Provides that if no pair of persons has such number, a runoff election shall be held in which the choice of President and Vice President shall be made from the two pairs of persons who received the highest numbers of votes. Requires the days for such elections to be determined by Congress and to be uniform throughout the United States. Requires Congress to prescribe by law the time, place, and manner in which the results of such elections shall be ascertained and declared. Grants to each State the authority as to the time and place and manner of holding such elections and entitlement to inclusion or the ballot. Specifies that if, at the time fixed for declaring the results of such elections, the presidential candidate who would have been entitled to election as President has died, the Vice Presidential candidate entitled to election as Vice President shall be declared elected President. Allows Congress to provide for the case of the death, inability, or withdrawal of any candidate for President or Vice President before a President and Vice president have been elected, and for the case of the death of both the President and Vice President elect."
