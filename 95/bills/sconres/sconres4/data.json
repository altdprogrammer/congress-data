Requests the President-elect to extend the program to grant amnesty to all Vietnam-era resisters convicted under such Act, and to each member and former member of the Armed Forces who during the Vietnam era deserted, whether or not he or she was tried and convicted by a court-martial, or was convicted by a court-martial for being absent without leave. Urges the President-elect to upgrade to honorable discharges all general and undesirable discharges issued to former members of the Armed Forces who served during the Vietnam era, and to review on a case-by-case basis every bad conduct and dishonorable discharge to determine whether such discharge should be upgraded."
