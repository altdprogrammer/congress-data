Rept. 95-711) Requires the Administrator of General Services to develop general records schedules specifying periods after which specified Federal agency records must be disposed. States that, with specified exceptions, in the event of a conflict between the period required before destruction specified by the Administrator and the period specified by the head of the agency providing such records, the shorter period shall be required. Makes subject to such destruction schedules all information which appears in the Federal Register and which must be retained by the National Archives, with the exception of Presidential and Executive orders which must be permanently retained. Grants to the Administrator the authority to authorize the disposal of originals of documents in accordance with a disposal schedule submitted by the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register."
