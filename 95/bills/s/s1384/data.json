    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a limited credit against the income tax for contributions of the taxpayer's literary, musical or artistic compositions to certain tax exempt organizations. Limits the credit allowed for any one year to the amount of tax on past gross income attributable to the sale of such compositions. Disallows any credit for letters, memoranda, or similar property relating to the duties of any governmental office held by the taxpayer when they were composed. Limits the credit taken in any taxable year to the greater of $2,500 or 50 percent of the taxpayer's income tax liability for the year. Disallows a credit to the extent that the total value of contribution exceeds $35,000. Allows a five-year carry-over of any credit disallowed by the previous two limitations. Requires that the donee certify to the taxpayer that the contribution is material of literary, artistic or musical significance and its use will be related to the purpose upon which the donee's tax exempt status is based."
