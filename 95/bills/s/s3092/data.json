Rept. 95-1059) Humane methods of Slaughter Act - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to appoint inspectors to examine the methods by which cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines are handled and slaughtered in those establishments which slaughter such animals for commercial use. Authorizes the Secretary to temporarily suspend inspection upon a finding that any livestock has been handled or slaughtered in a method contrary to those specified in the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958. Forbids the importation of meat into the United States unless the livestock from which it was produced was slaughtered by a humane method. Amends the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958 to repeal provisions which confined the required application of humane methods to establishments which sold to the Federal Government. Eliminates the identification procedures and purchasing policies promulgated with such provisions. Stipulates that specified types of religious ritual slaughter are exempt from all provisions of this Act."
