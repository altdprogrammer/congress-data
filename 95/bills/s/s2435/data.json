    "text": "Community Employment Development Act - Title I: Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Amendments - Extends the authorization for appropriations for activities under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Revises the method for determining the maximum allocation of funds under such Act for the Special Federal Responsibilities programs and the Job Corps. Amends the formula for allocating funds for Comprehensive Manpower Services to, among other changes, channel a greater percentage of money to prime sponsors with high unemployment rates and with a high number of low-income persons. Limits eligibility for participation in the public service employment program to persons who (1) have been unemployed for at least 12 weeks, (2) have engaged in intensive job search activities, (3) have had income of 70 percent or less of the low-income level during the three months prior to being employed, and (4) have, where appropriate, been offered search and relocation allowances under the Trade Act of 1974. Revises requirements for sponsor applications for public service employment assistance. Replaces the Emergency Jobs Programs with a Countercyclical Employment Program whose purpose is to provide public service employment for a number of persons equal to 25 percent of the excess of the number of unemployed persons over 4 1/2 percent of the labor force. Sets eligibility standards for public service employment under such program similar to those established under this Act for comprehensive manpower services participation. Title II: Special Impact Youth Amendments - Amends the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to establish a Special Youth Program, through which $10,000,000 is to be provided annually during fiscal years 1979-81 to community development corporations for specified purposes, including payment of wages and allowances to youths who are working or engaging in on-the-job training in community development corporations or their subsidiaries."
