    "text": "Energy Conservation Investment Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make loans to a State to enable the State to carry out an Energy Conservation Investment Program (Program). States that the authority receiving such a loan shall use the proceeds, under such Program, to provide loans to the owners of residential and small commercial buildings for the purpose of retrofitting such buildings in compliance with insulation or other heating system improvement standards as prescribed by this Act. Requires a State, to be eligible for a loan under this Act, to submit a plan to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) for implementing the policy of this Act. Sets guidelines for the appointment of persons to carry out energy auditing responsibilities under this Act. Sets forth duties ascribed to such auditors, including the inspection of buildings covered by this Act and certification of persons installing insulation and heating system improvements. Establishes in the Treasury an energy conservation investment program fund to be used for paying the expenses of carrying out this Act. Allows a State commission to preempt the Federal Power Commission in exercising jurisdiction over the natural gas conserved as a result of this Act."
