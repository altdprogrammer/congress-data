Establishes within the Department of Energy an Office of Small Scale Technology. Requires the Director of such Office to: (1) make grants to small businesses for small scale technology; (2) act to inform small businesses about opportunities for participation in the programs of the Office; (3) evaluate and certify the performance of equipment and demonstration models of grantees; (4) supervise the activities of the National Center for Appropriate Technology; and (5) coordinate Office activities with related activities of other Federal, State, and local agencies. Directs the Office to enter into contractual or other arrangements with the National Center for Appropriate Technology or other groups with similar experience and expertise to perform research and development programs and demonstration projects concerning weatherization oriented small scale technology and to provide grants and other assistance. Transfers all functions of the Energy Related Inventions Program of the National Bureau of Standards and all functions of such Program located within the Department of Energy to the Office. Establishes an Interagency Council on Appropriate Technology as an independent instrumentality of the United States in the Executive branch. Requires the Council to coordinate all small scale technology programs of the Federal Government."
