States that the exclusive remedy for any such claimant shall be a claim against the United States as provided for in this Act. Stipulates that any Indian whose claim to occupancy, possession, or trespass was extinguished by this Act shall have the right to maintain an action against the United States for damages on the grounds that the transfers, when made, were in violation of the laws of the United States. Stipulates that the Court of Claims shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any claim and that a claim shall be barred unless filed within six years from the effective date of this Act."
