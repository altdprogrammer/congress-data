    "text": "Extends the provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 through fiscal year 1982. Eliminates the requirement that eligible households purchase their coupon allotments, reduces benefits, and substitutes for the current itemized deductions allowed in calculating household income a new standard deduction of $100, plus deductions for earned income and a limited amount of child care costs. Disqualifies from participation all students 18 years old or older who are or can be legally claimed as dependents of an ineligible household, and all able-bodied adults between 18 and 60 who, with specified exceptions, fail to register for work or to accept suitable job offers. Limits participation to U.S. citizens and legally admitted permanent resident aliens. States the general procedure for the certification, within 30 days, and the prompt recertification of applicant households. Establishes civil penalties as an alternative to disqualification for retail and wholesale food concerns violating provisions of the Food Stamp Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make research grants to study how to improve the administration and effectiveness of the food stamp program."
