    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-747) Maritime Appropriation Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1978 for: (1) vessel construction and rehabilitation; (2) the payment of obligations incurred for operating-differential subsidy; (3) research and development expenses; (4) reserve fleet expenses; (5) the Merchant Marine Academy; and (6) financial assistance to State marine schools. Requires any liner company receiving operating subsidies to cooperate with the Federal Maritime Commission's investigation of illegal rebating, and to certify that they are not paying any illegal rebates. Makes such provision effective 240 days after enactment of this Act. Amends the Maritime Academy Act of 1958 to increase from $75,000 to $100,000 the annual maintenance and support payments to State Marine Schools. Increases the subsistence allowance to students at the State Marine Schools from $600 to $1,200 per year. Amends the Merchant Marine Act to require annual authorization of appropriations for extension and correspondence courses offered by the Maritime Administration and for other operations and training expenses. Makes ferries operating in point-to-point transportation, weighing less than 75 gross tons, and which are capable of a sustained speed of not less than eight knots, eligible to receive loan guarantees of 87.5 percent, rather than the 75 percent currently provided. Substitutes the Secretary of Commerce for the Federal Maritime Commission for purposes of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. Establishes in the Department of Commerce, in addition to the Assistant Secretaries provided by law as of the date of the enactment of this Act, one additional Assistant Secretary of Commerce who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."
