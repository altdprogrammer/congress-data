Increases the limitation on credit taken for political contributions to $100 ($200 for joint returns), of which no more than $25 (or $50 for joint returns) may be applied to contributions to candidates for the Senate. Denies the alternative income tax deduction for political contributions for contributions to Senate candidates."
