    "text": "Labor Reform Act - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to increase the size of the National Labor Relations Board to seven members and the terms of Board members to seven years. Revises Board quorum requirements to reflect such increased membership. Directs the Board to establish procedures pursuant to which a quorum of a designated three-member group may summarily affirm a decision of an administrative law judge regarding an alleged unfair labor practice. Revises criteria for organizations which may represent guards to allow designation of an organization which represents nonguard employees of other employers. Sets forth procedures for expedited selection of bargaining representatives where an employee, group of employees, or representatives thereof file a petition stating that (1) a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit have designated a representative which the employer refuses to recognize and (2) there is no representative currently certified or recognized with respect to any employees in the bargaining unit. Denies, for a three-year period unless there is no alternative source, public contracts to persons willfully violating final orders regarding unfair labor practices. Specifies damages available to employees when (1) there is employer discrimination based on union membership resulting in deprivation of employment during certain periods or (2) there is an unlawful refusal to bargain prior to entry into a first bargaining contract."
