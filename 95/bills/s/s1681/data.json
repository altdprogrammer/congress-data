Requires each broadcasting station licensee to file an annual report with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on how the operation of the station has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity during the preceding year. Directs the FCC to review its rules relating to the broadcast license renewal process to determine whether the paper work required of each licensee can be reduced and consolidated."
