Directs the Commission to consider the recommendation of the Advisory committee on Reactor Safeguards before authorizing any regulatory research on reactor safety. Provides for a reduction in the authorization by $2,700,000, if the license application is withdrawn or the construction of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor is not authorized. Provides for a reduction in the authorization by $2,100,000, if the license application is withdrawn or further construction is cancelled for the fuel reprocessing plant at Barnwell, South Carolina. Directs the Commission to report to Congress on a quarterly basis concerning the hiring and promotion procedures for employees at or above the level of GS-11. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to direct the Commission to develop and implement a plan for the correction of unresolved safety issues relating to nuclear reactors. Amends the Atomic Energy Act to establish a fellowship program to study reactor safety research. Directs the Commission to promulgate standards on conflicts of interest in dealing with contractors. Authorizes the transfer of sums from salaries and expenses to other agencies of the Government for the performance of the work for which the appropriation is made."
