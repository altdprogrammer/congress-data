R. 6693 passed in lieu) Adoption Reform Act - =Title I: Adoption Opportunities= - Makes it the purpose of this Act to facilitate the elimination of obstacles to adoption and facilitate the placement in permanent adoptive homes of children, particularly children with special needs, by: (1) promoting the establishment of model adoption legislation in the States and territories of the United States in order to eliminate jurisdictional and legal obstacles to adoption; and (2) providing a mechanism for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to: (A) promote equality standards for adoption services (including pre-placement, post-placement, and post-adoption counseling and standards to protect the rights of children in need of adoption) and (B) provide for a national adoption information exchange system. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act to issue proposed model adopted legislation and procedures. Directs the Secretary to appoint a panel to: (1) review current conditions, practices, and laws relating to adoption, with special reference to their effect on facilitating or impeding the finding of suitable homes for adoptions; and (2) propose to the Secretary model adoption legislation which would facilitate adoption. Directs the Secretary to encourage and facilitate the enactment of comprehensive adoption assistance legislation in each State. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an administrative arrangement in order to: (1) establish a national adoption data gathering system; (2) conduct a continuing adoption education program, including the making of grants, and the publishing of materials regarding adoption and adoption assistance programs; (3) provide for the operation of a national adoption information exchange system, and the coordination of such system with similar State and regional systems; (4) assistance in the planning and carrying out of adoption programs; and (5) coordinate and consult with other appropriate Federal departments and agencies with respect to services and benefits provided under this Act. Directs the Secretary to study the nature, scope, and effects of the interstate placement of children in adoptive homes by persons or agencies which are neither licensed nor subject to government regulation. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the results of such study within 18 months after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 1978 and such sums as may be necessary for the succeeding three years. =Title II: Amendments to Child Abuse Prevention Treatment Act= - Extends the appropriations authorization of such Act for a two-year period, through fiscal year 1979. Directs that special consideration be given to continued funding of national or regional child abuse and neglect programs. Authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1979, for grants and contracts for programs and projects designed to prevent, identify, and treat sexual abuse of children. Requires the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect to: (1) prepare a comprehensive plan to bring about maximum coordination of the goals of all agencies with responsibilities with respect to child abuse and neglect; and (2) submit such plan to the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires States to obligate funds awarded under the Act within 18 months after the award is made, or suffer a deduction of subsequent grants in the amount of the unobligated funds. Requires that at least three of the members of the Advisory Board have backgrounds in the field of child abuse and neglect."
