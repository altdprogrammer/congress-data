    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit a credit against tax equalling ten percent of the expenditures in rehabilitating residential, commercial, and industrial structures which are at least 20 years old and have a useful life of five years or more. Limits the allowable credit to $2,000 in any taxable year. Requires that expenditures for rehabilitation exceed $3,000 over a period of two consecutive years. Permits a carryback and carryover of the credit to other years if ten percent of the expenditures for rehabilitation in any taxable year exceeds $2,000. Increases the tax liability of a non-residential owner of a rehabilitated structure who sells such structure by the amount of the credit allowed for rehabilitation in the taxable year of the sale and the prior two taxable years."
