Conditions implementation of such programs upon the establishment of adequate safeguards which preclude such households from simultaneously participating in both the food stamp and the commodity distribution programs. Applies the benefits and requirements of the food stamp program to Indian tribes generally. Permits members of a participating tribe or Indian community to buy hunting and fishing equipment, for purposes of procuring food, with food coupons. Permits the official governing body of any Indian tribe to request the Secretary to let it administer the food stamp program, or to designate a tribally authorized intertribal organization, or the State agency, to administer such program. Requires the Secretary to pay any tribe or tribally authorized intertribal organization or to reimburse any State agency, 100 percent of the costs necessary to administer such a program on behalf of the members of an Indian tribe."
