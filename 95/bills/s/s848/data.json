Requires each work of improvement project to contain benefits directly related to agriculture that account for at least 20 percent of the total benefits of such project. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Soil Conservation Service, to report by September 30, 1078 to the appropriate Congressional committees on the feasibility, the desirability, and the public interest involved in requiring full public access to all federally authorized water impoundments with recreation-related features."
