Authorizes the assessment of a civil money penalty of $100 per day for each violation of such Act relating to reserve requirements and the amount of interest which may be paid on deposits at member banks.

Provides that, when aggregated, such insider loans may not (1) exceed the limitations provided for single borrowers for national banks or the limitations for State member banks or insured non-member banks, or (2) exceed $25,000, unless such loan is approved by two-thirds of the board of directors with the interested party abstaining from the voting. Forbids such insider loans unless they are made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act to authorize the Board to require the divestiture of a non-bank subsidiary of a holding company, not a subsidiary of a bank, or the termination of such non-bank activities wherever there is reasonable cause to believe that such subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a bank holding company's subsidiary bank and is inconsistent with sound banking principles or with the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act or with the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), whenever it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of any activity or of ownership or control of any of its non-insured subsidiaries, constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary insured institution or institutions, to order the savings and loan holding company or any of its non-insured subsidiaries to terminate such activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any such subsidiary. Authorizes the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to make contributions to insured savings and loan associations in distress. Authorizes the assessment of a civil money penalty for any violation of a provision of the Bank Holding Company Act. Authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to issue subpoenas in connection with hearings or investigations under the Bank Holding Company Act. Provides that any company which violates or any individual who participates in a violation of any provision of the National Housing Act dealing with regulation of holding companies shall pay a civil penalty for each day such violation continues. Authorizes cease and desist proceedings and cease and desist orders and temporary cease and desist orders to be issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the National Housing Act (for the FSLIC), the Home Owners' Loan Act (for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board), and the Federal Credit Union Act, directly against any director, officer, employee, agent, or any other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of a bank or a savings and loan institution. Authorizes the issuance under such Acts of an order to any director, officer or other person participating in the affairs of a bank or a savings and loan institution removing any such person from office or from participating in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of a bank upon a showing that such individual has exhibited personal dishonesty in a transaction or has demonstrated gross negligence in the operation or management of the bank or a willful disregard for the safety or soundness of the bank. Authorizes the assessment of civil money penalties of not more than $1,000 per day violation of any outstanding cease-and-desist or removal order under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act. Provides that any insured institution, savings and loan, or any institution the accounts of which are insured which violated, or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of an institution who violates a cease-and-desist order which has become final, shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 per day per violation for each day during which such violation continues. Makes applicable to insured non-member banks the requirements of the Federal Reserve Act relating to limitation loans and credit insiders. Authorizes civil money penalties to be assessed against insured non-member banks to the same extent as civil money penalties may be assessed against member banks. Increases the limits on loans which may be made by a member bank to its executive officers. Requires the appropriate regulatory agency to provide the opportunity for a hearing to an insured bank official suspended or removed because of an indictment or conviction for a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust which carries a penalty of imprisonment in order to effectuate such suspension or removal, for a term exceeding one year. Requires such agency, to find that continued service by such individuals may pose a threat to the interests of the bank's depositors, or may threaten to impair public confidence in the bank. Authorizes a bank holding company to retain shares in a bank acquired in connection with defaults on debts previously contracted for a period of five years. Provides that a company acquiring such shares would not be required to be registered as a bank holding company for five years. =Title II: Interlocking Directors= - Depositary Institution Management Interlocks Act - Prohibits a management official of a depositary institution from serving as a management official of another depositary institution, not affiliated with the former institution, in the same standard metropolitan statistical area or in the same or adjacent city or town. Prohibits all interlocking management relationships regardless of geographic location between a depositary institution with $1,000,000,000 in assets and another such institution with $500,000,000 in assets. Exempts from this title: (1) failing depositary institutions; (2) Edge Act Corporations; (3) credit unions; and (4) depositary institutions doing only incidental business in the United States or any of its territories. Provides a \"grandfather clause\" for existing interlocking relationships for a period of ten years.

Makes the performance of certain clerical services for federally regulated banks subject to Federal regulations and examination to the same extent as if they were performed by the bank itself. =Title IV: Conflicts of Interest= - Depository Institutions Conflict of Interest Act - Prohibits the members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the Comptroller of the Currency from taking jobs with banks or bank holding companies of banks they regulate for two years upon leaving office, unless such member has completed the full term for which he was appointed. =Title V: Credit Union Restructuring= - Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to establish an independent agency in the executive branch to be known as the National Credit Union Administration.
