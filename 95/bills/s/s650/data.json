Permits a producer, under such program, to designate a portion of the wheat acreage allotment for the farm, not to exceed 40 percent of the wheat acreage allotment, which shall be available for use by the producer for grazing purposes or hay production. Directs the Secretary to pay a participant an amount determined by multiplying the projected yield for wheat established for the farm times the number of acres included in the special program times $1.00. States that participating producers shall be ineligible for price support on the portion of an acreage allotment so used. Deems acreage included in the special program to have been planted for harvest for purposes of wheat acreage history. Directs the Secretary to carry out the special program through the Commodity Credit Corporation."
