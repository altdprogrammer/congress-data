    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Defense Production Act Amendments - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to prohibit any Federal acquisitions officer who receives compensation at the GS-11 level or greater by virtue of his position is authorized to solicit or select sources of supply, or describe requirements for, enter into, award, modify, terminate, administer, or make determinations or findings with respect to any contract in excess of $25,000 while so employed, from accepting compensation from any contractor receiving funds under such contract for a period of two years following employment with the United States, the independent agencies thereof, or the District of Columbia. Exempts those duties performed by an acquisition officer more than three years before the termination of such officer's employment. Exempts from the provisions of this Act those officers whose employment with an executive agency terminated prior to the effective date of this Act or who is voluntarily separated from the civil service. Makes it a felony and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to coordinate and review the administration and implementation of this Act. Authorizes the Commission, upon application of a former Government procurement official, to advise such individual on the applicability of this Act to such official. Authorizes the Commission to issue an advisory opinion whether certain proposed compensation or employment would violate the intent of this Act. Grants the Civil Service Commission authority to convene hearings, issue subpenas, and take testimony pursuant to a review of an application for advisory opinion. Authorizes the Civil Service Commission to review the status and enforcement of provisions relating to the conduct of Government employees, and recommend additional legislation to the Congress. Requires the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to promptly report to the Attorney General, and to provide such assistance as may be required, whenever he shall learn of an action which appears to involve a violation of this title or any other Federal law. Requires the Attorney General to report to the Chairman and to the Congress on the disposition of any such case."
