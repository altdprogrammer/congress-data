    "text": "Employment Resources Act - Title I: Employment Resources Program - Amends the Employment Act of 1946 to state that it is the policy of the Federal Government to provide work opportunities to all able adult Americans and to promote economic expansion at a rate designed to reduce unemployment in the United States by one-and-one-half percent each year. Directs the President, to design policies so as to assure that the unemployment rate does not exceed five percent by the end of 1978. Requires that the Economic Report annually transmitted by the President pursuant to the Employment Act set forth the level and composition of Federal expenditures, tax policy, and monetary policy consistent with, and in promotion of, the goals and policies contained in this Act. Directs the Federal Reserve Board to report to the President and Congress on the extent to which its intended policies will support those of this Act. Directs the President, upon determining that the policies of the Board are inconsistent with this Act, to make recommendations to the Board and Congress to insure closer conformity. Requires that the Economic Report also include a comprehensive set of anti-inflation programs. Directs the President to develop proposals to strengthen provisions of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 relating to public service employment of long-term unemployed persons. Authorizes the President to establish experimental programs to provide sheltered or supported work for individuals with special employment problems, particularly ex-criminal offenders, drug addicts, severely handicapped individuals, school dropouts, and the mentally ill. Directs the Secretary of Labor to develop programs and projects for elderly persons forced to retire and for women in the home who require part-time employment. Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a National Occupational Assessment Center, which is authorized to conduct a continuing assessment of employment and the need for new occupations and to supervise, at the request of the President, such projects and activities as will contribute to the identification of new career fields and new occupations. Establishes the office of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Affairs. States that the Assistant Secretary shall be responsible for all employment and training programs relating to veterans. Title II: Youth Employment Program - Establishes within the Department of Labor a Youth Employment Agency. Directs such Agency to make grants to, and to enter into contracts with, eligible governmental agencies and private institutions to pay the costs of community service programs to be carried out by youths who either: (1) reside with a family with an income less than the lower living standard budget; or (2) if not living at home, have an income less than the lower living standard budget and do not attend school on more than a half-time basis. Lists assurances regarding projects and working conditions which grant applicants must make in order to receive funds. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Agency, to conduct demonstration projects with eligible applicants under which wage supplements are paid on behalf of youths employed pursuant to the program established in this title. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Agency: (1) to develop improved counseling and placement services for youth; (2) to review and recommend changes in the manpower programs designed to assist youths under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973; and (3) to develop, in cooperation with private business concerns, employment opportunities for youth. Establishes in the United States Employment Service of the Department of Labor a Youth Employment Service. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Service, to make grants to State employment services to establish youth employment guidance and job placement programs. Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to direct the Secretary to encourage State and local governments to eliminate provisions of law and regulations that are unnecessary and prohibit or inhibit ex-criminal offenders from obtaining gainful employment. Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to require the Director of ACTION to encourage the use of youth volunteers in the VISTA program and to take steps to assure that each such youth volunteer is provided with an individual plan designed to furnish an opportunity job advancement or for transition to a situation leading to gainful employment. Amends the Act which established the Youth Conservation Corps to direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to jointly extend the Youth Conservation Corps so as to make possible the year-round employment of young adults. States that individuals employed as Corps members under this Act shall be either between the ages of 18 and 24 exclusively or school dropouts who are at least age 16; shall meet applicable physical standards; shall be given preference for employment if they reside in counties in which the unemployment rate was equal to or in excess of six percent for three consecutive months; and may be employed for a total of not more than 12 months. Specifies guidelines to be followed by the Secretaries in administering this Act, including those relative to the types of jobs and projects to be given preference and the wages to be paid Corps members. Extends the program under which grants are made to States to assist them in meeting the cost of projects for the employment of young people to develop and maintain non-Federal public lands and waters. Designates a time period during which the Secretaries are to develop a plan to carry out the activities authorized by this Act and prepare the site location, facilities, and equipment selected in such plan. Directs the Secretaries, in performing such functions, to plan for a capacity of the extended Corps to employ 100,000 young adults during the first fiscal year of operation, 200,000 during the second, and 300,000 during the third."
