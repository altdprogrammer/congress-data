    "text": "(Reported jointly to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs & Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1143) Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act - Requires the Civil Service Commission to develop a three-year comprehensive plan to provide for the establishment of flexible and compressed work schedule experiments within executive agencies. Permits the head of an agency to request an exemption from the program if such individual determines that the program would substantially disrupt the agency's functions. Provides that the Commission may grant such exemption only if it finds that the program would not be in the best interest of the public, the Government, or the employees. =Title I: Flexible Scheduling of Work Hours= - Permits Federal agencies to conduct experiments to test flexible schedules which include: (1) designated hours and days during which an employee on such a schedule must be present for work; and (2) designated hours during which employees on such a schedule may elect the times of their arrival and departure. Empowers the head of an agency, at the request of an employee participating in a flexible hour program, to grant such employee compensatory time off in lieu of payment of such overtime hours. Disallows, with specified exceptions, the payment of premium pay for night-work to an employee working a flexible hour schedule solely because such employee elects to work optional hours at a time of day for which premium pay is otherwise authorized. Limits the number of optional hours which an employee on a flexible schedule may accumulate for carryover from a biweekly pay period to the succeeding biweekly pay period. =Title II: Four-day Week and Other Compressed Work Schedules= - Permits agencies to conduct experiments to test a four-day workweek or other compressed schedules. Provides protections for employees when a majority of employees in a unit do not wish to participate in an experiment, or when participation would impose a personal hardship. Details provisions relating to the payment of overtime pay, Sunday pay, and holiday pay to individuals working such a schedule. =Title III: Administrative Provisions= - Prohibits the inclusion within any experiment under Titles I or II of this Act of employees within a unit with respect to which an organization of government employees has been accorded exclusive recognition except to the extent expressly provided under a written agreement between the agency and such organization. Prohibits the intimidation or coercion of other employees who are participating in an experiment under Titles I or II with respect to their rights under this Act. Sets forth reporting requirements for the Commission with respect to programs carried out under this Act. Provides that the Act shall become effective on the 180th day after the date of enactment or October 1, 1978, whichever is later. =Title IV: Adjustment of Work Schedules for Religious Observances= - Requires the Commission to prescribe regulations permitting an employee whose religious beliefs require abstention from work during certain periods to elect to engage in overtime work for time lost. Stipulates that employees who elect such overtime work shall be granted equal compensatory time off from his or her scheduled tour of duty (in lieu of overtime pay) for such religious reasons."
