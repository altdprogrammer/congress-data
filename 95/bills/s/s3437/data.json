Title II: Illegal Export of Cash - Amends the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act to require filing of a report prior to departure from the United States or arrival in the United States of any transport of monetary instruments in a amount exceeding $5,000. Authorizes any officer of Customs to conduct a search without warrant when exigent circumstances prevent his obtaining one, if he has probable cause to believe that monetary instruments are in the process of transportation with a false or no report filed. Title III: Prompt Reporting of Vessels - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the immediate report at the nearest customhouse or other prescribed place of the arrival of any foreign vessel, or any vessel of the United States carrying bonded merchandise, or foreign merchandise for which entry has not been made."
