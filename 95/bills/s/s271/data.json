    "text": "Natural Gas Emergency and Conservation Act - Amends the Natural Gas Act to direct the Federal Power Commission to temporarily exempt from regulation sales and deliveries of natural gas where necessary to meet the requirements of high-priority consumers subject to a curtailment plan on file with the commission. Stipulates that such exemptions shall be for periods of no more than 180 consecutive days. Amends the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to authorize the Federal Energy Administrator to prohibit powerplants or major fuel-burning installations from using natural gas where adequate alternatives exist. Stipulates that such orders shall not become effective until the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has certified that such plants will comply with the Clean Air Act. Stipulates that authority to issue such orders shall terminate on September 30, 1980. Directs the Federal Energy Administrator in conjunction with the Federal Power Commission, to submit to Congress a national plan to prohibit or discourage use of natural gas to the maximum extent possible. Establishes the objective of eliminating all nonessential uses of natural gas by January 1, 1985. Requires that such plan include a study of the effects of a prohibition of boiler fuel use of natural gas. Stipulates that the authority of the President to allocate propane and butane under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 shall remain in effect until April 4, 1978. Stipulates that emergency purchases of natural gas supplies by curtailed high priority consumers of natural gas shall be exempt from regulation under the Natural Gas Act."
