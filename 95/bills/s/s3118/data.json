    "text": "Smoking Deterence Act - Prohibits smoking in any enclosed area open to the public in any Federal facility or in any stairway, elevator, hallway, conveyance, waiting room, reception room, conference room, or hearing room in any facility. Requires smokers to be effectively separated from nonsmokers in any restaurant, cafeteria, snackbar, or lounge in any Federal facility. Requires each instrumentality of the United States: (1) to use reasonable efforts to effectively separate the workplaces of its employees who do not smoke and who wish to be so separated from the workplaces of its employees who do smoke; and (2) to insure the effective separation of smoking and nonsmoking employees in planning, designing, purchasing, leasing, or otherwise obtaining new facilities. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to impose a health protection tax on every cigarette manufactured in or imported into the United States based on the number of toxic units, as defined in the Act, contained in the cigarette. Authorizes the appropriation of those amounts received from such taxes to provide preventive health services under the Public Health Service Act. Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to prohibit the manufacture, importation, or packaging for sale or distribution of any cigarettes: (1) if the package fails to bear the tar and nicotine content stated in milligrams; and (2) if the package fails to bear one of a number of specified statements. Requires the Secretary to establish a comprehensive program to deter smoking among children and adolescents. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of: (1) the relative risks associated with smoking cigarettes of varying levels of tar and nicotine; and (2) the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes containing any substances commonly added to commercially manufactured cigarettes."
