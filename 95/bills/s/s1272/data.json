    "text": "National Food Stamp Reform Act for the Elderly - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1964 to permit recipients of social security, supplemental security income, or unemployment compensation benefits to apply for food stamps and be certified for eligibility at social security or unemployment compensation offices. Requires certification, subject to change-of-income conditions, for a period of one year for households containing one or more elderly persons but no wage earners. Eliminates charges for food stamps and replaces \"authorization to purchase\" cards with \"issuance authorization\" cards."
