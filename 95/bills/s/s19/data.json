Limits the marketing activities of a person who is a major market shareholder, as such term is defined in this Act, prohibiting the establishment of new distributorships or retail outlets the personnel of which are under the control of such person or under the control of an entity controlled by such person if such activity would yield to such shareholder a specified share of the market for petroleum products. Sets forth procedural and jurisdictional requirements for suits brought as result of violation of this Act."
