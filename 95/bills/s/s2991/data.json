Requires the Secretary to reimburse participating school districts for all costs in excess of normal school lunch program costs. Requires the Secretary to conduct, and report to Congress on, a continuing evaluation of such projects, including the amount of money which local school districts would save through a permanent free school lunch program. Authorizes such appropriations as may be necessary for fiscal year 1979, and $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1980 and 1981."
