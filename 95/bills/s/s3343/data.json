    "text": "Title I: Office of Nuclear Waste - Declares that the purposes of this Act are to designate the Department of Energy as the lead agency in nuclear waste management; to centralize nuclear waste management responsibility in a new Office of Nuclear Waste within the Department; to set specific procedures and deadlines for establishing and implementing a comprehensive nuclear waste policy; and to clarify and coordinate the policymaking roles of other concerned agencies by establishing a Nuclear Waste Review Panel. Establishes an Office of Nuclear Waste within the Department of Energy, to be responsible, among other things, for: (1) all research, development, and demonstration activities pertaining to nuclear waste; (2) design, construction, operation, and perpetual care of temporary and permanent high-level nuclear waste repositories; (3) administering the Nuclear Waste Management Fund; (4) establishing a system of user fees to cover costs incurred by the Fund; and (5) establishing a nuclear waste plan. Establishes a Nuclear Waste Review Panel to coordinate the nuclear waste policies and actions of its members, including designated Federal agencies and others, as the Chairman of the Panel may require. Directs this Panel to submit to the Congress an annual report of its activities. Title II: Nuclear Waste Planning - Requires the Office of Nuclear Waste to submit to the Congress a nuclear waste plan, to include: (1) programs for research, development, and demonstration of nuclear waste disposal methods; (2) siting, construction, and operation of pilot or experimental nuclear waste facilities; (3) construction and operation of a permanent nuclear waste repository; (4) provisions for implementation of the Nuclear Waste Management Fund; and (5) identification of all environmental impact statements to be issued in connection with the establishment of facilities proposed under this title. Directs the Office to submit to the Congress an annual nuclear waste report. Directs the Office to submit to the Congress a plan: (1) defining the need for additional low-level waste sites and for remedial action, if necessary, at existing low-level facilities; (2) estimating the costs and describing procedures for disposing of uranium mill tailings at sites no longer used or licensed for uranium milling activities; and (3) providing for additional research and development work. Directs the Chairman of the Panel and the Director of the Office to implement procedures for allowing public and State participation in nuclear waste planning activities. Requires the Director to notify the Governor of any State of the Office's proposal to select that State as a site for a study area or facility authorized by this Act. Directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish standards and criteria for assessing the public health and safety aspects of nuclear waste plans prepared pursuant to this Act. Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall: (1) affect the licensing and regulatory authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974; (2) exempt the Office from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act; (3) affect the authority of States to inspect nuclear facilities pursuant to State law or the Atomic Energy Act. Title III: Nuclear Waste Management Fund - Establishes in the Treasury of the United States a Nuclear Waste Management Fund to furnish financial assistance for nuclear waste management. Authorizes the Director to prescribe and impose fees and charges for services rendered by the Office pursuant to this Act, based on reasonably expected costs for waste disposal, research, development, demonstration, and planning. Specifies that the Fund shall consist of deposits of such fees and charges, income and gain realized from investment of excess funds of the Fund, and advances or loans from the Treasury. Directs the Office to assume title to any existing waste facility not presently under United States ownership upon payment of just compensation to States which own such facilities. Authorizes appropriations necessary to implement the Fund and for such other purposes as the Director may determine, such sums to be repaid pursuant to the provisions of this title."
