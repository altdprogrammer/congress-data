    "text": "Uranium Miners' Compensation Act - Requires claims for benefits for death or total disability due to lung disease as a result of employment in a uranium mine to be filed pursuant to State workmen's compensation law. Provides that such claims may be filed pursuant to this Act when a State workmen's compensation law does not provide adequate coverage for such lung disease. Directs the Secretary of Labor to publish in the Federal Register a list of State workmen's compensation laws which do not provide adequate coverage. Requires any claim for benefits under this Act to be filed within three years of the discovery of total disability due to lung disease in a uranium mine or in the case of death, the date of such death. Requires uranium mine operators, in States included on the list, to secure the payment of benefits for which such operator is liable by qualifying as a self-insurer, or insuring the payment of benefits with any stock company or mutual company. Sets forth requirements to be included in such insurance policies. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to initiate research within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and authorizes the Secretary to make research grants, relating to lung disease in uranium mines. Prohibits discrimination against any worker by a mine operator due to such miner suffering from such lung disease. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
