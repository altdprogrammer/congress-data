Prohibits reducing the frequency of mail delivery service below the frequency which was in effect on April 21, 1977. Prohibits the closing between March 15, 1977, and December 31, 1979 of specified post offices regularly serving 35 or more families. Permits the closing of smaller post offices during such period only with the written consent of 60 percent of the regular postal patrons at least 18 years of age."
