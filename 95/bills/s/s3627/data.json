    "text": "Title I: Policy - Declares the purpose of this Act to be: (1) to establish and maintain a Federal policy for the use and management of the results of federally sponsored science and technology research and development programs; and (2) to monitor the impact of such programs on innovation and technology development. Title II: Allocation of Rights-Government Contractors - Requires each Federal agency head to acquire on behalf of the United States, title to any invention made or conceived in the course of any contract if it is determined that: (1) the Government intends to take steps to achieve practical applications of any such inventions; (2) the contract's principal purpose is to develop products, processes, or methods intended for general public use; (3) the contractor's services are for the operation of a Government-owned research or production facility; (4) Government retention of title is necessary for the adequate protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; (5) the Government has been the principal developer in a particular field of science and technology, and acquisition of exclusive rights at the time of contracting might confer on the contractor a preferred or dominant position; (6) the work performed under the contract is of a classified nature; or (7) the commercial interests of the contractor are not sufficiently established. Authorizes an agency head to waive all or any part of the right of the United States to an invention if it is in the interest of the Government and the general public. Reserves to the contractor the option of acquiring title to any invention in all other situations. Provides that if a contractor has acquired title to an invention the Federal agency may, in the interest of public safety or specified economic needs, require the contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license to a responsible applicant. Title III: Allocation of Rights-Federal Employees - Directs the Government to obtain entire right, title, and interest in and to any invention made by a Federal employee if the agency head determines that the invention was conceived in the normal course of employment duties, unless the Government's interest in such invention is negligible. Provides for a review by the Federal Science and Technology Research and Development Utilization Review Board, if requested, for determination as the right of title. Authorizes incentive awards to Federal employee-inventors for any inventions of significant value. Title IV: Federal Technology Utilization Program - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, to establish a program to assure the utilization and protection of patents or other rights in Government-owned inventions. Directs each Federal agency to develop and implement programs for the transfer of Government-owned innovative technology for application and use in industry, agriculture, medicine, transportation, and other critical sectors of the economy. Title V: Federal Review Board - Establishes a Federal Science and Technology Research and Development Utilization Review Board to coordinate, direct, and review Federal policy concerning the ownership of inventions resulting from federally sponsored research and development. Title VI: Miscellaneous - Repeals certain existing statutory authorizations to conform to the provisions of this Act. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to direct the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish an Inventions and Contributions Board to hear, and make findings and recommendations with respect to, every proposal for any waiver of patent rights held by the Administrator. Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act."
