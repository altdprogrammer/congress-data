Prohibits the courts of the United States and State courts from upholding the validity of a challenged rule or regulation unless such validity is clearly and convincingly shown. Provides that if any rule or regulation is set up as a defense to any criminal prosecution or action for civil penalty, such rule or regulation shall be presumed valid until the party initiating the criminal prosecution or action for civil penalty shall have sustained the burden of proof normally applicable in such actions."
