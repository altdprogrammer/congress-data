    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to extend its authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1981. Provides that the chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advise and consent of the Senate. Directs the Commission to specify the period of time in which it or the offeror will develop a proposed regulation. Sets forth a new standard-setting procedure for the development of a consumer product safety standard. Lists specific criteria under which the Commission may proceed (in the place of an offeror of a safety standard) with the development of a standard. Requires the Commission to comply with the same regulations concerning notice, opportunity for participation by interested parties, and detailed recordkeeping, that are required when an outside offeror develops a standard. Specifies that the reasons for not publishing a proposed consumer product safety standard, which the Commission is required to publish in the Federal Register, may include a statement that the Commission is considering other approaches, including a voluntary consumer safety standard adopted by persons who would be subject to such standard. Permits the Commission, upon the determination that an existing standard would eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risk of injury associated with a product, to publish such existing standard, in whole or in part, or a combination of standards, as a proposed consumer product safety rule. Requires exporters to give the Commission advance notice of the shipment of any product which does not conform with an applicable safety standard in effect under this Act or is declared to be a banned hazardous substance under provisions of this Act. Amends the Federal Hazardous Substances Act to allow the Commission to use a closed cup test in determining the flammability of a substance. Directs the Commission to establish a Toxicological Advisory Board to advise the Commission on precautionary labeling for hazardous substances. Requires the Commission to conduct a study of the rules which the Commission has issued and report to Congress within 18 months on such study. Specifies the material to be covered by such study, including the economic, paperwork, and judicial impact of each rule."
