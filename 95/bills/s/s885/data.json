Stipulates that such boundary shall be reduced to a line equidistant between the United States and a foreign nation where such line of equidistance between the two countries is less than 200 miles. Authorizes the Attorney General to initiate class actions to recover private claims arising from discharges of oil and hazardous substances. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act as trustee of the natural resources of the navigable waters in recovering damages caused by oil or hazardous substances in accordance with prescribed criteria in assessing the amount of such damages."
