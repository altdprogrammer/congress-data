    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Interim Regulatory Reform Act - Federal Communications Commission - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission to submit to the Congress a proposal setting forth a recodification of all the rules which the Commission has issued and which are presently in effect or proposed. Requires the Commission to submit with each recodification proposal economic, paperwork, and judicial impact analyses of the probable consequences of each rule proposed to be recodified. Requires that each recodification proposal be published in the Federal Register. Requires the Commission to either grant or deny petitions from persons for the commencement of proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any order, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Commission within 120 days after the receipt of such petition. Stipulates that if such a petition is denied or no action is taken on such petition within the 120 day period the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register its reasons for such denial or inaction. States that if the Commission fails to act or denies a petition the petitioner may commence a civil action in an appropriate United States Court of Appeals for an order directing the Commission to institute proceedings regarding such petition. Sets forth standards for the Court to follow regarding such civil actions. Requires the Commission, when submitting any budget estimates, requests, or information or any legislative recommendations, testimony or comments on legislation to the President or the Office of Management and Budget, to transmit a copy to the Congress. Directs the Commission, whenever a duly authorized committee of the Congress which has responsibility for the authorization of appropriations for the Commission makes a written request for documents in the possession or subject to the control of the Commission, to submit such documents to the Committee. Requires the Commission to notify such committee if the documents cannot be made available during such period. Stipulates that, in the event the documents are not in the possession of the Commission, the Commission shall notify such committee as to why it does not have documents and inform the Committee of where the documents might be located. Authorizes the Commission to commence, defend, or intervene in civil action within its jurisdiction in its own name if prior to such action the Commission has notified the Attorney General of such action and the Attorney General fails to commence, defend, or intervene in such action within 45 days after such notification. Prohibits any Commissioner from engaging in any other business, vocation, or employment while serving as a Commissioner. Prohibits any Commissioner, or Commission employee at the GS-16 level or higher from (1) acting as agent or attorney before the Commission or attempting to influence the action of the Commission on behalf of anyone other than the United States for a period of two years after the termination of such Commissioner's or employee's service, or (2) making any appearance or attempting to influence the action of the Commission on any particular pending matter for a period of one year after the termination of such Commissioner's or employee's service. States that the appointment of the Chairman of the Commission by the President requires the confirmation of the Senate. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the functions and duties of the Commission."
