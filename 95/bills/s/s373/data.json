    "text": "Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act to permit the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations, subject to certain regulations, except if such taking would reduce a species or population stock below sustainable levels, or with respect to any species or population stock presently below such level. Allows the imposition of fees for permits issued with respect to such incidental taking to recover the cost of placing inspectors upon such commercial fishing vessels. Empowers Federal agents, upon a determination by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce (within their respective jurisdictions) that a reasonable probability exists that a commercial fishing vessel will engage in such taking, to board and accompany such vessel on such trip to observe its fishing operation, and monitor compliance with regulations issued under the Act."
