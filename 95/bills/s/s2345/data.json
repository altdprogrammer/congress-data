It was assigned a new bill number by mistake, S. 2345. Humphrey's office put in a disclaimer on Dec. 7, saying that the revised bill is a revision of S. 50, not a new bill. The Senate vitiated the introduction of S. 2345. The revision was printed in the Congressional Record on Dec. 6, 1977. Pages S19306-S19315)"
