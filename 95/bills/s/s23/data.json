    "text": "Hawaii and United States Pacific Islands Surface Commerce Act - Declares that no strike or lockout in the longshore or maritime industries on the west coast of the United States which imperils the health or well being of the people in any United States Pacific island shall be permitted to interrupt normal shipping from any port on the west coast to any United States Pacific island, or from any such island to the west coast for a period of 120 days. Authorizes the Governors of Hawaii, Guam, or American Samoa, or the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to petition any United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties to any such disruption to enjoin that part of any strike or lockout which disrupts normal shipping between the west coast and any United States Pacific island and threatens the health or well being of such islands. Stipulates that employees who perform services during the term of the injunction shall perform such work pursuant to terms of employment of the existing agreement between employer and employee. Requires that such employees later be fully compensated for the difference between the hourly wage actually paid and the wage which would have been paid under the agreement which resolves the labor dispute."
