States that the amount of such grants shall be based on a rate of 50 cents for each child enrolled in such facilities. Authorizes appropriations of such amounts as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act. Requires State educational agencies to keep accounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to determine whether the provisions of this Act have been complied with. Establishes, within the National Agricultural Library of the United States Department of Agriculture, a Food and Nutrition Information and Education Resources Center to assemble and collect food and nutrition education materials and to disseminate such information to State educational agencies and other interested persons. States that a maximum of $1,500,000 from the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used for the establishment and maintenance of such center."
