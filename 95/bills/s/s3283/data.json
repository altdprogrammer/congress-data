Enumerates the contents of such plans, including descriptions and projections of energy supply and demand in the State, and management and emergency plans. Sets forth mandatory progarms and measures required of States receiving financial assistance, including: (1) energy conservation standards for new buildings; and (2) an energy extension service to disseminate information, provide energy evaluations, and utilize State outreach delivery programs. Describes restrictions on the use of funds provided under this Act. Provides for the allocation of funds by the Secretary among States.
