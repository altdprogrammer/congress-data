    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 12605 passed in lieu) Public Telecommunications Financing Act - =Title I: Construction and Planning of Facilities= - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to establish new procedures for the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities. Sets forth new requirements for the application to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for construction grants. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, upon approving an application with respect to any project for the construction of public telecommunications facilities, to make a grant of up to 75 percent of the cost of such project. Authorizes the Secretary to provide such funds as the Secretary deems necessary for the planning of such projects. Provides for the repayment of such grants if the recipient station ceases to be used for public radio or television purposes. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, public telecommunication entities, and others, to establish criteria for making construction and planning grants. Requires the Secretary to develop a long-range plan to: (1) extend delivery of noncommercial educational and cultural radio and television programs to as many citizens of the United States as possible; (2) increase such noncommercial programs and facilities available to and owned by minorities and women; and (3) strengthen the capability of existing public television and radio stations to provide such noncommercial educational and cultural services to the public. =Title II: Telecommunications Demonstrations= - Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 annually through fiscal year 1981 to be available to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for disbursement as grants for demonstration projects in the improvement of public telecommunications services. =Title III: Corporation for Public Broadcasting= - Authorizes appropriations to the Public Broadcasting Fund for fiscal years 1978 through 1983. Requires the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to develop a system to be used by all public broadcast licensees receiving funds under this Act to account for all funds received and expended for public broadcasting purposes. Requires the Comptroller General to adopt, in consultation with the Corporation and others as appropriate, uniform accounting principles to be used by all public telecommunications entities receiving funds from the Corporation. Requires equal opportunity in employment to be afforded to all qualified persons by all public telecommunications entities receiving funds under this Act. Requires the Secretary to provide for close coordination with the Commission in the administration of the Secretary's responsibilities in enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Act. =Title IV: General Provisions= - Defines terms used in this Act and amends existing definitions to conform to the amendments made by this Act to the Communications Act of 1934. Requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to make an annual report to Congress on the activities of the Administration with respect to: (1) domestic communications; (2) international communications; (3) Government communications; and (4) spectrum plans and policies."
