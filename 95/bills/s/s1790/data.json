Directs the Commission to conduct preliminary hearings prior to issuance of temporary orders on the lawfulness of such proposed schedules. Stipulates that increased rates made immediately effective which are later found to be unjustified shall be refunded to customers. Prohibits public utilities from filing proposed schedules for rate increases while similar proposals are pending before the Commission."
