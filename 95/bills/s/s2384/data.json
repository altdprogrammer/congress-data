    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 10173 passed in lieu) Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act - =Title I: Improved Pension for Veterans and Survivors= - Establishes rates for improved pensions which may be elected in lieu of regular pensions by: (1) veterans of a period of war who are permanently and totally disabled from a non-service-connected dsiability; and (2) surviving spouses or children of veterans of a period of war of deceased veterans entitled to compensation or retirement pay for a service-connected disability. Specifies exclusions from the determination of annual income of such veterans and survivors. Provides that any veteran, surviving spouse, or child receiving a pension under this Title or the Veterans' Pension Act of 1959 may elect at any time to receive such improved pension instead of such other pension. Makes such election irrevocable. Requires persons applying for an improved pension to report the income and estate of each spouse and child on account of whom such added pension is applied for or received. =Title II: Improved Dependency and Indemnity Compensation for Surviving Parents= - Establishes an improved program for parents of veterans receiving dependency and indemnity compensation. Limits eligibility for such improved pension to parents residence within the 50 States or District of Columbia. Allows parents who reside outside of the 50 States or District of Columbia and who become eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation, after the effective date of the improved program, to apply for and receive benefits available under existing law. Provides for certain special situations under the improved program for surviving parents, including, but not limited to, where a parent is eligible for improved compensation and is also a veteran entitled to compensation for a service-connected disability, the Administrator shall pay only the greater benefit. Sets forth exclusions in determining annual income of surviving parents applying for or receiving benefits under such improved program. =Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions and Conforming Amendments= - Requires annual adjustments of security pension rates in conjunction with cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to carry out a comprehensive study of the income characteristics of veterans of a period of war and their survivors who are residing outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Amends the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 to delete the provisions which require States or local governmental units to match the maximum or lesser amount of the accelerated payments for tuition made by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to eligible veterans authorized by such Act. Provides that appropriations necessary to carry out the tuition accelerated payment provisions shall not be made prior to the 96th Congress. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit a report to the Congress, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, concerning the coordination among various programs providing benefits to veterans, including, but not limited to, a description of how the VA and the Social Security Administration currently coordinate the delivery of Veterans' benefits, Social Security retirement and disability benefits, and Supplemental Security Income benefits to elderly and disabled persons. =Title IV: Naming of Certain Veterans' Administration Hospitals= - Provides that the Veterans' Administration Hospitals in Tampa, Florida, and Bedford, Massachusettes, shall be named the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital and the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans' Hospital, respectively. =Title V: Effective Date= - Sets the effective date of this Act as October 1, 1978."
