    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 9214 passed in lieu) Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to make resources available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in an amount not greater than $1,450 million Special Drawing Rights for United States participation in the Supplementary Financing Facility. Requires the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to cover any loss or receive any gain in the United States monetary assets arising from such participation in the facility and fluctuation in the dollar value. Limits the authority of the Secretary to enter into agreements making resources available for United States participation in the Facility to such amounts appropriated in advance. Authorizes appropriations not to exceed an equivalent of $1,450,000 Special Drawing Rights, effective October 1, 1978, to the Secretary for such participation. Stipulates that compensation to the United States executive director to the Fund shall be at a rate not in excess of that provided for level IV of the Executive Schedule, and compensation to the United States alternative executive director to the Fund shall be at a rate not in excess of that provided for level V of the Executive Schedule. States that the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States executive director to the Fund to present to the Fund's Executive Board a comprehensive set of salary reform proposals to assure that salaries of Fund employees are comparable to salaries in national government service or private industry. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States Government should disassociate itself from any foreign government which engages in the international crime of genocide. Prohibits any corporation, institution, group, or individual from importing into the United States or its territories and possessions any article grown, produced, or manufactured in Uganda. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1969 to prohibit the exportation to Uganda of any article, supply, and technical data and information (other than grains or food products) by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Directs the President to: (1) encourage international support of such restrictions; (2) instruct the Executive Director of the United States to IMF to oppose any extension of financial or technical assistance by the Facility or any other agent of IMF to Cambodia or the Republic of Uganda. Terminates such restrictions upon Presidential certification to the Congress that the Government of Uganda or Cambodia is no longer committing violations of human rights and is in compliance with internationally recognized human rights. Requires the Secretary to instruct the Executive Director of the United States to the IMF to oppose the extension of financial or technical assistance by the Facility or agency thereof to any country which permits entry into such country or encourages, supports, or harbors any person who has committed an act of international terrorism or fails to prevent any such person from committing such an act outside its territory. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to report annually to the Congress on the observance of internationally recognized human rights in each country which draws on Funds made available under the Facility of the IMF. States that beginning with fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays of the Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts."
