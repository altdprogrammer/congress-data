    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Federal Physicians Comparability Allowance Act - Provides that the head of a Federal Agency, in order to recruit and retain Government physicians, may enter into a service agreement with a physician for a specified period of service in return for a bonus allowance. Stipulates that such allowance shall not exceed: (1) $7,000 per annum, if the physician has served as a Government physician for 24 months or less; or (2) $10,000 per annum, if the physician has served for more than two years. States that such recruitment and retainment shall be subject to such regulations as the President or his designee may prescribe. States that such allowances shall not be paid to any physician who: (1) is employed on less than a half-time or intermittent basis; (2) occupies an internship or residency training position; (3) is a re-employed annuitant; or (4) is fulfilling a scholarship obligation. Provides that only those physicians who are in categories of positions which have significant recruitment and retention problems shall be eligible for an allowance. Stipulates that unless the physician requests an agreement for a longer period of time, all agreements shall be for a period of one year. States that no agreement shall be entered into later than September 30, 1979, nor shall any agreement extend beyond September 30, 1981. Requires that, in the event that a physician fails to complete at least one year of service pursuant to such agreement, a refund be made in the total amount received unless otherwise provided or unless the agency head determines that circumstances beyond the control of the physician necessitated such a failure. Provides that such agreements shall specify the terms under which an agency head and a physician may terminate the agreement and the amounts required to be refunded. Defines \"Government physician\" to mean any individual employed as a physician who is paid under the General Schedule, the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, the Foreign Service Act of 1946, the Central Intelligence Act of 1949, or the Canal Zone Code. Describes the provisions under which such allowances shall not be considered basic pay. Requires allowances be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the physician's basic pay. Stipulates that the criteria, regulations, or conditions which may be prescribed by the President or designee shall not be applicable to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). States that the TVA shall bear sole responsibility for administering the provisions of this Act with respect to physicians employed by the TVA. States that no agreement may be entered into before the 60th day after enactment of this Act and the pay period for which an allowance may be paid shall not be before the 60th day or October 1, 1978."
