Sets forth limitations on the use of such funds. Amends the Hours of Service Act to define the term \"designated terminal\" as the home terminal or the away from home terminal of a railroad employee. Limits to ten hours the maximum amount of time which a railroad employee may continuously work without a ten hour off duty period. Prohibits the operation of any freight train exceeding 4,300 feet, exclusive of caboose. Prohibits discrimination against railroad employees who complain of violations of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 or who refuse to operate defective equipment which the employee reasonably believes to be in violation of such Act or regulations promulgated thereunder or who refuses to work in an area where the employee believes there is present an imminent danger to health or safety. Establishes within the Federal Railroad Administration an Office of Occupational Safety and Health to administer the occupational health and safety functions of the Administration. Authorizes appropriations for the establishment of such Office."
