    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 11504 passed in lieu) Agricultural Credit Assistance Act - =Title I: Amendments to the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act= - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make real estate loans to private corporations and partnerships controlled by family farmers and ranchers who are engaged primarily and directly in farming and ranching. Stipulates that both the entity and principle stockholders or partners must be unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance their actual needs at reasonable rates and terms. Increases loan limits for farm real estate loans including farm ownership, individual soil and water, and individual recreation loans to $200,000 on insured loans and to $300,000 on guaranteed loans. Authorizes the Secretary to establish total real estate indebtedness limitations each year for such loans. Authorizes the Secretary to make insured or guaranteed loans for the construction, acquisition, and operation of electric power facilities, to rurally located associations, nonprofit corporations, Indian tribes, and public and quasi-public agencies that, as of October 1, 1976, were receiving bulk power from a Federal power administration of the Department of the Interior. Limits such loans to $1,000,000. Includes in gross income, for the purpose of the Internal Revenue Code, interest or other income from obligations evidencing such loans. Designates the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration as the administrant of the loan program. Terminates the authority of the Secretary to make such loans on September 30, 2006. Authorizes appropriations to cover the expenses of administrating this loan program. Authorizes the use of the Rural Development Insurance Fund for these loans. Increases the amount available annually for water and waste disposal grants from $300,000,000 to $1,000,000,000.

Deletes the provision which establishes the Secretary as \"escrow agent\" for the receipt of prepayments of taxes and insurance on real estate loans. Requires borrowers to pay such fees and charges and to prepay such taxes and insurance to the Secretary, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. Repeals the limitation of $500,000,000 on outstanding loans under the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund. Provides that the Rural Development Insurance Fund may be used to pay the Secretary's cost of administration for the rural development loan program. Authorizes the Secretary to purchase the guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed pursuant to this Act. Allows the use of the Rural Development Insurance Fund and the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund for such purchases. Requires the Secretary to determine that an adequate secondary market is not available in the private sector before such authority may be exercised. Exempts small businesses from the restrictions on rural industrial assistance and other loans (if the loan does not exceed $1,000,000 or the employment will not be increased by more than 50 employees). Authorizes farm operating loans to private corporations and partnerships controlled by family farmers and ranchers and engaged primarily and directly in farming or ranching, the principal stockholders or partners of which individually meet eligibility criteria. Changes the limitation on farm operating loans to $100,000 for loans made or insured by the Secretary, and to $200,000 for loans guaranteed by the Secretary. Stipulates that directed or insured farm operating loans shall bear interest at a rate not more than the cost of money to the Government as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, plus up to a one percent charge as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires amounts attributable to the one percent charge to be deposited in either the Rural Development Insurance Fund or the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to consolidate or reschedule outstanding loans for payment over a period not to exceed seven years from the date of such consolidation or rescheduling. Allows new loans to be included in a consolidation. States that guaranteed farm operating loans, including such loans that may be consolidated, shall bear interest at rates agreed upon by the borrower and the lender. Authorizes the Secretary to make and insure loans to applicants whose farming, ranching, or aquaculture operations have been substantially affected by a natural disaster or by a major disaster or emergency designated by the President pursuant to the provisions of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. Establishes a two-tiered interest rate system for emergency loans, or portions of such loans, up to the amount of the actual loss caused by a disaster. Sets the interest rate for those borrowers who cannot obtain credit elsewhere not in excess of three percent. Makes the interest rate for those borrowers who can obtain credit elsewhere not in excess of the average annual interest rate on all interest-bearing obligations of the Government farming part of the public debt as computed the fiscal year preceding the disaster, plus up to one percent per year. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to conduct loan and grant operation and approve transfers and assumptions in connection with properties or facilities securing any loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary, that are located in areas that have ceased to be rural on the same basis as though the areas still were rural.

Requires that appropriations Acts setting budgets levels for programs authorized by this Act state one amount for insured loans and a second, separate amount for guaranteed loans. Authorizes other Federal departments and agencies to participate with the Farmers Home Administration in its programs of financial and technical assistance. Extends the applicability of the Act to the Commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States, including the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands. Authorizes the Secretary to defer the payment of principle and interest on a loan in a disaster area, for not to exceed three years from the date of such deferral. Stipulates that the interest which accrues during the deferral period on any loan deferred shall bear no interest during or after such period. States that if such loan is foreclosed the amount of principal and interest would be used as a basis for the purchase price, and from the date of foreclosure interest shall be charged and shall become a part of the principal. =Title II: Emergency Agricultural Credit Adjustment Act= - Emergency Agricultural Credit Adjustment Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to insure or guarantee loans to bona fide farmers and ranchers, and domestic corporations and partnerships, directly and primarily engaged in agricultural production. Stipulates that such loan applicants must: (1) have adequate experience and resources; (2) need such credit to maintain a viable operation; and (3) be unable to obtain sufficient credit at reasonable rates and terms from normal credit sources. Authorizes insured and guaranteed loans for refinancing outstanding indebtedness, reorganization of the farming and ranching-operation, acquisition of land in order to maintain a normal level of operation, loan closing costs, and operating expenses or other essential farm and home needs. Provides that the Secretary may guarantee up to 90 percent of the principal and interest on any loan made by a legally organized lending agency. Establishes interest rates for: (1) guaranteed loans as agreed to by the lender and borrower; and (2) insured loans as determined by the Secretary, considering the cost of money to the Government, not to exceed one percent annually. Makes the repayment period the same as for loans for similar purposes under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, except the repayment time for operating loans may be extended to 20 years. Limits loans to $500,000 per borrower. Provides that the guaranteed lender must certify an unwillingness to provide credit or continue with the loan applicant in the absence of a guarantee and that the applicant is engaged in agricultural production.
