Provides for an annual cost-of-living increase in such amount based on changes in the cost-of-living and State population. Requires that such increases be passed on the recipients of aid under the program. Establishes a program of supplemental grants to States with high unemployment in accordance with a formula set forth in this Act. Directs that each State plan for the operation of the State AFDC program provide for the reimbursement of the political subdivisions of the State for the amount contributed to the program by the subdivision."
