    "text": "Veterans' Programs Extension Act - Title I: Extension of Certain Programs in the Republic of the Philippines - Extends the authority of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to operate in the Philippines to September 30, 1981, and extends the authority of the Administrator to enter into contracts to provide certain medical services in the Philippines to Commonwealth Army veterans and New Philippine Scouts to fiscal year 1983. Title II: Benefits Payable to Persons Residing Outside the United States - Imposes certain eligibility requirements upon a person adopted by a veteran under non-American law and residing outside the United States during the lifetime of such veteran in order to be considered a legally adopted child for certain veterans' benefits. Directs the Administrator to carry out a study of veterans' benefits to persons living outside the United States, including an evaluation of the desirability of maintaining the Veterans' Administration Regional Office in the Republic of the Philippines. Title III: Health Care Amendments - Extends to December 31, 1980, the authority of the Administrator to provide hospital care through private facilities in certain areas outside the continental United States. Makes such authority permanent for Alaska and Hawaii. Expands such authority to include medical services which will obviate the need for hospital admission. Authorizes the Administrator to furnish hospital, nursing home, and medical services in the United States to Commonwealth Army veterans or New Philippine Scouts for the treatment of service-connected disabilities. Requires the Administrator to furnish a report to the Congress and the President by October 1, 1979, concerning Veterans' Administration hospital and medical care in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Amends the Veterans' Administration Physician and Dentist Pay Comparability Act of 1975 to extend special salary payments to doctors and dentists working for the Veterans' Administration to fiscal year 1979. Authorizes supplemental grants for fiscal year 1979 to assist in the establishment of new State medical schools operated in conjunction with Veterans' Administration facilities. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into contracts with certain organizations to provide reimbursable emergency medical services at such organizations' national conventions. Title IV: Veterans' Readjustment Appointments and Pension Reform Implementation - Extends the authority to make veterans readjustment appointments of Vietnam era veterans to the Federal Government through September 30, 1981. Raises the maximum level for such appointments from GS-5 to GS-7. Provides that any disabled Vietnam era veteran shall be eligible for such appointments without regard to the existing requirement of 14 years of education."
