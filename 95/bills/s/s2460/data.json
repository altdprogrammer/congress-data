    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on on Indian Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1200) Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to allow any Indian tribe or tribal organization which is entitled under such Act to enter into contracts with, or receive grants from, the Secretaries of Health, Education, and Welfare or the Interior, to elect to receive a single consolidated grant in each fiscal year in lieu of or in addition to such contracts. Directs the Secretaries to waive grant regulations which are inconsistent with or inappropriate for the purposes of the Act. Requires a tribe or tribal organization which chooses such consolidated grant to submit to the Secretaries a comprehensive plan, which may include all programs, projects, functions, activities, or services which the Interior Department or the Indian Health Service is authorized to perform for Indians. Requires the Secretaries to provide technical assistance to design and implement such plans. Requires the Secretaries to apply as mandatory all provisions of the Joint Funding Simplification Act to a tribal comprehensive plan which incorporates an application for services, programs, or agencies pursuant to such Act. Provides an administrative remedy to tribes where agencies fail to administer such Act in accordance with the intent of Congress."
