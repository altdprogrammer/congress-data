Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1983: (1) to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities for projects to plan and develop community health centers to serve medically underserved populations; and (2) to make grants for the costs of operation of public and nonprofit private community health centers which serve medically underserved populations.
