    "text": "Fishery Conservation Amendments - Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to declare the need for a national program to prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, promote the development of the domestic fishing industry and to utilize the full potential of the Nation's fishery resources. Requires programs for fishery conservation and management to take into account the economic impact such plans will have on the fishing industry in that region. Declares the fishery conservation programs shall: (1) utilize all scientific information available; (2) develop the domestic fishing industry; (3) minimize adverse impacts on commercial fishermen; (4) provide the greatest overall benefit to the Nation; and (5) encourage the maximum sustainable yield from the fishing industry. Provides for the total closing of a species to fishing upon the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the appropriate regional council that there is an imminent threat to that species. Declares that the Secretary of State shall coordinate a fishery research program with any relevant State, local, academic, or industry sponsored program."
