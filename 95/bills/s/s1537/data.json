    "text": "Interim Regulatory Reform Act - Civil Aeronautics Board - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board to submit to the Congress a proposal setting forth a recodification of all the rules which the Board has issued and which are presently in effect or proposed. Requires the Board to submit with each recodification proposal economic, paperwork, and judicial impact analyses of the probable consequences of each rule proposed to be recodified. Requires that each recodification proposal be published in the Federal Register. Requires the Board to either grant or deny petitions from persons for the commencement of proceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any order, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Board within 120 days after the receipt of such petition. Stipulates that if such a petition is denied or no action is taken on such petition within the 120 day period the Board shall publish in the Federal Register its reasons for such denial or inaction. States that if the Board fails to act or denies a petition the petitioner may commence a civil action in an appropriate United States Court of Appeals for an order directing the Board to institute proceedings regarding such petition. Sets forth standards for the Court to follow regarding such civil actions. Requires the Board, when submitting any budget estimates, requests, or information or any legislative recommendations testimony or comments on legislation to the President or the Office of Management and Budget, to transmit a copy to the Congress. Directs the Board, whenever a duly authorized committee of the Congress which has responsibility for the authorization of appropriations for the Board makes a written request for documents in the possession or subject to the control of the Board, to submit such documents to the Committee. Requires the Board to notify such committee if the documents cannot be made available during such period. Stipulates that in the event the documents are not in the possession of the Board, the Board shall notify such committee as to why it does not have such documents and inform the Committee of where the documents might be located. Authorizes the Board to commence, defend, or intervene in civil actions within its jurisdiction in its own name if prior to such action the Board has notified the Attorney General fails to commence, defend, or intervene in such action within 45 days after such notification. Prohibits any Board member from engaging in any other business, vocation, or employment while serving as a Board member. Prohibits members or employees of the Board at a GS-15 level or above from representing any person in a professional capacity in matters before the Board for a period of two years after the termination of service with the Commission. States that the appointment of the Chairman of the Board by the President requires the confirmation of the Senate."
