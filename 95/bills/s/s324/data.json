Declares that such funds shall be used for making payments to States which have submitted, and had approved by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, State plans for establishment and operation of mobile health care facilities. Enumerates criteria which a State plan must meet prior to approval, including: (1) the existence and operation of a mobile health care team in each of the eligible counties within the State; (2) the establishment or designation of a single State agency to supervise the administration of the plan; and (3) the authorization of the State agency to carry out the plan in conformity with this Act. Requires the periodic review of the eligibility of all counties in each State. Provides that if the State agency supervising the administration of the State plan finds that: (1) the plan has been so changed that it no longer complies with the provisions of this Act; (2) in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with this Act; or (3) an eligible county within the State is not included within the State plan; further payments will not be made to the State until the Secretary is satisfied that there will no longer be any such failure to comply. Amends Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide payment for pediatric nurses services. Defines the terms used in this Act. Provides, under the Social Security Act, for: (1) the training of pediatric nurse practitioners; (2) the payment for services rendered by such pediatric nurse practitioner; (3) expanded services for crippled children; and (4) maternal and child health services for low-income families."
