Directs the Commission to make such interim reports as it deems necessary and to submit a final report of its findings and recommendations to the President and Congress within 30 months after the full Commission is appointed. Abolishes the Commission 90 days after submission of the final report. Authorizes to be appropriated without fiscal year limitation the sum of $10,000,000 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
