Stipulates that such repeal is not an endorsement for any development nor a confirmation of title in lands claimed by any religious or charitable corporation or association. Amends the Act providing the Territory of American Samoa with a non-voting Delegate to the United States House of Representatives to permit any person owing allegiance to the United States, as opposed to citizens only, to be eligible to be a Delegate."
