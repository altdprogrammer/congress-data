Allows the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) to purchase and sell any qualified mortgage which has an outstanding principal balance not in excess of 90 percent of the value of the property securing the mortgage. Removes the interest limitation on such mortgages. Prevents the purchasing of mortgages where the mortgagor's income exceeds a specified level. Place a ceiling on the amount of GNMA purchases and commitments."
