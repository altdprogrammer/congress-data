Directs local governments and authorizes States desiring to participate in programs under this title to establish commissions of specified composition, which bodies shall, among other functions, distribute funds and review applications received under such program. Sets forth formula for allocating program funds among and within the States. Authorizes any State, political subdivision thereof, private nonprofit institution, or profit-making concern desiring to carry out a project under this title to transmit an application to the appropriate commission or State. Specifies information to be included in such an application, including: (1) a description of the type of work to be carried out, the type of employment positions to be filled, and the period during which youths would be employed; (2) a description of the opportunities for skill development and job training which will be made available to youths; and (3) a description of the manner in which the local share of the costs will be provided. Requires applicants to provide assurances regarding hiring preferences, administrative costs, and wages. Enumerates criteria for the approval of applications, including findings that a project will: (1) result in the production of goods and services which are valuable to the community and to the nation; (2) provide appropriate counseling and placement services; (3) provide an inventory of job tasks which can be performed by handicapped individuals; (4) provide effective means through which youths participating in the project may acquire basic education and training; and (5) not impair any existing contract, result in the substitution of Federal funds for the performance of work which would be performed in the absence of the availability of such funds, or result in the substitution of jobs receiving assistance under the title for jobs receiving assistance under any other Federal program. Requires States and commissions, in approving projects under this title, to assure that not less than 75 percent of the youths participating in such projects are members of low-income families and meet specified unemployment standards. Restricts the use of Federal funds for any project to not more than 80 percent of its cost. Title II: General Provisions - Directs the Office of Youth Initiatives to: (1) monitor programs and projects carried out under title I and to submit a report to Congress and the President with respect to the effectiveness of such operations; and (2) carry out research and development activities relative to youth employment programs."
