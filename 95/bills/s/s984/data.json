Directs the Secretary to review: (1) public domain lands; (2) lands in proximity to urban areas which are suitable for the preservation of natural fish and wildlife habitat and for wildlife-oriented recreational activities; and (3) coastal and marine waters to determine the desirability of including such lands or waters within the National Wildlife System.
