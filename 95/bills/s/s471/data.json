States that the surviving spouse of an Indian leaving an interest in trust or restricted land is entitled to a life estate in one-half of such interest. Specifies that a surviving spouse of an Indian leaving a will must elect whether to take under the will or under this Act, unless the will evidences a clear intention that the spouse is to be entitled to both."
