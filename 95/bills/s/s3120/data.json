Entitles the Commission and the Comptroller General, until the expiration of three years after final payment, to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, or records of the contractor or subcontractors engaged in transactions relating to such contracts or subcontracts. Provides that payment made by the Commission to the government of the District of Columbia for specified purposes under such contracts shall be available for matching purposes under any federally funded grant program. Removes the requirement that contracts negotiated for such purposes must be fixed price contracts. Requires the Mayor of the District of Columbia to select a qualified person to conduct such audits for each fiscal year commencing October 1, 1982."
