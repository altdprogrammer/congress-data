    "text": "Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to reduce the total number of visas available to natives of any foreign state in each fiscal year by the number of aliens paroled into the United States for temporary entry during such fiscal year. Prohibits the Attorney General without the prior consent of Congress from paroling into the United States in any fiscal year a total number of aliens from any foreign state in excess of the number of visas available to each such foreign state under such Act. Provides for the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles, or aircraft used to illegally transport aliens into the United States. Prohibits the employment or referral for employment in the United States of any alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. Establishes civil penalties for any employer, agent, or referrer who violates such employment provision. Directs the Secretary of Labor to compile data and publish a quarterly report concerning the employment of illegal aliens. Stipulates that illegal aliens shall be ineligible for assistance under the Food Stamp Act and certain programs under the Social Security Act."
