Provides that the employers in any State in which the laws do not meet the minimum standards shall be required to pay to any employee the difference between the State payments and the payments the Federal standards would require. Authorizes grants to States to assist them in achieving compliance with the minimum standards set forth in this Act. Vests administrative responsibility for these provisions in the Department of Labor. Establishes a National Workers' Compensation Advisory Commission to monitor the progress of the States in meeting the standards established by this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish, by rule making proceedings, standards for determining whether diseases arise out of the course of employment and cause death or disability. Requires any such standard to be a minimum standard for State workers' compensation laws for that disease."
