    "text": "Privacy Protection Act - Prohibits either a Federal or State court from issuing a search warrant for evidence of a crime which authorizes the search of the premises of a person as to whom there is not reasonable cause to believe is implicated in the crime under investigation except upon a showing of reasonable cause to believe that the evidence will be destroyed, hidden, or removed. Prohibits the admission into evidence of matter obtained in a search or seizure violating this Act. Provides that no seizure under color of law but without a warrant of evidence on the premises of a person described above shall be lawful and makes such evidence inadmissible except upon a showing that application for a warrant was impracticable. Grants persons aggrieved by searches in violation of this Act a civil action in a United States district court. Stipulates that nothing in this Act shall be construed as preempting any State from enacting legislation creating a testimonial or other evidentiary privilege for journalists broader than the protections accorded by this Act."
