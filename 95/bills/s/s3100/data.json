Substitutes Supreme Court review by writ of certiorari for certain of these actions. Makes the provisions of this Act effective 90 days after enactment. Provides that the manner of reviewing cases in which a judgment or decree was entered before the effective date or which were pending before the Supreme Court on the effective date shall not be affected."
