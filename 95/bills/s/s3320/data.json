    "text": "Small Business Investment Incentive Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit equal to ten percent of the cost of small business incentive stock (original issue stock issued by a corporation which has equity capital of $25,000,000 or less) acquired by a taxpayer who holds such stock for more than one year. Limits the allowable amount of such credit to $750 for any taxable year. Denies eligibility for such credit to individuals who are claimed as dependents by another taxpayer for purposes of the personal exemption. Disqualifies stock acquired more than 180 days after issuance, stock acquired by an underwriter, certain redemptions or refinancing issues, and investment company stock from treatment as incentive stock. Renders estates or trusts ineligible for the incentive stock tax credit."
