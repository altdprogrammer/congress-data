    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1978-03-22", 
    "text": "Job Opportunities and Family Security Act - Title I: Family Security Program - Amends Title IV, part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of the Social Security Act to include within the definition of \"dependent child\" a child who has been deprived of parental care or support due to the unemployment of a parent. Repeals requirements that the father of a dependent child be unemployed for specified periods of time before his family becomes eligible for aid. Establishes criteria for determining the employment status of a parent based upon average earnings over a specified period of time. Requires an unemployed parent who is eligible for public service employment under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to register for and accept such employment. Permits a State to establish up to three different payment standards for cash assistance under the AFDC program, according to variations in the cost of living within the State. Defines the term \"assistance unit\" and enumerates the individuals to be included in such unit for purposes of this Act. Requires that any income or resources of any member of an assistance unit be included in determining the eligibility of such unit for aid. Sets forth items of income and resources which the State must disregard in determining such eligibility. Increases, to specified levels through fiscal year 1985, the amount of work and child care expenses which are to be disregarded in determining eligibility. Prohibits disregard of the earned income of any member of an assistance unit who refuses or terminates employment without good cause, earns more in any month than the established need of the assistance unit, or fails to give a timely report of his earned income for any month. Reduces, according to a specified formula, AFDC payments in the case of a dependent child who lives in a home in which an individual who is either not legally responsible for the support of such child or is not eligible for assistance payments is also residing. Provides Federal financial and technical support to the States for the installation of automated claims processing and management information systems to aid in the administration of State plans under the AFDC program. Requires members of an assistance unit to apply for any private or public retirement or disability plan, unemployment compensation or similar benefits to which they may be entitled. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay quarterly to each State which has an approved plan for aid and services to needy families with children an amount equal to the Federal public assistance percentage for each State, as determined under this Act, multiplied by the total quarterly amount expended by each State for its AFDC programs. Limits the amount of Federal matching funds payable to the States to 100 percent of the Federal nonfarm poverty line as established by the Office of Management and Budget. Establishes a Federal public assistance percentage for fiscal year 1980, with specified yearly increases through fiscal year 1982. Reduces the Federal public assistance percentage for States that have payment error rates in excess of four percent, and requires such States, subject to a further reduction in the public assistance percentage, to insure that no political subdivision is required to provide any funding under the State plan or to administer any part of such plan. Repeals payment limitations applicable to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam under the programs of AFDC, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income, and certain other titles of the Social Security Act. Directs the States to base eligibility for, and amount of, payments to an assistance unit on a one-month retrospective accounting period or a one-month prospective period. Permits States to require, as a condition of eligibility for AFDC benefits, that assistance units report to the State agency each month any changes in income or circumstances. Establishes minimum benefit amounts which States must pay to eligible assistance units for fiscal years 1981 through 1985. Renders an assistance unit ineligible for aid where the resources of such unit exceed specified levels. Changes all references to the AFDC program throughout the Social Security Act to Family Security Program or Aid for Family Security, as appropriate. Requires AFDC recipients to register for the Work Incentive (WIN) program. Exempts certain employees, college students, and public service workers under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act from registration. Places responsibility for the establishment and operation of the WIN program with the States. Requires the Governor of each State administering a work incentive program to report annually on the operation of such program to the Secretary of Labor. Limits the amount of appropriation that may be authorized for the WIN program. Directs the Secretary of Labor to estimate, prior to each quarter of each fiscal year, the amount required by each State for its WIN program and to pay such amount to each State. Establishes a program of Federal payments for foster care maintenance and adoption assistance under Title IV of the Social Security Act. Declares that a State, to be eligible for payments under this Act, shall have a plan for the administration of such program. Sets forth the requirements for approval of such a plan by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Authorizes the States to make payments for foster care maintenance and adoption assistance and sets forth the requirements children and adoptive parents must meet to receive assistance under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to fund the programs established by this Act and provides for payments to the States each quarter, according to a specified formula. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a State with technical assistance in developing programs established by this Act. Title II: Jobs Program - Authorizes appropriations for public service jobs under Title VI of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 through fiscal year 1983. Directs each CETA prime sponsor to provide from allocated funds a guaranteed public service job for one adult in any AFDC-Unemployed Parent household who has searched unsuccessfully for a regular job for 90 days. Directs such prime sponsor to provide from 50 percent of available remaining public service jobs, jobs to other AFDC recipients, and from the other 50 percent, jobs to individuals who have been unemployed for 26 weeks or more. Establishes a private sector voucher program for jobs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 to encourage employment in the private sector of AFDC recipients, unemployed adults and youths who have searched unsuccessfully for employment for 90 days, and individuals whose public service employment under CETA has terminated and who have searched for employment for at least 30 days. Provides private sector employers who hire individuals eligible for the voucher program with a one dollar per hour subsidy if such individual is paid according to the prevailing rate for the work he performs. Prohibits employers from using voucher-eligible employees to replace regular employees or reduce their hours. Title III: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the earned income credit to equal 15 percent of an individual's earned income which does not exceed the official poverty line as established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Increases from 10 to 20 percent of the excess adjusted gross income or earned income, whichever is greater, the amount by which the earned income credit will be reduced when such income exceeds the official poverty line. Makes the earned income credit permanent. Requires employers to make advance payments of the earned income credit to employees certified as qualifying for the credit during the current year. Treats payment of this advance credit as payment of the employer's FICA and withholding amounts, and treats failure to make advance payments as a failure to deduct and withhold FICA amounts when they would otherwise be due. Provides that any amount refunded to an individual as an earned income credit shall not be treated as income for purposes of State taxation and shall be disregarded in determining eligibility for a federally funded public assistance program. Sets forth criteria for determining the amount of the credit for the employment of certain new employees. Makes such credit permanent. Increases an individual's income tax liability by the amount that adjusted gross income, plus welfare and food stamp benefits which are received during the year, exceed specified \"tabular amounts\" based upon such individual's number of personal exemptions. Prescribes \"tabular amounts\" ranging from $5,470 for individuals with one personal exemption to $14,650 for persons with seven or more exemptions. Limits the credits which can be taken against an individual's income tax liability for excess food stamp and welfare benefits to the credits for excess withholding taxes, certain uses of gasoline, special fuels and lubricating oil, and earned income. Title IV: Supplemental Security Income Payments - Permits States to pay increased cash benefits to supplemental security income recipients in lieu of food stamp coupons. Lowers the age limit for eligibility for supplemental security income benefits from 65 to 64 in 1980, 63 in 1981, and 62 in 1982 and succeeding years. Title V: Food Stamp Provisions - Authorizes demonstration projects for converting food stamp benefits into increased cash payments for recipients of supplemental security income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. Repeals provisions authorizing payment and distribution of food stamp coupons under the AFDC program. Title VI: Assistance to Meet Emergency Needs - Authorizes appropriations to States for the establishment of plans to provide emergency assistance to any needy family or individual whose living expenses are not met by the State's AFDC program. Sets forth requirements for the operation of a State plan for emergency assistance. Repeals current provisions for emergency assistance to needy families with dependent children. Title VII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor) to establish demonstration projects to evaluate the feasibility of establishing consolidated public assistance centers to aid individuals in applying for aid under any Federal or federally assisted program for which such individual may be eligible. Directs the Secretary (in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor) to establish demonstration projects to evaluate the feasibility of (1) consolidating public assistance programs and placing the financial responsibility for such programs on the Federal Government and (2) permitting States to operate public assistance programs without Federal regulation. Requires the Secretary (in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Labor, and the Treasury) to conduct a review of the effects of this Act and to report to Congress. Establishes a National Commission on Public Assistance to conduct a continuing study, investigation, and review of, public assistance programs, and to make recommendations for improvements in such programs."
