    "text": "National Energy Conservation Policy Act -- Title I: Energy Conservation Programs for Existing Residential Buildings -- Directs the Federal Energy Administrator to establish procedures for the submission, approval, and implementation of residential energy conservation plans by State utility regulatory authorities. Prescribes energy conservation measures to be included in such plans. Establishes criteria governing programs to be carried out by public utilities as part of such energy conservation plans. Authorizes exemptions from such requirements where alternative programs will be implemented. Authorizes the Administrator to implement and enforce a Federal plan in the event of inadequate State action. Amends the National Housing Act to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to prescribe an actuarially sound premium rate for loans for energy conserving improvements. Amends the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act and the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act to include loans or credits for energy conservation purposes within the scope of such programs. Authorizes additional appropriations for the weatherization assistance program administered by the Federal Energy Administrator under the Energy Conservation and Production Act. Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to direct the Association to make and insure loans for qualified residential energy conservation measures. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans to individuals and families to assist in the purchase and installation of qualified solar heating or cooling equipment.
