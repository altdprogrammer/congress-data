Requires every credit, insurance, and banking institution to notify its customers of the routine disclosures it expects to make of any information maintained on its customers. Prohibits the disclosure, without the customer's authorization, of information inconsistent with such notification except: (1) to prevent or protest against the possible occurrence of fraud; or (2) where necessary to service the credit, insurance or banking relationship; or (3) in response to an administrative summons or judicial order. Requires such institutions to notify their customers of changes in their disclosure policies. Permits unauthorized disclosures by insurance institutions and insurance support organizations as defined in this Act only to physicians. State insurance regulators, or where required by a mandatory reporting statute or legal order. Allows unauthorized disclosures to coinsurers, reinsurers, or any other party in interest to the insurance transaction, provided: (1) the disclosed information is limited to matters relevant to the insurance transaction; (2) the recipient is prohibited from disclosure as defined in this Act; (3) the consumer is notified of the disclosure; (4) any disclosed medical information was obtained directly from the consumer, his doctor, parent, guardian, or spouse; (5) the information is disclosed to an organization whose sole function is to prevent fraud in claim settlements; and (6) the insurance institution is prohibited from using the information for other than claim purposes. Imposes civil liability for willful or negligent breach of the provisions of this Act."
