Requires a contract between the Service and a public organization, pursuant to this Act, to direct reversion of the right to facilities use and water rights should the public organization fail to carry out its contractual obligations. Restricts contracts for the use of certain lands to wildlife and water fowl habitat conservation or purposes agreed upon by the Service and the public organization."
