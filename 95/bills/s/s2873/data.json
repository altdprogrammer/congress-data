    "text": "Ocean Shipping Act - Amends the Shipping Act, 1916, to include \"controlled carriers\" within the coverage of such Act. Defines \"controlled carrier\" as a common carrier by water which operates or proposes to offer service in the foreign commerce of the United States where the carrier is owned or controlled by a government or governments. Prohibits such carriers from maintaining rates or charges in its tariffs filed with the Federal Maritime Commission which are below a level which is just and reasonable or from establishing unjust or unreasonable classifications, rules, or regulations in such tariffs. Authorizes the Commission to disapprove unreasonable or unjust tariff provisions after notice and hearing. Requires that such rates, classifications, rules and regulations be filed at least 30 days before they are to become effective. Authorizes the Commission to suspend such tariff provisions pending a determination as to their lawfulness. Stipulates that the regulations contained in this Act shall not apply to rates or classifications governing the transportation of cargo by a controlled carrier between the country which owns or controls the carrier and the United States or its territories or possessions. Exempts from the regulations contained in this Act controlled carriers of a state whose vessels are entitled to receive national or most-favored-nation treatment by treaty, controlled carriers of a State which has subscribed to the statement of shipping policy contained in note 1 to annex A of the Code of Liberalization of Current Invisible Operations, or to specified rate agreements or service agreements under the Shipping Act, 1916. Requires the Commission to transmit suspension or disapproval orders to the President concurrently with the publication of such an order. Authorizes the President to request the Commission to stay such an order for a period of 120 days if such stay is required for reasons of national defense or foreign policy. Requires the Commission to immediately grant such a request."
