Entitles a qualified State retirement system, which credits a teacher for out-of-State service to Federal aid of 50 percent of the total cost to the system of such out-of-State credit. Specifies the requirements which a State retirement system must meet in order to qualify for Federal aid under this program. Limits the amount of the Federal aid to a State retirement system to an amount providing not more than ten years of out-of-State service credit. Directs the Commissioner of Education to make a grant to each qualified State retirement system of an amount equal to two percent of such system's Federal aid received under this Act for the costs of administration."
