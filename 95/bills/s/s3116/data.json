Rept. 95-1196) Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Act - =Title I: Formula and Project Grants for Preventive Health Services= - Amends the Public Health Service Act to set forth a new method for determining the total amount of grants received by State health and mental health authorities for comprehensive public health services. Authorizes appropriations for such grants through fiscal year 1981. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to States to assist them in planning for and in meeting the costs of providing preventive health services. States that an application for such a grant shall provide for a detailed plan of a program to reduce, through the prevention of causative conditions, the mortality rates, and, at the option of the applying State, the burden of illness associated with the five leading causes of death in the State. Sets forth specified information to be included in applications for such grants. Requires the Secretary to review annually the activities undertaken by each State pursuant to an approved application. Sets forth a procedure for determining the amount of grants which each State shall receive for starting preventive health services programs. Requires that all information obtained about any individual under any program that is being carried out with respect to such grants shall not be disclosed without such individual's consent, except for specified health service, research or statistical, audit or evaluation, or other purposes required by law. States that this title shall not be construed to require any State or local agency to have a preventive health service program which would require any person, who objects to any treatment provided under such a program, to be treated or to have any child or ward treated under such program. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States, political subdivisions of States, other public entities, or private entities to assist them in meeting the costs of establishing and maintaining: (1) programs for the screening, detection, diagnosis, prevention, referral for treatment, and follow-up on compliance with treatment of hypertension; (2) programs to immunize children against diseases; (3) community and school-based fluoridation programs; and (4) programs to prevent disease borne by rodents. Sets forth specified information to be included in applications for such grants. Requires the Secretary to review annually the activities undertaken by each State pursuant to an approved application. Requires that all information obtained about any individual under any program carried out with respect to such grants shall not be disclosed without such individual's consent, except for specified health service, research or statistical, audit or evaluation, or other purposes required by law. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1981 for lead-based paint poisoning prevention programs. =Title II: Resources for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion= - Directs the Secretary to undertake or support five intensive and comprehensive community based programs to demonstrate and evaluate optimal methods for organizing and delivering comprehensive preventive health services to defined populations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a comprehensive program designed to deter smoking among children and adolescents; and (2) conduct a study or studies of the relative health risks associated with smoking cigarettes of varying levels of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide, and containing any substances commonly added to commercially manufactured cigarettes. Requires the Secretary, acting through the National Center for Health Statistics or its equivalent, to submit to Congress on December 1, 1980, and on December 1 of every third year thereafter, a national disease prevention data profile in order to provide a data base for the effective implementation of this Act and to increase public awareness of the prevalence, incidence, and any trends in the preventable causes of death and disability in the United States. =Title III: Office of Physical Fitness and Sports Medicine= - Directs the Secretary to establish in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an Office of Physical Fitness and Sports Medicine to support projects, conduct research, and disseminate information in the areas of physical fitness and sports medicine. Designates the President's Council on Physical Fitness as an Advisory Body of such Office. Authorizes the Office: (1) to make matching grants to each State for the establishment of State Councils on Physical Fitness, or appropriate similar administrative units; (2) to make grants or enter into contracts with public or private entities to conduct research and establish model projects with regard to improvement of physical fitness; (3) to establish a program of project grants to research the problem of athletic injuries; and (4) to establish a Clearinghouse on Sports Medicine Research to disseminate the results of such research to practitioners in relevant fields of health care and physical fitness. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 to carry out the purposes of this title. Directs the Office and the Office of Education to conduct a joint conference during 1979 on the teaching and support of educational programs in lifetime sports by secondary and postsecondary educational institutions."
