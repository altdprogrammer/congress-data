Prohibits the construction of water resources projects in the Upper Delaware River area for up to three years after the enactment of this Act, where the Secretary determines that such activity would directly and adversely effect property being considered for exclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Requires the Secretary to publish proposed land use control guidelines in the Federal Registry and to assure that ample opportunity is afforded for state, local and private parties to participate in the development of the land use control measures for the Upper Delaware River component."
