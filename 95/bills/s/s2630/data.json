    "text": "WIC Amendments - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to provide the funds necessary to enable all States to operate or expand programs that provide supplemental nutrition and nutrition education to pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, and children (WIC programs). Requires each State to publicize the availability of WIC program benefits, using bilingual material in areas where a substantial number of low-income households speak a language other than English. Authorizes the appropriation of specified amounts for WIC programs through fiscal year 1982. States that 20 percent of the funds appropriated for WIC programs shall be made available for State and local agency operational costs. Requires each State to submit annual plans describing how WIC program funds will be used. Requires States to hold public hearings on such plans. Increases the membership of the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition from 15 to 20 members. Adds representatives from specified groups, among them, Indian WIC programs and migrant WIC programs. Directs the Secretary to require all States receiving funds under this Act to insure continuous availability of program benefits to eligible migrant agricultural workers as they move from State to State. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations to prevent the dual receipt of benefits under the WIC program and the commodity supplemental food program."
