    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Report 95-1796) Authorizes to be appropriated to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) specified sums for fiscal year 1979 for: (1) Nuclear Reactor Regulation; (2) Standards Development; (3) Inspection and Enforcement; (4) Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards; (5) Nuclear Regulatory Research; (6) Program Technical Support; (7) Program Direction and Administration; (8) Contracts for studying domestic safeguards matters; and (9) studies of Alternative Fuel Cycles. Stipulates that no funds may be transferred from any of these listed major programs to another if the total funds so transferred would exceed $500,000 unless after submission of a written request: (1) each authorizing committee of Congress transmits to the Commission assurance that there is no objection to such reallocation or; (2) a period of 30 days (or 90 days in the case of earmarked funds) has passed and no written notice from authorizing committees has been received. Permits: (1) moneys received by the Commission for the cooperative nuclear research programs to be retained and used for salaries and expenses associated with those programs; and (2) transfers of sums from salaries and expenses to be made to other agencies of the Government for the performance of the work for which the appropriation is made. Requires the Directors of Program Offices, if they communicate directly with the Commission, to keep the Executive Director for Operations fully and currently informed of the content of such communications. Requires the Executive Director for Operations to report at semiannual public meetings on the problems, progress, and status of the Commission's equal employment opportunity efforts. Directs the Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a preliminary planning study and develop a design for an epidemiological research study of the health effects of low level ionizing radiation. Stipulates that, within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency shall submit to the Congress a memorandum of understanding delineating their respective responsibilities in the conduct of such planning study. Requires that a final report be submitted to Congress on or before April 1, 1979, concerning the assessment of capabilities and research needs of such agencies. Requires the Commission, EPA, and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit a report to Congress by September 30, 1979, concerning the options and feasibility for Federal epidemiological research. Requires the Commission's Executive Director to report to the Commission and to Congress on the status of the Commission's domestic safeguards programs. Authorizes and directs the Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the existing process for selection and training of members of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards, report to the Congress on the findings of such review by January 1, 1979, and revise such selection and training process as appropriate, based on such findings. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require any person proposing to enter into an arrangement with the Commission for the conduct of research, development, evaluation activities, or for technical and management support services to furnish such information to the Commission as will allow a determination as to the existence or absence of a conflict-of-interest. Directs the NRC to monitor and assist the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation and the Department of Energy fuel cycle studies. Requires the NRC to report to Congress on the progress of domestic and international fuel cycle evaluations. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to prohibit any employee from being fired or discriminated against as a result of the fact that they have testified, given evidence, or brought suit under the Act or the Atomic Energy Act. Permits any such employee within 30 days of a violation to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct an investigation and to issue an order for the employee to be rehired, or otherwise compensated (including costs of litigation, reasonable attorney and expert witness fees). Requires the NRC to report to Congress on January 1, 1979, and annually thereafter on its use of contractors, consultants, and the National Laboratories. Directs the Commission, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, to study and report to Congress concerning radioactive waste storage and disposal activities and the need for Commission regulation of such activities. Requires: (1) notification to the Commission and the affected State of any planned development of a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility; and (2) a report to Congress by the Commission on means for improving the opportunities for State participation in siting, licensing, and developing such facilities."
