    "text": "Interim Regulatory Reform Act - Interstate Commerce Commission - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to direct the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission to submit to the Congress a proposal setting forth a recodification of all the rules which the Commission has issued and which are presently in effect or proposed. Requires the Commission to submit with each recodification proposal economic, paperwork, and judicial impact analyses of the probable consequences of each rule proposed to be recodified. Requires that each recodification proposal be published in the Federal Register. Requires the Commission when submitting any budget estimates, requests or information or any legislative recommendations, testimony or comments on legislation to the President or the Office of Management and Budget to transmit a copy to the Congress. Directs the Commission whenever a duly authorized committee of the Congress which has responsibility for the authorization of appropriations for the Commission makes a written request for documents in the possession or subject to the control of the Commission, to submit such documents to the Committee. Requires the Commission to notify such committee if the documents cannot be made available during such period. Stipulates that, in the event the documents are not in the possession of the Commission, the Commission shall notify such committee as to why it does not such documents and inform the Committee of where the documents might be located. Authorizes the Commission to commence, defend, or intervene in civil actions within its jurisdiction in its own name if prior to such action the Commission has notified the Attorney General of such action and the Attorney General fails to commence, defend, or intervene in such action within 45 days after such notification. Authorizes the Commission to represent itself in its own name in specified civil suits and before the Supreme Court in the absence of a disapproval by the Attorney General. Reduces the membership of the Commission from eleven to seven. Prohibits any Commissioner from engaging in any other business, vocation, profession, or employment while serving as a Commissioner. Prohibits Commissioners or persons employed by the Commission at a GS-15 level or above from representing any person in a professional capacity in matters before the Commission for a period of the years after the termination of such service with the Commission. States that the appointment of the Chairman requires the confirmation of the Senate."
