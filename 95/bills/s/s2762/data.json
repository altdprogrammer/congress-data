    "text": "National Aquaculture Organic Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a National Aquaculture Development Plan. Requires that such plan (1) identify each aquatic species which can be cultured on a commercial basis (priority aquatic species), and (2) contain a program of aquaculture development for such priority aquatic species. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to review each aquatic species not identified as a priority species and the program established for each priority species. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to (1) establish and maintain an aquaculture information center, (2) maintain an inventory of public and private aquaculture being carried out in the United States, (3) arrange for the mutual exchange of information relating to aquaculture with foreign nations, and (4) submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of the provisions of this Act. Establishes the Interagency Committee on Aquaculture comprised of the heads of various Federal agencies to insure that there is a continuing exchange of information relating to the aquacultural programs and projects of the various agencies and to review on a continuing basis the relevant programs and projects of all Federal agencies. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to carry out any function under this Act through grants or contracts. Limits the amount of any grant made available under this Act to one-half of the estimated cost of the project for which the grant was made.

Stipulates that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such guaranteed obligations shall not exceed $500,000,000.

Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program to provide essential property or liability insurance to owners of aquaculture facilities at reasonable rates upon a determination that the issuance of such insurance is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act.
