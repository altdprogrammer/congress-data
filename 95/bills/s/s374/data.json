Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $500,000 for this purpose. Grants the Bank the authority: (1) to make commitments to purchase, and to purchase, service, and sell home mortgages on single family homes, or condominiums or cooperatives, from the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Bank system, and (2) to make commitments to purchase, and to purchase, hold, and refinance mortgages on homes of persons who certify that they have been unemployed for six months and do not have assets that could be used to pay the mortgage on their principal dwelling place. Authorizes the Bank to declare a moratorium on payments of principal, interest, or both for a period of 18 months on terms and conditions to be determined by the Bank so as to alleviate hardship arising from unemployment. Authorizes the Bank to issue and have outstanding obligations having such maturities and bearing such interest as may be determined by the Bank.
