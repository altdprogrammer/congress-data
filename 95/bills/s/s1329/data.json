    "text": "Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments - Amends the Federal Advisory Committee Act to authorize the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to refuse to permit the establishment of specified advisory committees if any such advisory committee, in his opinion, will not serve an essential function, will not represent a balance of differing views, or is not otherwise in the public interest. Declares that such an advisory committee shall not be established if, within 20 days of the filing of such an advisory committee's charter, either the Committee on Government Operations of the House or the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate vetoes such establishment. Directs each agency Advisory Committee Management Officer to insure specified requirements are fulfilled including: (1) the filing of specified advisory committee reports in written form; (2) the maintenance of an advisory committee's proposed budget within ten percent or $300, whichever is less; and (3) maintenance of advisory committee membership to assure a balance of differing views. Authorizes the Director to terminate any advisory committee which does not meet similar requirements. Specifies restrictions on advisory committee membership including: (1) the prohibition of service by a person on any advisory committee dealing with matters in which such person has a personal or financial interest or involvement; (2) the prohibition of service by a person on an advisory committee for more than six years; and (3) the prohibition of service by more than one officer or employee of any corporation on the same advisory committee at any one time. Requires the charter of specified advisory committees to address specified issues, including: (1) financial support required; (2) estimated dollar value of the time and expenses of any Federal employee or agency in assisting in the operation of such advisory committee; and (3) specified costs involved in the operation of such advisory committee. Prohibits the Director or any agency head from approving the funding of any advisory committee over such committee's budget without a determination that such funds are essential to the performance of the advisory committee's mission and the need of such additional funds could not have been reasonably anticipated."
