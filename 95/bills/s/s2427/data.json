Authorizes the Board to appoint law clerks for administrative law judges. Directs the Board to issue regulations to implement provisions governing selection of labor representatives, including rules which protect specified employee and labor organization rights, facilitate the resolution of disputes concerning voter eligibility, and govern elections in cases in which an appeal has not been decided prior to the date of election. Revises criteria for organizations which may represent guards. Sets forth procedures for expedited elections where an employee, group of employees, or representatives thereof file a petition stating that (1) a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit have designated a representative which the certified or recognized with respect to any employee in the bargaining unit, or (2) a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit do not wish to be represented by the certified or recognized representative or to be covered by a collective bargaining agreement entered into by such representative and the employer. Denies, for up three years unless there is no alternative source, public contracts to persons willfully violating final orders regarding unfair labor practices. Stipulates that members of bona fide religious which have historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting labor organizations shall not be required to do so as a condition of employment. Specifies damages available to employees when (1) there is coercion based on union membership during certain periods or (2) there is an unlawful refusal to bargain prior to entry into a first bargaining contract. Provides for expedited consideration of and relief from certain alleged unfair labor practices which resulted in a deprivation of employment. Amends the Labor-Management Relations Act to authorize Federal courts to restrain (1) a concerted refusal in breach of an existing collective bargaining contract to cross a picket line not maintained by a labor organization or (2) a concerted refusal to work in breach of an existing collective bargaining contract that is not sanctioned by the appropriate labor organization. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to defer public disclosure of each Federal Open Domestic Policy Directive of the Federal Open Market Committee until three days after the regular monthly meeting of the Committee following the meeting at which the Directive was written."
