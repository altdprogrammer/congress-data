    "text": "National Agricultural, Range, and Forest Land Policy Act - Title I: Objectives - Declares that it is the policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local governments, to use all practicable methods to retain, protect, and improve agricultural, range, and forest land, to reduce its conversion to non-food-and-fiber producing uses, and to limit the encroachment of industrial activities. Title II: Research Program - Establishes an Agricultural Land Review Commission to study: (1) agricultural, range, and forest land in the United States; (2) the effects of industrial development, climate and other factors on the productivity of such land; (3) the acquisition of such land by persons not engaged in agricultural or forestry activities; (4) the impact of Federal, State and local laws and regulations on such land; and (5) methods of protecting and improving such land, and of reducing the amount of it being converted from agricultural and forestry uses to nonvital uses. Authorizes the Commission to make grants to institutes of higher learning to do research pursuant to its study. Requires the Commission to report its findings, conclusions and recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture and to Congress. Terminates such Commission on September 30, 1982. Title III: Demonstration Programs - Authorizes the Secretary to pay up to 60 percent of the cost and to provide technical assistance to any State pilot project undertaken to demonstrate and test methods of reducing the amount of land being converted from agricultural, range, and forest uses to nonessential uses. Requires all such projects to be completed within five years after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to report his findings, conclusions and recommendations to the President and to Congress. Title IV: Funding - Authorizes for Title II programs the appropriation of $8,000,000. Authorizes for Title III programs the appropriation of $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1978 through 1982."
