Directs the Secretary: (1) to develop and distribute a standard report form to facilitate automated data processing, analysis, and reporting of the information gathered; (2) to analyze such information to determine the trends and the actual and potential effects that the acquisition, transferring, and holding of agricultural lands in the United States by foreign persons have on the agricultural industry, the national economy, and the foreign relations of the United States; and (3) to report his findings and conclusions to the President and to the appropriate committees of Congress. Directs the Secretary to require the Office of Inspector General to conduct periodic studies to determine the reliability of information gathered pursuant to this Act. Establishes a civil penalty for violation of any provision of this Act in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the land interest involved on the date of the penalty assessment."
