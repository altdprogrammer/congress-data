    "text": "Privacy Protection for Rape Victims Act - Amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to prohibit in cases of rape or assault with intent to rape the introduction of reputation or opinion evidence of a person's past sexual behavior. Permits the introduction of evidence of specific instances of a person's past sexual behavior only if such evidence is offered by the accused and is either: (1) on the issue of whether the accused was the source of pregnancy, disease, semen, or injury; or (2) on the issue of whether the alleged victim consented to the sexual behavior with respect to which the crime is alleged and restricted to the victim's past sexual relations with the defendant. Requires an accused who intends to introduce any such evidence to make a written motion to the court accompanied by a written offer of proof. Directs the court to hold a hearing on any such motion in chambers to determine admissibility."
