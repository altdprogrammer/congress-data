    "text": "Federal Sentencing Standards Act - Establishes a Federal Sentencing Commission to develop a schedule of imprisonment or other penalty prescribing a presumptive sentence for each criminal offense and a schedule prescribing variations from any presumptive sentence on account of mitigating or aggravating circumstances and specifying which types of situations shall qualify as such a circumstance. Limits increases in terms of imprisonment due to aggravating circumstances to 50 percent. Prohibits consideration of deterrence in determining aggravating and mitigating factors. Restricts presumptive sentences of imprisonment to serious crimes and presumptive sentences of imprisonment over five years to six enumerated crimes, including murder, aircraft highjacking, and forcible rape. Grants to the Commission authority to prescribe rules for deductions or increases in prison terms on the basis of behavior while confined and for post-release supervision of offenders. Specifies duties of the sentencing court and exclusive grounds for appeal of a sentence."
