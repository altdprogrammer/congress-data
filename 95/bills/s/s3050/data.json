    "date": "1978-06-14", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 95-935) Fishery Conservation Amendments Act - Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act: (1) to delete from the definition of fishing any operations at sea in support of or in preparation for catching or harvesting fish; and (2) to delete processing vessels from the definition of fishing vessels. Defines process or processing as any method of freezing, canning, smoking, salting, drying, or other treatment of fish in preparation for commercial use. Defines a processing vessel as any vessel or craft used to process, store, refrigerate or transport fish or fish products. Amends such Act to declare the sense of Congress that each governing international fishery agreement (GIFA) include a binding commitment, on the part of each foreign nation its processing vessels as well as fishing vessels, and the owner or operator of any such vessel to comply with the terms and conditions of the GIFA and regulations promulgated thereunder. Includes processing vessels in the requirement (1) that the foreign nation and the owners or operators of all fishing vessels of that nation assume responsibility for the reimbursement of United States citizens for any loss of, or damage to, their fishing vessels, fishing gear or catch which is caused by such vessel; and (2) that the foreign nation, when issued permits for its vessels, shall deliver the permit promptly to the vessels. Requires the Secretary of State, in allocating the total allowable level of foreign fishing, to consider any applicable tariff or nontariff condition on the importation of fish or fish products from the United States that are greater than those imposed by the United States. Amends such Act to require that each preliminary management plan require processing vessels, as well as fishing vessels, to obtain a permit from the Secretary of Commerce. Requires the Secretary of State, upon request of and in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, to initiate and conduct negotiations for the purpose of entering into international fishery agreements to allow United States processing vessels, in addition to United States fishing vessels, equitable access to fish within other nations fishery jurisdiction zones. Requires foreign processing vessels in the United States fishery conservation zone to have valid permits on board the vessel. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to approve a foreign processing vessel permit application unless the United States processing capability is, or will be, during the period for which the application is made, adequate for processing the fish harvested from the fishery involved. Applies the civil penalties provisions of the Act to processing vessels (presently fishing vessels)."
