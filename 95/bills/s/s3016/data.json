  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1978-05-01", 
    "text": "Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments - Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to stipulate that, upon the cancellation of stock in a Regional Corporation on December 18, 1991, and issuance of new shares, as is now provided for by such Act, certain restrictions may be imposed on such new shares. Includes among the restrictions which shareholders may impose: (1) the denial of voting rights to non-Native shareholders; and (2) restrictions on alienation of such stock. Authorizes a shareholder who is a member of a profession which limits the ability of such shareholder to practice such profession while owning stock in a Regional Corporation, to transfer such stock in order to practice his or her profession. Stipulates that a Village Corporation shall first convey to the occupants, specified titles to the surface estates in the tracts occupied by such occupants as of December 18, 1971. Authorizes payment to the prevailing party in any action under the Act brought by or against the United States of such a sum as will in the opinion of the court reimburse such party for reasonable costs, including attorney fees. Stipulates that all rents, royalties, profits, and other revenues or proceeds derived from real property interests received pursuant to the Act shall be taxable to the same extent as such revenues or proceeds are taxable when received by a non-Native individual or corporation. Stipulates that any unimproved real property interest acquired in exchange for a real property interest which is exempt from real property taxes shall be deemed to be a property interest conveyed pursuant to this Act and shall be exempt from taxation as if conveyed pursuant to this Act. Stipulates that upon the termination of withdrawn or reserved status, or upon the declaration of surplus status, any withdrawals, reservations, or other public lands excepted from Native selection by the Act, which are located within the village withdrawal area, or within the area of a former withdrawal or reserve for the benefit of the Native Village or its inhabitants shall be made available to the Village Corporation on the basis of an acre-for-acre exchange for other selections or selection rights of the Corporation. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to pay, by grant, $100,000 to specified incorporated Native groups established under the Act and certified by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as an eligible Native Group. Directs that all Alaska Native allotment applications pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, be approved. States that no corporation created pursuant to the Act shall be considered a personal holding company within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. Authorizes necessary appropriations for the escrow account, established pursuant to this Act, into which funds are deposited which are derived from contracts pertaining to lands withdrawn for Native selection. Authorizes the Village of Chenega corporation and the Village of English Bay corporation to file selections upon specified land. Authorizes the regional corporation for the Chugach Region to select lands from within the Chugach National Forest. Validates selections of public lands made pursuant to the Act by Village Corporations in townships which the Village Corporations contended, at the time of such selection, were withdrawn by reason of the Act but which the Secretary of the Interior contended were not withdrawn. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to review, at five-year intervals, the conditions under which lands in the National Wildlife Refuge System were conveyed to a Village Corporation. Stipulates that if the Secretary finds that such lands remain essential to the needs of the wildlife refuge system the Village Corporation may require the Secretary to exchange such lands for: (1) other specified lands; or (2) an amount equal to the fair market value for lease of such lands. Authorizes such appropriations as necessary for this purpose."
