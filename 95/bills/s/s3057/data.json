Limits eligibility for such credit to residential users, hospitals, churches, and educational institutions. Limits the amount of allowable credit to $75 for an individual taxpayer. Reduces the amount of allowable credit by 75 percent of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of such individual exceeds $20,000. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to refund in advance one-fourth of the taxpayer's tentative credit under this Act for the taxable year."
