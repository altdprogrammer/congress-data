    "text": "Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (S.B.A.) to make all final determinations regarding the responsibility of a small business to perform a specific Government contract. States that no Government procurement officer may preclude any small business from being awarded a Government contract for lack of responsibility without referring the matter to the S.B.A. Directs any procurement officer who finds an otherwise qualified small business ineligible due to provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act to notify the SBA of such finding. Empowers the SBA to either dismiss such finding and direct the procurement officer to award the contract or if in agreement with such finding to forward the matter to the Department of Labor for final disposition. Renders any SBA certification of competency conclusive and requires that a certified contractor be awarded that specific Government contract."
