    "text": "Federal Tort Claims Amendments - Prohibits disciplinary action against an official of the United States because the official has (1) expressed an opinion or judgment with respect to the conduct or operation of any Federal agency, (2) disclosed any information not specifically protected by law, or (3) given any testimony or disclosed any information in response to a request or direction of Congress or a court notwithstanding any law prohibiting such disclosure or testimony. Creates a presumption that disciplinary action was taken as a result of such conduct upon showing that the action was taken within 18 months after the conduct. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize disclosure made with knowledge that the information is false or made under circumstances constituting a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. Entitles an official who is injured as a result of a violation of the prohibition against disciplinary action to money damages and other appropriate relief from the person taking the action and the United States, jointly and severally. Specifies procedural rules relative to such civil actions."
