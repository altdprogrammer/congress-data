Provides a procedure for the correction of account errors. Excuses a customer of liability for unauthorized use of his debit instrument unless the debit instrument issuer can establish customer fraud or negligence. Sets forth liability for system malfunction. Provides civil liability for willful violation of this Act and criminal liability for fraudulent use of debit instruments. Makes bank regulatory agencies and the Federal Trade Commission responsible for administrative enforcement of the terms of this Act."
