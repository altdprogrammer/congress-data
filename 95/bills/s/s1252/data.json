Transfers to the Service all functions, powers, duties, and authority of the Passport Office of the Department of State, together with those funds, liabilities, commitments, authorizations, allocations, personnel, properties, and records of the Department of State which the Secretary of State shall determine to be primarily related to, and necessary for, the exercise of such functions, powers, duties, and authority. Provides for the appointment of a Director and enumerates his duties and responsibilities. Establishes a fund for the Service. States that the fund shall be capitalized on the basis of: (1) an initial appropriation by the Congress to the fund of a sum of at least $59,700,000; and (2) any unexpended balances of appropriations, the inventories, and other physical assets of the Passport Office (exclusive of buildings occupied and land). Prohibits fiscal year limitations upon use of the fund for financing the direct cost and expenses of operating and maintaining the Service."
