    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H.R. 13553) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, notwithstanding the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, to issue leases for coal on Federal lands (1) in the State of Utah to specified lease applicants upon surrender and relinquishment of such preference right lease applications and all rights to lease such lands and (2) in the State of Wyoming to listed owners of Federal coal leases upon the surrender and relinquishment of portions or all of such leases. Permits the Secretary to equalize the value of the rights to leases and leases authorized to be exchanged by receiving or paying out of available funds no more than 25 percent of the value of the leases to be issued by the Secretary. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to authorize the Secretary to sell coal which may be removed incidental to the exercise of a right-of-way permit at fair market value, notwithstanding competitive bidding requirements. Permits the Secretary to adjust the boundaries of an existing coal lease by adding thereto not more than 160 acres of additional coal lands or coal deposits cornering or contiguous to those lands embraced in such lease. Allows the Secretary not to apply the minimum royalty and production requirements of the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1975 to land covered by the lease prior to such modification until the term of the original lease has expired. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to exchange mineral interests in Federal lands for privately owned minearl interests and (2) to sell federally owned mineral interests. Repeals the provision of such Act which prohibits women miners in underground mines on Federal lands. Directs the Secretary to study whether privately owned coal properties in the Lake DeSmet area of Johnson County, Wyoming, should be acquired for their recreational, scenic, and wildlife values by exchange for Federal coal lands. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) acquire such interests if the Secretary finds that such exchanges should be made; and (2) transfer the properties to the State for recreational purposes and fish and wildlife management. Authorizes appropriations as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act."
