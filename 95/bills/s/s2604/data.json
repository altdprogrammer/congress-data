Exempts tire retreaders from certain reporting requirements of such Act. =Title II: Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings= - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1979, 1980, and 1981, to carry out the provisions of such Act. Permits the Secretary of Transportation, based upon certain findings, to temporarily exempt or renew the exemption of motor vehicles from the bumper standards required by such Act. Directs the Secretary to require permanent labeling of each exempted vehicle.

Limits a manufacturer's eligibility in applying for an exemption under specified criteria to 2,500 vehicles to be sold in the United States in any 12-month period, as determined by the Secretary. Requires that any manufacturer applying for an exemption to submit a detailed analysis to support the claim for the need for such exemption.
