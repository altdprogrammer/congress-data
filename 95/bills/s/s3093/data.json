Rept. 95-1276) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles, and aircraft used to illegally transport aliens into the United States. Exempts vehicles from seizure: (1) when the owner or other person in charge was not a consenting party to the alleged act; or (2) when such vehicle was in the illegal possession of someone other than the owner. Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations providing for the return of such vehicles to the owner or other person in charge. Provides for such seizure without a warrant if the Attorney General has probable cause to believe such illegal transport occurred and a warrant is not constitutionally required."
