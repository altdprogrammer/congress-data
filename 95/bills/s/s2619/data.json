    "text": "Peace Corps Act Amendments - Amends the Peace Corps Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980, to carry out such Act, and such sums as may be necessary for employee benefits authorized by law for fiscal years 1979 and 1980. Directs the Peace Corps Act to be administered so as to encourage the economic integration of women in developing countries. Repeals the requirement that only one Peace Corps volunteer who is a parent of a minor child may receive a readjustment allowance, even though both parents are volunteers eligible for such allowances. Makes the malpractice protection provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1977, applicable to the Peace Corps. Eliminates instruction in the philosophy and menace of Communism from required Peace Corps training. Authorizes the President to furnish hospitalization and medical treatment to Foreign Service local employees who are in the United States for training, under certain conditions."
