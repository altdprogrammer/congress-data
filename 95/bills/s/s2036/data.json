Title II: Amateur Sports Organization - Olympic Committee Charter Amendments Act - Amends the Olympic Committee's corporate charter to authorize it to certify and oversee national governing bodies for each sport which will negotiate and regulate United States participation in international amateur sporting events (except Olympic and Pan-American games), as well as promote domestic competitions. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to lend financial assistance to the Committee in developing amateur athletics in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the work of the national governing bodies. Title III: Athletes' Rights to Participate - Amateur Athlete's Bill of Rights Act - Provides that no athlete, school, organization, coach, trainer or the like shall be censured or deprived of the right to participate in international sporting events by a national governing body absent reasonable cause, or after participation is approved by a national body. Provides for enforcement of these rights, and for binding arbitration of disputes, through the American Arbitration Association and the United States district courts."
