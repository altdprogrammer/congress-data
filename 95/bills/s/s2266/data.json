Makes provisions for the late joining of creditors to the petition. Empowers the court under specified circumstances to enjoin the commencement or continuation of any action against the estate or the enforcement of any judgment against the estate; or to order other appropriate relief where an ancillary foreign proceeding has commenced or is likely to be commenced.

Specifies property of the debtor which is not available, during or after the case, for the satisfaction of any debt of the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case, except a debt which is not dischargeable. Invalidates any waiver of exemptions executed in favor of a creditor. Permits the debtor to avoid the fixing of specified liens including judicial liens and nonpurchase-money security interests in household goods, instruments of the debtor's trade, or a debtor's interest in property to the extent that such a lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor is entitled. Specifies circumstances under which the debtor may recover transferred property which could have been exempted. Requires the debtor to file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under this Act. Describes the effect of discharge as: (1) voiding any judgment obtained at any time, to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor; and (2) enjoining the commencement or continuation of an action or any act to collect, recover, or set-off any debt as a personal liability of the debtor or any specified interest in community property acquired after the commencement of the case.

Requires a municipality or public agency to meet specified conditions before it is eligible for relief under this chapter. States that a petition may be filed under this chapter by the municipality's officials, or in the case of an unincorporated tax or special assessment district by such district's governing authority or body having authority to levy taxes to meet the obligations of such district. Sets forth procedures for objection to such petition and states that the filing of a petition operates as a stay of the commencement or continuation of a judicial or other proceeding that seeks to enforce a lien arising out of taxes or assessments owed to the debtor. Requires the debtor to submit a list of creditors. Reserves the court's power to dismiss after notice and a hearing, for cause, such as want of prosecution, or failure to propose or accept a plan for the adjustment of the debtor's debts within the time fixed or extended by the court. Requires dismissal if confirmation of such plan is refused. Provides for the appointment by the court of a trustee to pursue a cause of action if the debtor refuses to do so. Sets priority expenses to be paid by the municipality. Requires the debtor to file a plan for the adjustment of the debts either at the time of the filing of the petition or at such later time as the court shall fix.

Grants the district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under Title 11 of the United States Code. States that notwithstanding any Act of Congress, that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the district court shall have original, but not exclusive jurisdiction, of all civil proceedings arising under or related to bankruptcy cases; however, such court may abstain from hearing a particular proceeding in the interest of justice. Gives a bankruptcy judge all powers of the district court except the powers of enjoining another court or imposing punishment for contempt of court. Places venue, for purposes of bankruptcy proceedings, in the judicial district which is either the domicile, residence, principal place of business, or situs of the principal assets of the debtor; or the site of a pending bankruptcy case concerning such debtor's affiliate, general partner, or partnership.
