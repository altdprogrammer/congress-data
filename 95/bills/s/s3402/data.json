    "text": "Individual Retirement Account Simplification Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the deadline for making contributions to an individual retirement account (IRA) to the date on which the taxpayer is required to file a tax return (including extensions) for the following year. Permits a taxpayer who makes a contribution to an IRA in excess of prescribed limits to apply such excess amount to a subsequent taxable year, for purposes of the income tax deduction. Permits an individual whose total contributions to an IRA do not exceed $1,750 to withdraw excess amounts before the close of the taxable year without penalty. Permits such individual to withdraw excess contributions without regard to the $1,750 limitation, if the contributions were made in reasonable reliance on erroneous information supplied by an employer. Requires that an individual retirement annuity contract provide that premiums not be fixed, that the annual premium not exceed $1,500, and that any refund of premiums be applied to the payment of future premiums or the purchase of additional benefits. Permits a participant in a tax-exempt employer pension plan to transfer less than the entire amount distributed from such a plan to an individual retirement account (IRA). Allows an individual who receives all or part of a lump sum distribution from an employer plan in the form of stock or other property to sell all or part of the property and rollover the proceeds to an IRA. Permits a surviving spouse of an employer plan participant to rollover distributions from such a plan into an IRA. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to waive penalties on excess IRA accumulations if such accumulations result from a reasonable error by the taxpayer. Removes the limitation on the amount of an excess contribution which may be corrected through a distribution prior to the date for filing a tax return. Eliminates the separate individual reporting requirements for certain IRA's to which no special individual retirement plan tax is applicable for the taxable year."
