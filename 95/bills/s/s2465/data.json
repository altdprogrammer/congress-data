Title II: National Wildlife Refuge System - Establishes specified areas in Alaska as units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Illiamna watershed be managed for the primary purposes of watershed protection and fishery production. Authorizes the Secretary of Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the State of Alaska concerning management of the State and Federal lands within the Illiamna watershed. Allows the Secretary to convey Federal lands within the watershed to Alaska under certain circumstances. Requires the Secretary to determine, before any such conveyance, that the appropriate legislation has been enacted by the State of Alaska and that the State is ready, willing, and able to implement a program to protect and manage the watershed for the primary purposes of watershed protection and fishery production. Allows the Secretary to designate misused lands within the Illiamna watershed as units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Requires the Secretary, before such designation, to provide the Governor of Alaska with notice of such misuse and allow the State 90 days to remedy the situation. Title III: National Wild and Scenic Rivers System - Lists rivers in Alaska which shall be wild rivers for purposes of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Designates other rivers for study for inclusion as wild and scenic rivers. Title IV: National Forest System - Adds specified lands to the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Alaska.

Provides for the withdrawal of designated lands from appropriation under mining and mineral leasing laws. Delineates the rights of native corporations with respect to designated lands. Establishes the Alaska Cooperative Planning Commission to advise interested parties concerning the use and management of designated lands.
