Requires the Secretary, acting through the National Center for Health Statistics or its equivalent, to submit to Congress on January 1, 1981, and on January 1 of every third year thereafter, a national disease prevention data profile in order to provide a data base for the effective implementation of this Act and to increase public awareness of the prevalence, incidence, and any trends in the preventable causes of death and disability in the United States. Title III: Amendments to the Food Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to Foster Health Promotion - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the publication of additional nutritional information on food package labels. Authorizes exemptions from such guidelines if the Secretary finds that a satisfactory labeling requirement of a State or a political subdivision is required by compelling local conditions. Includes distilled spirits, wines, and malt beverages in the definition of food for purposes of the Act. Directs the Secretary to notify the Federal Trade Commission of the nutritional information required to be on food labels, and to recommend to the Commission which of such information should be required to be included in the advertising of labeled food.

Requires smokers to be effectively separated from nonsmokers in any restaurant, cafeteria, snackbar, or lounge in any Federal facility. Requires each instrumentality of the United States: (1) to use reasonable efforts to effectively separate the workplaces of its employees who do not smoke and who wish to be so separated from the workplaces of its employees who do smoke; and (2) to insure the effective separation of smoking and nonsmoking employees in planning, designing, purchasing, leasing, or otherwise obtaining new facilities. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to impose a health protection tax on every cigarette manufactured in or imported into the United States based on the number of toxic units, as defined in the Act, contained in the cigarette. Authorizes the appropriation of those amounts received from such taxes for use in the provision of preventive health services under the Public Health Service Act.
