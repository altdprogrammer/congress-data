Stipulates that there shall be only three Federal-aid highway system: the rural system, the urban system, and the Interstate System. Stipulates that funding for such systems shall be made through the normal authorization and appropriation process. Stipulates that funds authorized and appropriated for the urban and rural system shall be available either for highway construction and maintenance or for construction and operating subsidies for mass transit systems. Stipulates that the Federal share for projects on the urban, rural, and Interstate systems shall be 90 percent of the costs of such a project. Requires the Governors of each State to develop a comprehensive program for the utilization of Federal funds under this Act. Stipulates that such programs must meet specified criteria. Requires that such a program be administered by a single State agency. Stipulates that the Secretary of Transportation's disapproval of such a plan shall be subject to judicial review. Stipulates that urban system funds shall be apportioned to the States on the basis of population and the rural system funds shall continue to be apportioned on the basis of mileage, land area, and population.
