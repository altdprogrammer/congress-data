    "text": "Establishes a national dam safety program. Directs each Federal agency to regulate the safety of dams which are either owned by the United States and operated by the agency involved, or which are located on lands owned by the United States for which the involved agency is responsible. Allows Federal agencies to enter into agreements with States to permit State enforcement of a State dam safety program for those dams within the State owned by a non-Federal entity. Requires Federal agencies to examine, inspect, and repair specified dams within their jurisdiction. Directs such agencies to: (1) review plans for dam construction or modification; (2) inspect performance of such work; (3) retain data of such construction; and (4) issue certificates of approval. Requires such Federal agencies to issue regulations for dam safety in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary of the Army. Makes compliance with this Act and applicable regulations a requirement for construction and operation of dams subject to this Act. Directs the Secretaries of the Army, the Interior, and Agriculture to furnish aid and advice to States requesting assistance in implementation of dam safety programs."
