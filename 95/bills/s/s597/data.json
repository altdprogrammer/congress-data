    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to redefine the term \"navigable waters\" as it applies to permits for dredged or fill material as required by the Act. Allows the discharge of dredged or fill materials without a permit in waters other than navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Corps of Engineers, to enter into agreements with States to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters other than navigable waters and in wetlands other than adjacent wetlands. Exempts farming, silviculture, ranching, forestry and specified construction activities from permit requirements with respect to discharges of dredged or fill material. Stipulates that Federal projects shall be exempt only if the effects of such discharges have been assessed pursuant to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Corps of Engineers, to delegate authority over dredged and fill material in adjacent wetlands to the States."
