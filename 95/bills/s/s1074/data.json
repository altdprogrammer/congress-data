Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a rehabilitation and protection program with respect to such rangelands. Declares the goals of such program to be (1) the correction of the deficiencies in, and the rehabilitation of, inventoried rangelands within 30 years of the enactment of this Act, and (2) the subsequent maintenance or improvement of the productive capacity of such lands consistent with the resource values identified in this Act and with the multiple use, sustained yield concept of land management. Requires the Secretary to prepare a rangelands report one year after enactment of this Act and thereafter at three year intervals."
