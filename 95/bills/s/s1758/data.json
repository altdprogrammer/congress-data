Title II: Excessive Profits Tax - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to encourage the reinvestment of fossil fuels profits by: (1) applying an additional 80 percent income tax for the five tax years ending before 1982, against either the taxpayer's fossil fuels profits which exceed his average profits during 1970-74, or 15 percent of his capital investment, whichever is greater; and (2) offering a cumulative credit against this temporary tax for funds invested in developing any energy sources."
