    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make payments from the annual franchise fees received by the Secretary from concession facilities at the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, to the appropriate school district or districts serving that park as reimbursement for educational facilities (and transportation where appropriate) furnished by such district to pupils who are dependents of persons employed in connection with such park and living at or near the park upon real property of the United States not subject to taxation by State or local agencies. Directs that such payments for any school year shall not exceed that part of the cost of operating such educational facilities which the number of such dependent pupils bears to the whole number of pupils in average daily attendance at these schools. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with States or local agencies for: (1) operation of school facilities; (2) construction and expansion of local facilities at Federal expense; and (3) Federal contribution to cover the increased cost to local agencies of providing such educational services if the payments authorized above are inadequate. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain a portion of the annual franchise fees from such concession facilities in a special fund, and to expend such money upon certification by the Secretary of the Interior."
