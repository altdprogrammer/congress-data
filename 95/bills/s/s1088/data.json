States that those funds that are ineligible for beneficial programs shall be placed in the U.S. Treasury for the credit of the Osage Indian Tribe and distributed to individual members of the tribe in the same manner as interest payments on money held in trust. Authorizes the use of unclaimed individual shares of funds restored to the tribe for the benefit of the tribe."
