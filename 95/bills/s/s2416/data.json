Authorizes the Secretary to extend the period for which service may be deferred for National Health Service Corps scholarship recipients. Eliminates the present requirement that each medical and osteopathic school participating in the area health education centers (AHEC) program shall conduct a program for the training of nurse practitioners or physician assistants. Provides that if one medical or osteopathic school participating in the AHEC programs conducts the training program, other schools participating in the AHEC programs would not be required to conduct such a training program. Amends the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act to extend the authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1981 to AHEC program participants to improve the distribution, supply, quality and efficiency of health personnel and the health services delivery system. Amends Title VIII (Health Research and Teaching Facilities and Training of Professional Health Personnel) to authorize the appropriation of $10,000,000 (formerly $5,000,000) for fiscal years 1978 and 1979 for grants and contracts for financially distressed health professions training institutions. training institutions."
