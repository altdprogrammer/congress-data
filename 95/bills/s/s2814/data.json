Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay each State, political subdivision thereof, and each tax-exempt organization investing in certain depreciable property a sum equal to 25 percent of the amount of the investment credit such tax-exempt entity would be allowed if liable for tax. Allows for years between December 31, 1978, and January 1, 1984, an investment credit for certain depreciable property including buildings and their structural components if such property is placed in service in a high-unemployment area."
