    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-1478) Amtrak Improvement Act - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize appropriations for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation for fiscal year 1979. Repeals the provision of such Act prohibiting mandatory review by officers or agencies of the United States of legislative recommendations made by the Corporation. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation with the Corporation, to develop a preliminary recommendation for a route system for the Corporation which will provide an optimal intercity railroad passenger system based on current and future market and population requirements. Specifies considerations which the Secretary is to consider in formulating such recommendations and specifies provisions to be included in such report. Directs the Rail Services Planning Office to conduct public hearings on the Secretary's recommendations and to submit its findings to the Secretary. Directs the Office of Rail Public Counsel to provide legal services in order to protect the interests of communities and users of rail passenger service during such hearings. Requires the Secretary to thoroughly consider such material in developing final recommended route system for the Corporation. Directs the Secretary to submit such final recommendations to both Houses of Congress and to specified committees. Stipulates that such recommendations shall be deemed approved within 90 days unless either the House of Representatives or the Senate adopts a resolution disapproving such recommendations. Directs the Corporation after such approval to complete the implementation of such basic route system within 12 months. Suspends the Discontinuance of Services requirements and the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) Adequacy of Service regulations regarding the final plan. Prescribes that the approved final plan shall supersede any other system or route previously in effect. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the conflicts between the needs of commuter and and intercity rail passenger service in the Northeast Corridor and on the allocation of access rights to key terminals in such area. Requires the Comptroller General to study the economic relationship of the fare structure of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to the intercity bus industry. Gives the Interstate Commerce Commission, upon the application of any aggrieved motor carrier, jurisdiction over any rate, fare, charge or marketing practice of the Corporation respecting any route or service operating at a loss for the purpose of hearing the complaint over an unfair or predatory practice. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to establish maximum travel times between points in the Northeast Corridor. Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to develop economical and reliable rolling stock and related equipment designed to be compatible with the track, and operating and marketing characteristics of the Northeast Corridor. Stipulates that the Secretary must concur on equipment purchases. Sets aside $27,000,000 from the sums authorized to be appropriated for the Northeast Corridor to finance the costs of equipment modification and replacement which States will be required to bear as a result of the electrification conversion system of the Northeast Corridor. Requires the Corporation to purchase only unmanufactured articles, materials, supplies which have been: (1) mined or produced in the United States; and (2) manufactured in the United States substantially from materials from the United States. Sets forth specified exceptions to such requirements. Requires the Corporation to be operated and managed as a for-profit organization. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to evaluate the common stock ownership of the Corporation and to submit a report to Congress setting forth recommendations with respect to retention, retirement, or conversion of such common stock. Requires the Corporation to develop and implement a Rail Safety System Program for employees working on property owned by the Corporation. Provides that the Federal share of projects for the conversion of intercity passenger train terminals into intermodal passenger terminals, or community and cultural centers, shall be increased from 60 to 80 percent. Directs the ICC to include tracks and facilities in fixing compensation for costs under certain provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act. Provides reimbursement for staff services to a State or agency which has entered into an agreement with the Corporation for rail passenger service. Permits certain agencies to petition the ICC for an order directing the Corporation to comply with a request for modification of service agreements. Authorizes the Corporation to operate commuter rail passenger service under an agreement with a State if such State agrees to reimburse the Corporation for the avoidable cost of operating such commuter rail passenger service. Directs the Corporation to utilize all feasible means to attract and service the bulk mail needs of the Postal Service."
