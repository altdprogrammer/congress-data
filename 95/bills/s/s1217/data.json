    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-359) Recombinant DNA Safety Regulation Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new title establishing within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the National Recombinant DNA Safety Regulation Commission. Sets forth the composition, duties, and functions of the Commission. Stipulates that no person may engage in recombinant DNA activities in the United States unless such activities are conducted in a licensed facility. Sets forth assurances that must be made to the Commission in any license application, including certification of adequate employee training and certification of permission for inspections. States that any license issued by the Commission must specify: (1) the names and addresses of persons authorized to engage in recombinant DNA activities; (2) a description of the activities authorized to be conducted by such facility; and (3) such additional safety information as the Commission may require. Sets forth procedures for the issuance and renewal of licenses. Directs the Commission to promulgate final regulations with respect to recombinant DNA activities. Requires the Commission to promulgate regulations to implement the license requirements of this Act within 90 days after the promulgation of such final regulations. Specifies that the licensing regulations shall: (1) prescribe required laboratory safety techniques; and (2) provide for Institutional Biohazards Review Committees at each facility. States that recombinant DNA projects to be undertaken by a facility must be reviewed and approved by the committees to assure adequate containment levels and safety procedures. Directs the Commission, within two years after the enactment of this Act, to prepare and transmit to Congress a study identifying the basic ethical and scientific principles which should underlie the conduct and use of recombinant DNA activities. Prescribes the criteria for license revocation, suspension, or limitation. Authorizes inspections to be made of research facilities to determine if such facility is violating any of the provisions of this Act. Requires the owner or operator of a licensed facility to maintain and submit to the Commission such records, reports, and samples related to the safety of recombinant DNA activities as the Commission may require. Specifies the following as prohibited acts: (1) the failure to comply with Commission regulations and licensing requirements; (2) the refusal to maintain or permit access to any record, sample, or report required by this Act; (3) the refusal to permit inspection as authorized by this Act; (4) the refusal to comply with license conditions or limitations; and (5) the failure to register a DNA project in accordance with this Act. Subjects the violators to a civil penalties. Specifies the procedures for assessment of such penalties. Authorizes an inspector to seize or destroy any recombinant DNA materials believed to be hazardous, in accordance with Commission procedures. Permits the Commission to commence a civil action in an appropriate district court for the seizure of such materials. Grants to the district courts jurisdiction over civil action to enjoin violations of this Act. Declares that it is the intent of Congress to supersede all laws of the States and political subdivisions with requirements concerning recombinant DNA. Provides for an exemption if the State or political subdivision requirement: (1) is more stringent than the requirement of this Act; (2) is relevant to health and environmental concerns of such State or subdivision; and (3) is such that compliance will not result in a violation of this Act. Provides for judicial review of the licensing procedure in the United States court of appeals. Prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee because such employee has commenced, participated in, or testified in a proceeding under this Act. Authorizes employees who believe they have been discharged or disciplined to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Provides that trade secret information obtained by the Commission which is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act may only be disclosed to: (1) officers or employees of the United States in connection with health protection or law enforcement; (2) contractors with the Commission if disclosure is necessary for the satisfactory performance of the work of such contractors; (3) specified persons if necessary to protect health or environment against an unreasonable risk; or (4) specified persons when relevant in any proceeding under this Act. Sets forth procedures to be followed in releasing such data and provides penalties for willful and unauthorized disclosure of data. Directs the owner or operator of a licensed facility to file with the Commission a Project Registration Statement for each recombinant DNA project conducted in the facility. Declares that, with certain exceptions, no Federal agency may impose or continue any safety or health requirement applicable to recombinant DNA activities that is different from or in addition to any requirement prescribed in this Act. Authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act in fiscal years 1978-1982."
