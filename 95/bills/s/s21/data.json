Directs the Secretary to give priority to small business and hazardous workplaces. Stipulates that no consultative visit made under this Act may serve as an inspection or investigation as otherwise provided for by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, except: (1) in the case of an employer who fails to eliminate a danger disclosed during such a visit: or (2) if conditions are found during such a visit which indicate the probability that death or serious harm could result to employees therefrom, the Secretary may notify the employer of such conditions and afford him a reasonable time to eliminate such conditions. Prohibits the transmission of information obtained during a consultative visit to representatives of the Secretary engaged in enforcement. Directs the Secretary to establish education programs to inform employers and employees of the hazards in particular industries. Authorizes the appropriation of funds through fiscal year 1978 for the purposes of this Act."
