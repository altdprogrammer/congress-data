    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, S. Rept. 95-934) Antitrust Enforcement Act - Amends the Clayton Act to provide that whether or not the antitrust plaintiff has dealt directly with the defendant shall not bar or otherwise limit recovery. Entitles the defendant in an antitrust action, under defined circumstances, to reduce liability to a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs, or prove complete defense to a damage claim, by showing that the plaintiff had been able to pass all or part of the cost of injury to third parties, who are able to recover the plaintiff's damage. Makes this Act applicable to certain actions commenced under the Clayton Act pending on or after June 9, 1977. Provides for certain limitations on foreign sovereign governments to bring suits in United States courts for antitrust violations. Limits such foreign governments to actual damages. Requires certification by the Attorney General of the United States that such governments prohibit restrictive trade practices by their own laws. Stipulates that the United States must be entitled to sue in its own name and on its own behalf on a civil claim in the courts of such foreign sovereign."
