Sets the interest rate for all other loans made with respect to a physical disaster occurring on or after July 1, 1976, at five percent. Cancels a portion of the principal of disaster loans made with regard to a primary residence which has incurred damage of at least ten percent of its fair market value. Authorizes the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to defer interest payments on certain disaster loans for up to three years."
