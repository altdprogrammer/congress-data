    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1977-06-23", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) National Mass Transportation Assistance Act - Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to make grants up to $10,925,000,000 for urban transportation programs under the Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to fulfill such grant obligations. Mandates that, of those funds available to finance activities under this Act, $500,000,000 shall be available exclusively for assistance in areas not designated as \"urban areas\" by the Bureau of the Census. Authorizes the appropriation of $4,750,000,000 for urban transportation grants through fiscal year 1982. Authorizes the Secretary to announce approval of multiyear projects and an intent to obligate funds for such projects from budget authority to be made available in future years. Sets aside the first $400,000,000 appropriated for urban transportation grants for the purchase of mass transportation equipment. Authorizes the appropriation of an additional $125,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 for the purpose of making grants to finance capital and operating costs. Expands the basic formula grant by creating a supplemental source of funds, for high impact areas, derived from two sources: (1) an additional $50,000,000 authorization for each fiscal year through 1980, and (2) an estimated $145,000,000 in funds remaining unobligated for two years, to be \"recycled\" into additional operating assistance. Removes the restrictions imposed on the fellowship assistance grants for managerial training programs with regard to: (1) the annual limitation on the number of grants; (2) the limitation on the number of fellowships awarded to any one State; and (3) the exclusion of private transit company employees from receiving fellowships. Authorizes the use of mass transportation capital grant funds for preliminary engineering of mass transportation projects. Requires the Secretary to convert two outstanding mass transit loans into capital grants, compute the local matching share that would have been required had such loan been the Federal share of a project, and to provide in the grant agreement that the locality will contribute such computed amount to mass transportation projects within the urbanized area. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress by February 1, 1980, and February 1, 1982, a detailed estimate of urban mass transportation funding. Extends from March 30, 1978, to March 30, 1980, the termination date for 50 percent emergency operating assistance for commuter rail service affected by the northwestern railroad reorganization. Provides operating assistance funds to rail commuter services which are not eligible for such emergency operating assistance. Authorizes to be appropriated not to exceed $545,000,000 to carry out the functions of the Secretary required under such Act."
