Revises the procedures for operation and repair of navigation projects. Repeals the prohibition against tolls on navigation projects. Requires the Secretary of the Army (1) to include information on failure possibilities in reports to Congress on water impoundment projects, and (2) to describe recreation facilities in the area of any proposed public works project which includes recreation benefits. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prepare the calculations on transportation-related benefits for proposed water resources projects of the Corps of Engineers. Deauthorizes any survey of the Corps of Engineers for which no funds are expended within four years following its approval. Directs the Secretary of the Army to list all inactive surveys. Permits the deauthorization of such surveys. Establishes a Water Resources Mitigation Advisory Board to evaluate complaints with respect to any existing or potential water resources project. Authorizes the appropriation of $250,000 for fiscal year 1978 for such Board."
