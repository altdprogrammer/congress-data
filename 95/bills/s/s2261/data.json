    "text": "Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act - Permits the President to enter into agreements with other countries to apply import restrictions on certain archaeological or ethnological material of other countries. Authorizes the President to impose such restriction for a temporary period if he determines that an emergency condition exists with respect to such material. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to promulgate a list of archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party covered by an agreement or emergency action entered into under this Act. Establishes a Cultural Property Advisory Committee to review the effectiveness of such agreements. Requires the President, upon the request of a State Party for such import restrictions, to publish notification of the request, to submit such request to the Committee for its recommendations on the imposition of such restrictions, and to take such recommendations into account in the determination of such restrictions. Requires the President, when considering the report of the Committee, to submit to Congress the text of the agreement and a statement giving the reasons for any differences between the action taken by the President and those recommended by the Committee. Prohibits the importation of any listed article into the United States unless the State Party certifies that the exportation of such article was not in violation of the laws of the State Party. Prohibits the importation of any cultural property appertaining to the inventory of a museum or similar institution in any State Party which is stolen after the effective date of this Act or after entry into an agreement with such State Party. Sets forth procedures for temporary disposition, seizure, and forfeiture of property under this Act, including return to the State Party and temporary retention by public museums in the United States. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary to carry out this Act. Exempts certain material and articles from the provisions of this Act."
