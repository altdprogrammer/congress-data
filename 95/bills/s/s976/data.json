    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Amends the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act to raise the maximum license fee for commission merchants, dealers, and brokers from $100 to $150 plus $50 for each branch or additional business facility a license applicant operates in excess of nine such facilities. Sets a maximum annual aggregate of such fees for any applicant at $1,000. Raises from $100,000 to $200,000 the minimum invoice value of specified goods any person must buy, or sell, or negotiate the sale of, in order to be deemed a dealer or broker. Includes as a \"dealer\" any person who buys potatoes for canning and/or processing, unless such potatoes are bought for processing solely within the State where grown. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to assess a single uniform license fee for all applicants or a graduated fee based on the amount or type of business conducted by the applicant or both. Limits the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Fund for any fiscal year to approximately 25 percent of the projected budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Amends the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963 to exempt from the registration requirements anyone who would be required to register solely because he was engaged in transporting \"migrant workers,\" solely for the purpose of supplying full-time students (or others whose principal occupation is not farming) to detassel hybrid seed corn or sorghum for seed, and to engage in other incidental farmwork for not to exceed four weeks in any calendar year, provided such students or persons are not required by such activity to be away from home overnight, and that such persons, if under 18, are not providing the transportation in the contractor's vehicles."
