Provides that the automatic cost-of-living increases in benefits which are authorized under Title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act may be made on a semiannual basis (rather than only on an annual basis as at present). Modifies the Social Security retirement test by revising the formula for determination of an individual's yearly excess earnings."
