    "text": "Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make annual grants to assist States in carrying out public shoreline erosion management measures in the Great Lakes region. Authorizes grants to States to: (1) acquire private shoreline property where necessary to protect adjacent public land; (2) relocate existing structures endangered by erosion; and (3) carry out erosion management measures. Limits the amount of any such grant to 80 percent of the estimated cost of a State's proposed erosion management measures during the year such grant is made. Requires a State, as a condition of eligibility for such a grant, to implement an erosion management assistance plan approved by the Secretary. Sets forth the types of financial aid which a State erosion management assistance plan must provide to private shoreline property owners. Requires a State to furnish the Secretary with information and records concerning its erosion management assistance plan. Directs the Secretary, in allocating aid among the States, to consider: (1) the length of the Great Lakes shoreline within each State; (2) comparative recession rates of each shoreline; and (3) the proportion of shoreline in each State which is subject to high erosion. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
