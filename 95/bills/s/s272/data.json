    "text": "Natural Gas Conservation ACt - Amends the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to authorize the Federal Energy Administrator to prohibit powerplants or major fuel-burning installations from using natural gas where adequate alternatives exist. Requires that such orders not take effect unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has certified that such plants will comply with the Clean Air Act. Directs the Federal Energy Administrator, in conjunction with the Federal Power Commission, to submit to Congress a National plan to prohibit or discourage use of natural gas to the maximum extent possible. Establishes the objective of eliminating all nonessential uses of natural gas by January 1, 1985. Requires that such plan include a study of the effects of a prohibition of boiler fuel use of natural gas."
