States that the elements of such process shall include: (1) information development and assessment to determine rural and nonmetropolitan conditions, problems, needs, and opportunities at the national, multistate, State and substate levels, and the impact of governmental policies and program actions thereupon; (2) the formulation of broad, long-range rural development goals; (3) the establishment of short-range rural development strategies and program objectives; and (4) periodic progress reports. Amends the Rural Development Act of 1972 to require, in place of the annual reports currently mandated: (1) an appraisal every five years of rural conditions, needs, problems, and opportunities; and (2) a biennial report on progress toward attaining national rural development goals. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, not to exceed $50,000,000 annually, to State government and State government- designated area planning bodies to assist in establishing and maintaining the rural development policy management process.
