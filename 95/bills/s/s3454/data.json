Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned for such fiscal year to retire and grant retired pay to disabled members of the armed forces whose disability was incurred in the line of duty from September 15, 1978 through September 30, 1979 if the President issues an Executive Order to such effect. Authorizes the temporary promotion of unrestricted Naval line officers in the grade of lieutenant who possess skills in critical shortage, and are serving in lieutenant commander billets, to the grade of lieutenant commander. Stipulates that such spot promotions shall be made by the President alone and the authority to make such appointments shall expire on September 30, 1979. Authorizes temporary major generals in the Marine Corps to sit on selection boards convened to select brigadier generals to the grade of major general. Authorizes the temporary promotion of Navy and Marine Corps officers designated for limited duty. Terminates such authority after September 30, 1979."
