    "text": "Small Communities Act - Title I: Findings and Purposes - States that the purpose of this Act is the simplification of the administrative and financial burdens on small communities in complying with the requirements of Federal assistance programs. Title II: Definitions - Defines terms used in this Act. Defines a \"small community\" as a county, city, town, township, or other community with a population of less than 50,000. Title III: Administration of Generally Applicable Federal Assistance Requirements - Defines \"generally applicable requirements\" as requirements which are placed on assistance recipients by Federal legislation or administrative rules and regulations, and which apply to two or more assistance programs. Directs the President to designate Federal agencies to establish standard rules and regulations for, and to report on the implementation of, generally applicable requirements in the areas of: (1) labor practices; (2) equal employment opportunity; (3) public employee standards; (4) equal services requirements based on prohibitions of discrimination; (5) access to government information; (6) citizen participation; (7) environmental protection; (8) relocation and real property acquisition; and (9) procurement standards when such requirements are part of a Federal assistance program. Permits a State or local government to certify to the Federal department or agency administering an assistance program that such government is in compliance with standard rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Act or with equivalent State or local rules. Provides for the rescission of such certification by the Federal body upon its finding that the government is not, in fact, in compliance. Title IV: Advance Appropriations - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish procedures for budgeting appropriations for multiyear programs of Federal financial assistance one year before the fiscal year in which the funds are to be spent. Title V: Consolidation of Federal Assistance Programs - Requires the President to examine, from time to time, the various Federal assistance programs and to determine what consolidations are necessary to improve the administration, efficiency, and economy of such programs. Directs the President, upon finding that a consolidation of programs is necessary, to designate a single Federal agency to administer the consolidated program. States that the agency chosen must have been in charge of at least one of the programs involved in the consolidation. Title VI: Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations - Increases from 26 to 29 the membership of the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations by providing for the appointment by the President to the Committee of three elected officials of small communities. Title VII: Flexible Grants Formulas - Directs the President to establish procedures for effective consultation among representatives of small communities, Congress, and the executive branch concerning the needs of small communities. Title VIII: Regulatory Flexibility - Authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to waive any rule, regulation, or order of any instrumentality of the United States except a Federal court. Title IX: Small Communities Contracts - Permits small communities to obtain assistance or services by contract with other communities or instrumentalities of State or local government. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish guidelines and procedures for such contracts. Title X: Small Community Set-Aside; Cash Grants - Authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish a procedure under which a small community could elect to receive a single cash grant in lieu of the grants presently received through various Federal assistance programs. States that a community selecting such single grant option would not have to meet any Federal requirements or standards imposed by the Federal Government. Title XI: Effect on Other Laws - States that this Act is in addition to the provisions of any other law or regulation under which any remedy or right of appeal is provided for any person, or any procedure is provided for the inquiry into or investigation of any matter. Title XII: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes the appropriation of such sums as are necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act. Title XIII: Financial Management of Federal Assistance Programs, General Financial Management - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish and maintain, for use by all Federal agencies, standard financial and other requirements for the administration of programs of financial assistance to State and local governments. States that such requirements shall include uniform financial reporting and application forms, standard terms, definitions, and conditions, and procedures for audits of grant programs. Sets forth measures to standardize audits of Federal financial programs. Requires a single audit of a State and local recipient of Federal financial assistance at least once every three years. Title XIV: Effective Dates - Establishes the dates on which specified Titles of this Act shall become effective."
