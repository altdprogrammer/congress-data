Requires the Secretary in making grants and contracts for family planning programs: (1) to give priority to alternatives to abortion projects; and (2) not to approve an application for funds which promotes or provides abortion services unless required to prevent the death of the mother. Requires State agencies, to be eligible for funds for family planning programs, to provide alternatives to abortion services. Requires any program receiving family planning program funds and any program which provides contraceptives to an unmarried minor to notify the parents of such minor that contraceptives are being provided. Requires that not less than 40 percent of the amounts appropriated for family planning programs be spent on alternatives to abortion programs. Requires any program receiving family planning program funds under this Act or the Social Security Act to inform each woman orally and in writing of the medical risks inherent for herself and for future pregnancies as a result of an abortion."
