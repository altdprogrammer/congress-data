Sets forth the information which a grant application must contain, including: (1) the incidence of adolescent pregnancy and related problems; (2) a description of existing services, needed services, and how they will be coordinated; (3) a description of any fee schedule to be used; (4) assurances that the applicant will demonstrate its financial responsibility and will make every effort to obtain State assistance and collect reimbursement from other sources; (5) assurances that acceptance by any individual of services under this Act shall be voluntary; and (6) assurances that core services shall be available through the grantee within a reasonable time after the grant is received. Requires grantees to report to the Secretary concerning their impact. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the provisions of this Act. Prohibits any funds to be used for abortions. =Title II: Improving Coordination of Federal and State Programs= - Directs the Secretary to coordinate Federal policies and programs which provide services designed to prevent unwanted adolescent pregnancies.
