Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to enforce such rule in the same manner as any other consumer product safety rule. Requires the Commission to promulgate a final rule if the Commission determines that the interim rule does not adequately protect the public. Requires the Commission to submit reports to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on its enforcement of this Act. Authorizes the Commission to require that any person required to comply with the certification requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act with respect to the manufacture of cellulose insulation use an independent third party's laboratory to do its testing for certification."
