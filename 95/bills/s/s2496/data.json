    "text": "State Department Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations for the Department of State for fiscal year 1979 for (1) the administration of foreign affairs, (2) international organizations and conferences, (3) international commissions, and (4) migration and refugee assistance. Permits the transfer of not more than ten percent of such funds. Authorizes appropriations for such Department for fiscal year 1980 to carry out its functions. Authorizes the Department of State to furnish assistance to destitute American citizens abroad. Removes expenditure limitations on the representation and entertainment expenses of the American Section, International Joint Commission, United States and Canada. Permits the working capital fund of the Department of State to be used for medical and health care services. Removes limitations upon certain monetary transfers to such fund, and stipulates accounting procedures with respect to such fund. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1946 with respect to the authority of the Secretary of State to establish non-Government-owned nonappropriated fund activities at post abroad. Requires equal rates to be charged to all Federal civilian personnel for such activities. Amends such Act to furnish medical and health care services (rather than first aid station) at post abroad."
