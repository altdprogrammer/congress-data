    "text": "Indian Program Evaluation and Needs Assessment Act - Makes findings that Federal agencies dealing with Indian affairs have not adequately furnished Congress with the information necessary to assess the needs of Indians and Alaskan Natives and that such lack of information has hampered Congress in determining such needs and responding to them. Title I: Program Expenditure Data - Requires the head of each Federal agency to develop procedures for compiling, maintaining, keeping current and reporting to Congress information concerning (1) the agency's annual expenditures for programs and services for which Indians are eligible; (2) services or programs specifically for the benefit of Indians; and (3) the agency's method of delivery of services and funding. Requires further that each Federal agency which administers programs which are specifically directed to or for the benefit of Indians and other programs for which Indians are eligible maintain and report to Congress information on the relative amounts expended for the administration of such programs and for actual services and funding to Indians and individual Indian organizations. Directs the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide Congress with a comprehensive record of land holdings and use patterns of Indian land. Requires the head of each Federal agency, in coordination with the Federal Interagency Council on Indian Affairs established by this Act, to conduct every five years a needs assessment program aimed at determining the actual needs and problems of Indians and Indian organizations that are eligible for the programs and services administered by each such agency. Title II: Federal Interagency Council On Indian Affairs - Establishes a Federal Interagency Council on Indian Affairs. Sets forth the duties of such Council in the development of a uniform format to be used by all Federal agencies in assessing the needs of Indians."
