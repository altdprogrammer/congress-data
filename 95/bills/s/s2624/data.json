Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the domestic production quantity of beef each quarter in order that the import quota may be determined. Directs the Secretary to establish a system for the equitable distribution of such quota among importers. Repeals current beef import quotas, and the authority of the President to suspend or increase such quota. Title II: Meat Import Labeling - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require that any imported meat or meat food product made in whole or in part of imported meat be labeled \"imported\", \"imported in part\", or with the name of the country of origin. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to assess exporters of meat to the United States for the cost of such labeling."
