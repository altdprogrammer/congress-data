    "text": "National Home Delivered Meals Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to establish a nutrition project for the elderly which, five or more days per week, provides at least one home-delivered hot meal which assures a minimum of one-third the daily recommended dietary allowances. Requires the State agencies administering the grant programs under which such nutrition projects are established to give preference in designating projects and awarding contracts or subcontracts, to the extent feasible, to existing meals-on-wheels projects. Directs the Commissioner on Aging to conduct a study of the effectiveness of the national home-delivered meals program. Directs the Commissioner to conduct a demonstration project involving at least three States to determine the feasibility of using shelf-stable and/or frozen meal systems for the elderly as a component or as a substitute in emergencies for regular nutrition projects assisted under this Act."
