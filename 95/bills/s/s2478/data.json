    "text": "National Rail Passenger Corporation Authorization Act - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to authorize appropriations for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation for fiscal year 1979. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation with the Corporation, to develop a preliminary recommendation for a route system for the Corporation which will provide an optimal intercity railroad passenger system based on current and future market and population requirements. Specifies considerations which the Secretary is to consider in formulating such recommendations and specifies provisions to be included in such report. Directs the Office of Rail Public Counsel to conduct public hearings on the Secretary's recommendations and to submit its findings to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to thoroughly consider such material in developing a final recommended route system for the Corporation. Directs the Secretary to submit such final recommendations to both Houses, of Congress and to specified committees. Stipulates that such recommendations shall be deemed approved within 60 days unless either the House of Representatives or the Senate adopts a resolution disapproving such recommendations. Directs the Corporation after such approval to complete the implementation of such basic route system within 12 months. Exempts such implementation from specified provisions of such Act. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to establish maximum travel times between points in the Northeast Corridor. Directs the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to develop economical and reliable rolling stock and related equipment designed to be compatible with the track, and operating and marketing characteristics of the Northeast Corridor. Directs the Interstate Commerce Commission in determining the compensation to be paid by the Corporation to other railroads or public transportation agencies for track or facility usage to limit such compensation to the avoidable costs of permitting the Corporation to use the railroad's or agency's tracks and facilities. Amends the Animal Welfare Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to exempt from the requirements of such Act the transportation of cats and dogs in passenger rail service upon a determination that such an exemption would result in an increase in reliable humane transport service for cats and dogs. Directs the Postal Service to utilize the services of the Corporation in the surface transportation of mail so long as it would not result in a significant deterioration of mail services or increase in costs to the Federal Government."
