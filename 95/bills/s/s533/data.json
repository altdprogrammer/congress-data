Includes within such demonstration projects, grants to employers in high unemployment areas for the purpose of retaining employees who would otherwise be laid off during periods of cyclical unemployment through improving the design of workplaces or work assignments or improving job skills. Directs the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the National Center for Productivity and Quality of Working Life, when requested by the Secretary, to provide technical assistance with respect to projects assisted pursuant to contracts under this Act. Establishes a Human Resources Advisory Council to furnish advice and assistance in the administration of such projects."
