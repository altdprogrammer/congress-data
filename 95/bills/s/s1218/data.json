    "text": "Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to direct that the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention assist in the preparation of the annual evaluation of, and the annual comprehensive plan for, Federal juvenile delinquency programs. Reduces to four the minimum number of Coordinating Council meetings per year. Revises the power of the Administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to delegate his authority under such Act. Eliminates direct formula grants to local governments under provisions relative to assistance for State and local delinquency programs. Permits the Federal contribution for projects by private nonprofit organizations assisted under such programs to equal 100 percent. Authorizes waiver of the non-Federal share cash matching requirement with respect to assisted activities. Revises provisions allowing use of formula funds to meet the matching share requirement of certain Federal delinquency-related grants. Modifies requirements for State plans which must be submitted in order to receive formula grants to (1) eliminate comprehensive drug and alcohol abuse programs from the group of priority programs for which 75 percent of assistance funds must be used and (2) make placement of juveniles who are charged with or have committed offenses which would not be criminal if committed by an adult in shelter facilities rather than in detention or correctional facilities optional rather than mandatory. Includes among the special emphasis prevention and treatment activities which may receive assistance development and support programs stressing advocacy aimed at improving services to youth impacted by the juvenile justice system. Authorizes the Administrator to increase the Federal share of the cost of any delinquency program or project funded by a grant to an Indian tribe. Repeals the prohibition against disclosure or transfer of records containing the identity of individual juveniles gathered for purposes of such Act. Incorporates into such Act certain administrative provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act to require that the chairman and at least two members of any juvenile delinquency advisory group established under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act be appointed to the State law enforcement and crime control planning council."
