    "text": "Federal Employee Protection Act - Adds Chapter 78, Protection of Employee Rights, to Title 5 of the United States Code. Prohibits the taking of any disciplinary action hereinafter referred to as prohibited disaplinary action against any Federal employee because such employee has disclosed to Congress, any agency, or the public information concerning an action by any Federal agency or another Federal employee which such disclosing employee reasonably believes to be illegal or improper. Limits the disclosure of classified or other sensitive information. Establishes the Merit Systems Protection Board with jurisdiction over allegations of prohibited disaplinary actions and agency or employee actions which are otherwise illegal or improper. Requires the Board to establish an office to confidentially counsel any employee who questions the propriety or legality of the action of any agency or employee. Establishes within the Board an Office of Special Counsel to investigate allegations of illegal or improper conduct and instances of prohibited disciplinary action. Authorizes the Special Counsel to order restoration of the status of an employee aggrieved by a prohibited disciplinary action, and to order the payment of actual damages to such employee which are caused by such action. Authorizes the Special Counsel to refer any apparent criminal violations to the Attorney General. Empowers the Special Counsel to file disciplinary charges with the Board against any employee."
