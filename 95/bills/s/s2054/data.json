Requires such projects to furnish initial and continuing recreation facilities and land and water areas therefor. Directs that such facilities be included in determinations of the economic benefits of such projects. Sets forth the requirements for the furnishing and administration of land and water areas associated with recreation and fish and wildlife purposes and the cost allocation procedures between Federal and non-Federal interests for such purposes. Exempts small boat harbor projects, national recreation area projects, and fish and wildlife projects from specified requirements of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act."
