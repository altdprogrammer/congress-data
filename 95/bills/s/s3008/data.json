Sets forth grant application requirements. Requires States submitting applications to acquire the land upon which the tailings and abandoned millsite are located prior to release of grant funds. Requires sale of the site within three years after restoration and payment or title transfer to the Secretary. Sets forth procedures for site restoration on Indian lands. Provides for direct restoration action by the Secretary upon a State's failure to act within three years or upon direct request. Makes the Secretary responsible, in such cases, for restoring background radiation levels, disposing of uranium mill tailings, and monitoring of site radiation levels. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish regulations assuring that the public health and the environment are not impaired by remedial actions taken pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct a pilot study of uranium mill site radiation in Salt Lake City, Utah,and report the findings to Congress."
