    "text": "Public Broadcasting Financing Act - Title I: Construction and Planning of Facilities - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to establish new procedures for the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities. Sets forth new requirements for the application to the Corporation for construction grants. Authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to administrator such grants made before October 1, 1978. Provides for the repayment of such grants if the recipient station ceases to be used for public radio or television purposes. States that such applications must include a five-year plan outlining the applicant's projected facilities requirements and must contain assurance that the planned facilities will be used only for educational or cultural purposes. Title II: Telecommunications Demonstrations - Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1979 to be available to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for disbursement as grants for demonstration projects in the improvement of public telecommunications services. Title III: Corporation for Public Broadcasting - Subjects the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to the requirements of Title VI (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Title IX (prohibition of discrimination in education because of sex or blindness) of the Education Amendments of 1972. Adds to the 15 member Presidentially-appointed board of directors of the Corporation, four members appointed by organizations representing public radio and television licensees. Provides for the reduction of such board by attrition to 15 members, 11 of whom shall be Presidentially-appointed. Terminates the provision for Presidential designation of the chairman of such board. States that the chairman shall be elected from the board membership. Establishes the Public Broadcasting Fund in the Treasury. Authorizes an appropriation of funds to such Fund and provides for annual contributions of public moneys to the Fund based on the amount of non-Federal financial support received by public broadcasting entities. Sets forth regulations governing the use of such Fund."
