Prohibits reducing the frequency of mail delivery service below the frequency which was in effect on April 21, 1977. Prohibits the closing of any post office which provided regular mail service on April 21, 1977, unless written consent is obtained by a majority of the regular patrons of such office who are at least 18 years of age or unless there is a vacancy in the office of the postmaster of such office."
