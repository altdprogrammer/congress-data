Allows a limited credit to lending institutions which finance such purchase, construction, or rehabilitation. Allows individuals a credit for that portion of their State and local property taxes attributable to improvements directly related to rehabilitation expenditures for which the taxpayer is allowed a credit under this title. Title II: Neighborhood Revitalization Designation and Plans - Neighborhood Revitalization Act - Directs units of local government which wish to have the provisions of Title I of this Act apply to an area within their boundaries to designate the area a \"neighborhood revitalization area.\" Requires such a designation to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury if certain requirements are met and a finding is made that the area is declining."
