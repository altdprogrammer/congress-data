Amends ERISA to direct the Secretaries of Labor and the Treasury to jointly prescribe a single form for qualification of employee benefit plans with both the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury. Revises the reporting requirements imposed on employee benefit plans to allow a simplified annual report to be filed four out of every five years. Directs the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor to publish a booklet to assist plan sponsors (particularly small businessmen) in developing or revising recordkeeping systems in order to simplify compliance with ERISA."
