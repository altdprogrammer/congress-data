Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1978 and 1979 to enable the Administrator to conduct a survey of the quantity, quality, and availability of rural drinking water supplies. Specifies that none of the funds authorized under this Act are to be used for research under Title XIV (Safety of Public Water Systems) of the Public Health Service Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to submit a report to Congress analyzing the anticipated cost of compliance with interim and revised national primary drinking water regulations and methods of paying the costs of compliance. Requires the Administrator to submit to Congress a report on the availability of an adequate and dependable supply of safe drinking water to meet present and projected future need. Directs the Administrator to study the effects of specified chemicals and compounds on the safety of drinking water, and means of removing, treating, or otherwise controlling contamination from such substances. Allows the Administrator to extend the date for submission of an application by a State for approval of the State's underground injection control program. Extends through fiscal year 1979 the authority of the Administrator to assure the availability of chemicals needed for water treatment. Makes each Federal agency having jurisdiction over any federally maintained public water system or engaged in any activity which may result in underground injection endangering drinking water, subject to all Federal, State, and local requirements, administrative authorities, and process sanctions respecting safe drinking water. Adds to the definition of \"person\" for purposes of Title XIV (Safety of Public Water Systems), Federal agencies, officers, employees, and agents of any corporation, company, association, State, municipality, or Federal agency. Specifies the rights of citizens, States, and local governments to commence a civil action against any person in violation of Title XIV. Authorizes the Administrator to provide technical assistance and to make grants to States or publicly owned water systems to assist in alleviating emergency situations respecting drinking water which may be anticipated to endanger public health. Authorizes the Administrator to require periodic assessment and evaluation of unregulated contaminants of drinking water which may require continuous monitoring or regulation.
