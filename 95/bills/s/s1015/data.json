    "text": "Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to prohibit the sale, offering for sale, or distribution, of certain detergents containing excessive amounts of phosphorous for use within the Great Lakes Region. Defines the Great Lakes Region to include the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Stipulates that the maximum allowable amounts of phosphorous in such detergents shall not exceed (1) 0.5 percent in the case of machine laundry detergents and household cleanings agents; (2) 11 percent in the case of machine dishwashing detergents; and (3) 20 percent in the case of chemical water conditioners for machine laundry use. Authorizes the Administrator to exempt certain cleaning or water conditioning agents where compliance in deemed unreasonable, impractical, or not feasible. Imposes civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation of the prohibitions contained in this Act. Stipulates that illegal agents or conditioners shall be liable to be proceeded against and condemned in United States district courts. Establishes procedures for condemnation and disposal of such illegal products. Authorizes the Administrator to make inspections within reasonable limits in order to enforce the provisions of this Act. Directs the Administrator to study the feasibility of applying such regulations on a nationwide basis."
