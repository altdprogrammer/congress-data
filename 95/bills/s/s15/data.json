    "text": "Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require each candidate seeking election or nomination to Federal office to file with the Federal Election Commission a declaration: (1) that he intends to make, in connection with his campaign, personal expenditures in excess of, in the aggregate, $35,000, and a statement, under penalty of perjury,(a) of the source of such personal expenditures, (b) of his intention and present ability to spend such funds, and (c) that the purpose of such declaration is not to avoid the contribution limitations imposed under such Act; or (2) that he will not make personal campaign expenditures, in the aggregate, in excess of $35,000. Requires such a declaration to be filed, in the case of primary elections for Federal office, at least 60 days prior to the earlier of the date of the primary election or the date on which a candidate qualifies to have his name placed on the ballot for such primary election. Requires such a declaration to be filed, in elections to Federal office, not later than seven days after the date of any runoff election held for the nomination for election or after the last candidate for a major party (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) qualifies to have his name placed on the ballot. Provides that candidates of minor parties (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) who qualify to have their names placed on the ballot for election after a runoff election or after the last candidate of a major party qualifies, shall file the declaration at the time they so qualify. Grants a limited waiver of the campaign contribution limitations imposed by the Federal Campaign Act if a candidate has filed a declaration that he does not intend to make personal expenditures in his campaign for Federal office in excess of $35,000 and any other candidate for such Federal office has filed a declaration declaring his intent to make personal expenditures in excess of $35,000. Limits such waiver to the contributions received that do not exceed the difference between $35,000 and the greatest amount of intended personal expenditures declared by any candidate for such office. Directs the Commission to transmit to each candidate for Federal office a copy of each declaration of any other candidate for such office and a statement of the greatest amount of intended personal expenditures declared. Requires each candidate intending to make personal expenditures, in the aggregate, in excess of $35,000 to establish a separate checking account for such sums and to hold any funds remaining after the general election or nomination for election in escrow for 60 days. Permits the Commission or any candidate to bring a civil action for the forfeiture of such funds within the 60 day period on the ground that the candidate depositing such funds made a knowingly false statement in his declaration or statement. Places the burden of proof on the candidate against whom such action is brought."
