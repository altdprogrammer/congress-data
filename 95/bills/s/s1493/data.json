    "text": "(Reported jointly to Senate from the Committe on Governmental Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 95-1412) Energy Impact Assistance Act - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 by adding a new Title XI: Energy Impact Assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, on request of the Governor of a State, the governing body of an Indian tribe, or the chief executive of a local government, to designate an area as an energy impact area if there is a major energy development in the area which has created or will create a need for increased public facilities and services, the cost of which cannot be met without Federal assistance. Authorizes the Governor or the governing body of an Indian tribe to establish an energy impact assessment team for such designated area to prepare a mitigation plan identifying the area's needs for increased public services and facilities and presenting proposals for mitigating such needs. Directs the President to coordinate all Federal programs which may provide assistance to meet such needs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and provide other financial and technical assistance for planning and implementation of mitigation plans to eligible applicants and assessment teams. Authorizes the Secretary to provide similar assistance on an expedited basis upon finding a serious threat to public health and safety has resulted from a major energy development in the designated area. Sets forth terms and conditions for financial assistance provided by this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provision of this Act and makes specified allocations of such appropriations. Sets forth criteria for the Secretary for further allocating such funds. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate such regulations as are necessary to carry out this title. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans to eligible applicants and specifies the conditions of such guarantees. Stipulates that financial assistance for implementing mitigation plans shall not be provided unless the State or Indian tribe prepares and submits to the Secretary a comprehensive investment strategy describing the intended use of such assistance. Directs the General Accounting Office to prepare and submit to the Congress, five years after enactment of this Act, a report reviewing the assistance provided under this Act and analyzing its effectiveness."
