Sets priorities for Federal agencies carrying out labor surplus and small business set-aside programs with the highest priority being awarded concerns which are located in labor surplus areas, and which are also small business concerns, on the basis of a total set-aside, and the lowest priority to concerns which are located in labor surplus areas on the basis of a total set-aside."
