    "text": "Consumer Protection Act - Establishes within each Federal agency an Office of Consumer Counsel headed by a Consumer Counsel appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, independent of all other offices of the agency of which such Counsel is a part. States that each Consumer Counsel shall represent the interests of consumers within and before the agency of which his Office is a part and before the courts by intervening in any court action involving such agency when such Counsel determines that such intervention is necessary to protect consumers interests. Permits such Counsel to initiate a civil action on its own behalf or as the representative of an aggrieved consumer. Prohibits the intervention by such Counsel in proceedings before State or local agencies and courts. Requires each Counsel to transmit consumer complaints against his agency to the proper official for appropriate action. Requires such Counsel to maintain a public document file of each such consumer complaint and the action taken with respect to such complaint. Creates, within the Department of Justice, the position of Assistant Attorney General for Consumer Protection, to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to coordinate and assist the Offices of Consumer Counsel. Requires that each Counsel compile and distribute to the public consumer information including: (1) the functions of his Office; (2) consumer products and services; (3) problems encountered by consumers; and (4) notices of consumer-impacting hearings, proposed and final rules and orders, and other activities of the agency of which such Office is a part. Directs each Counsel to conduct and support research concerning the interests of consumers which does not duplicate activities of other agencies. Allows each Counsel to obtain from any Federal agency any information deemed necessary to perform his functions, except specified classified, national security, personal privacy, trade secret, and financial information."
