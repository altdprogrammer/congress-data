    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-808) Authorizes a pilot transportation program to promote activities designed to make the national park system more accessible in a manner consistent with the preservation of parks and the conservation of energy by encouraging the use of transportation modes other than personal motor vehicles for access to units of the national park system with minimum disruption to nearby communities. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to formulate and implement transportation plans for units of the national park system. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) contract with existing transportation services; (2) operate such services directly in the absence of suitable and adequate carriers; (3) acquire capital equipment for such services; and (4) acquire lands or waters outside the boundaries of units of the national park system, where necessary. Requires the Secretary to submit a detailed proposal of such acquisition to the Congress for a 60-day review. Provides that any fees collected in the operation of a transportation service shall be covered into the Planning, Development, and Operation of Recreation Facilities appropriation account. Directs the Secretary to establish information programs to inform the public of available park access opportunities and to promote the use of transportation modes other than personal motor vehicles for access to and travel within the units of the national park system. States that transportation facilities and services provided pursuant to this Act shall not be considered as concession facilities or services within the meaning of the Act of October 9, 1965. Requires the Secretary to consult with the appropriate State and local public service commission prior to implementing a new or modified route. States that the authorities in this Act shall not be deemed an expansion of the exemption of the Interstate Commerce Act which provides that motor vehicles operated under authority of the Secretary for the sole purpose of transporting people in and about the national parks shall be exempt from Interstate Commerce Commission regulations. Directs the heads of appropriate Federal departments or agencies to assist the Secretary in the formulation and implementation of transportation projects. Directs the Secretary to prepare a compilation of Federal statutes and programs providing authority for the planning, funding, or operation of transportation projects which might be utilized by the Secretary in carrying out this Act. Requires that such compilation be submitted to the Congress within 180 days from enactment of this Act. Provides guidelines for: (1) public input during the formulation stage of a transportation plan; and (2) implementation of a transportation plan, including the submission of reports to the Congress on projects in excess of $100,000 in any fiscal year. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress, within three years of the effective date of this Act, containing such information as the preservation of natural resource values and effects of the projects on communities. Authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1979, $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1980, and $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1981."
