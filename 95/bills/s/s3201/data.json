Establishes an identical $500,000,000 limitation for fiscal year 1980, unless one house of Congress agrees to a resolution disapproving such guarantees in 1980. Conditions additional guarantees, limited to $500,000,000 per year, for any fiscal year prior to the beginning of fiscal year 1983, on the presentation to the Secretary of a balanced budget for that year. Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Makes interest income received on any obligation guaranteed under Title I of this Act after the date of the enactment of this title taxable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954."
