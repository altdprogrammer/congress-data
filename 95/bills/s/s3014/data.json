Makes the United States liable for actual and punitive damages resulting from a search or seizure conducted by a Federal investigative or law enforcement officer in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and authorizes the court to award attorney fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs in such actions. Makes an officer who conducted a search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment without a good faith belief in the constitutionality of the search or seizure subject to agency discipline, but renders him immune from a civil suit for damages."
