Amends such Act to change to October 11, 1979 (now October 11, 1978) the date that the President is to submit the final report on the findings on the feasibility of a system to monitor foreign direct investment in rural and urban property and a nationwide land data system. Requires the President to submit an interim report not later than October 11, 1978. Transfers to the President (now the Council on International Economic Policy) the responsibility to review the results of any studies and surveys conducted under such Act."
