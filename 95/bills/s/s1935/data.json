Terminates the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to provide drought relief on November 30, 1977. Increases the number of uses to which funds authorized by law to facilitate emergency actions to mitigate the impacts of the 1976-1977 drought may be put. Removes limitations on the amount which the Secretary may extend to any State water resource agency for drought relief. Authorizes the Secretary to condition grants, or waive all or a portion of the repayment of loans made under this Act, upon the agreement of a recipient to undertake a program of water conservation and efficient management meeting standards established by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on measures which he has undertaken to institute such conservation and management procedures."
