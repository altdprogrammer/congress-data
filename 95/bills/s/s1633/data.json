Gives the consent of the United States to the exercise of criminal and civil jurisdiction by the State of Arizona. Requires, within 30 months from the date of enactment of this Act, the Pascua Yaqui Tribe to adopt a constitution and bylaws or other organized governing documents and membership roll.
