    "text": "Drug Sentencing and Seizure Act - Title I: Sentencing Guidelines - Amends the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 to set forth mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for individuals; (1) manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing specified narcotic drugs, stimulants, or counterfeits thereof; (2) possessing such a substance with intent to distribute or dispense; (3) illegally importing or exporting such a substance; or (4) attempting or conspiring to commit any of the above offenses. Authorizes a court to sentence an individual to a shorter term of imprisonment or parole ineligibility where certain mitigating circumstances are present. Title II: Conditions of Release - Instructs a judicial officer, in setting the conditions of release pending trial, to consider whether a person charged with an offense encompassed by title I of this Act poses a threat to the community or will commit similar offenses. Authorizes a judicial officer to deny pretrial release to a person charged with such an offense upon making any of specified findings in a separate hearing. Title III: Forfeiture of Proceeds of Illegal Drug Transactions - Subjects to forfeiture all proceeds of offenses under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and all moneys, negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended to be used in committing such crimes. Sets forth guidelines for the disposition of property so forfeited."
