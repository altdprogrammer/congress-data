Requires a State conducting such a project: (1) to conduct only one such project on a statewide basis; (2) to provide for safe and reasonable working conditions; (3) to prohibit the displacement of employed workers to accommodate participants in the project; (4) to provide workmen's compensation to all participants; (5) to provide that participation in such project be voluntary. Permits a State to waive requirements under Title IV relating to statewide participation in programs, administration of programs by a single State agency, and disregard of earned income in determining eligibility for benefits under such Title."
