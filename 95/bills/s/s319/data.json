Directs the Corporation to pay one-half of the premium on the insurance purchased by a producer under this Act. Limits, generally, such special insurance to commodities which produce an important part of the total agricultural income of the county. Repeals the $12,000,000 ceiling on the authorized administrative appropriations for the Corporation."
