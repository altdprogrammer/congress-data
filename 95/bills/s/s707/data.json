Stipulates that, before issuance of such certificate, environmental considerations and the need for energy domestically shall be weighed before the Secretary of the Interior makes a finding. Requires that no carrier granted the power of eminent domain under this Act shall transport any coal in which it has any ownership interest. Establishes procedures for making application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, for antitrust review, and for enforcement under this Act. Imposes a maximum fine of $10,000, six months imprisonment, or both, for knowing violations of any provision of, or regulation issued pursuant to, this Act."
