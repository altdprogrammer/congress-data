    "text": "Public Range Lands Improvement Act - Requires that an inventory of rangeland conditions and trends be taken in 11 contiguous western States and Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage and improve public rangelands so that they become as productive as feasible in accordance with the rangeland management objectives established through the land use planning process prescribed in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Provides for the funding of such improvements. Sets forth the formula to be used by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior during the grazing years 1979-1985 in setting fees for domestic livestock grazing on public lands. Requires the allotment of at least $10,000,000 for yearly grazing fees to the range betterment fund. Authorizes the Secretaries to develop an experimental program to use grazing fees and other incentives to reward grazing permittees and lessees for good range stewardship. Requires the Secretaries to report to Congress on the results of such program. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue ten year grazing leases or permits except when he has determined, on a case-by-case basis, that the establishment of a shorter term is in the interest of sound land management policy. Requires the removal, in a humane manner, of excess wild horses and burrows to restore the ecological balance to an area in which rangeland inventories indicate an overpopulation of such animals. Provides for the adoption and donation of such animals to individuals who have provided humane conditions and care for them for a period of one year. Permits the Secretary of the Interior, upon completion of a satisfactory environmental impact statement and consultation with interested parties, to develop an allotment management plan, as defined by this Act. Requires that the plan be tailored to the specific range conditions of the area covered and that such plan be reviewed periodically for its effectiveness and continued feasibility. Limits the authority for entering into cooperative agreements and making payments under this Act to the extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance appropriation Acts. Authorizes the establishment of grazing district advisory boards for national forest lands in South Dakota."
