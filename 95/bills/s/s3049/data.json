    "text": "Product Liability Self-Insurance Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction to any business enterprise engaged in the manufacture, importation, distribution, lease, or sale of any product for contributions to its product liability loss reserve account and for amounts paid to a captive insurer (wholly or partially-owned by the taxpayer) for product liability insurance. Specifies the amount a taxpayer may deduct based upon the ability of such taxpayer to obtain insurance through conventional channels. Disallows any deductions for product liability losses which do not exceed the sum of the total reserve funds in the taxpayer's account at the beginning of the taxable year plus the amount of deductible payment made by the taxpayer to the account during such year. Imposes penalties for the improper use of product liability reserve funds. Treats amounts accumulated in the taxpayer product liability loss reserve account as amounts accumulated for reasonably anticipated business needs, for purposes of avoiding the accumulated earnings tax."
