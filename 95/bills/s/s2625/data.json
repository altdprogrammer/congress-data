    "text": "Competition Improvements Act - Prohibits Federal agencies from taking action which tends to lessen competition except in specified circumstances. Authorizes the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to advise the agencies on the validity of exceptions to this Act. Requires each independent regulatory agency to devise procedures whereby the Attorney General will receive timely and adequate notice of important agency actions which may have a significant impact on competition. Places the burden of proof upon the agency to establish by substantial evidence that it has complied with the standard asserted in this Act in any proceeding for judicial review of such agency's order. Requires Federal departments and agencies to insure the integration of antitrust law and policy in all activities which may have an impact on competition. Requires each Federal department and agency to review its statutory authority, administrative regulations, policies, practices and procedures to determine whether they contain any deficiencies or inconsistencies which may prevent full compliance with the purpose of this Act. Requires the departments and agencies to recommend such measures to the President and to the Congress, as may be necessary, to carry out the purposes of this Act. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to report annually to the President and to Congress on the degree to which Federal agencies have complied with the purposes of this Act."
