Requires the inclusion in gross income overseas cost of living reimbursements made by an employer to an employee for which deductions are allowed under this Act. Allows the deduction by employees of a limited portion of cost of living reimbursements for housing, schooling of dependents and home leave travel. Broadens the definition of what meals and lodging provided by the employer are excludible from the gross income of overseas employees."
