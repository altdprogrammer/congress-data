Rept. 95-1178) Tribal-State Compact Act - =Title I: Authorization of Compacts and Agreements= - Authorizes the States and the Indian tribes to enter into compacts on matters relating to: (1) the enforcement or application of civil, criminal, and regulatory laws of each within their respective jurisdictions; (2) the allocation or determination of governmental responsibility of States and tribes over specified subject matters or specified geographical areas, or both, including compacts providing for concurrent jurisdiction between the States and the Tribes; and (3) transfer of jurisdiction of individual cases from tribal courts to State courts or State courts to tribal courts in accordance with procedures established by the laws of the tribes and States. Allows the United States, upon agreement of the parties and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, to provide 100 percent of the costs for personnel or administrative expenses in any agreement or compact between an Indian tribe and a State under this Act. Sets forth criteria which the Secretary may consider in determining the amount of Federal assistance. Authorizes appropriations not exceeding $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 and such sums as may be necessary thereafter to carry out the compacts entered into in accordance with this title. =Title II: Planning and Monitoring Boards= - Authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to encourage the tribes and the States to establish councils, committees, boards, or task forces between the States and individual tribes, or on a statewide or regional basis, to discuss jurisdictional questions which exist between the parties, and to provide Federal representatives to such discussions from the Department as may be useful. Authorizes appropriations not exceeding $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 and such sums as may be necessary thereafter to carry out the purposes of this title. =Title III: Judicial Enforcement= - Grants to district courts original jurisdiction of civil actions to secure equitable relief brought by parties entered into in accordance with this Act. Stipulates that actions for damages shall only exist as specifically provided for in such agreements."
