    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla, and individual Indians, through purchase or exchange. Permits the Secretary to sell or exchange tribal trust lands and to accept any transfer of title from the Tribes for lands within the boundaries of the reservation. Allows the Secretary to take title to such lands in trust for the Tribes. Makes the interests acquired in such lands nontaxable. Permits the Secretary to purchase lands with tribal funds even though the acquisition would exempt the land from local taxation. States that all land transactions for the Tribes must be upon request of its board of trustees. Requires that money received by the Tribes be used for the purchase of other lands, or for purposes consistent with the Secretary's land consolidation and development program. Authorizes the Secretary to sell or exchange Indian trust lands held in multiple ownership on the Umatilla Reservation to the Tribes, or to an enrolled member of the Tribes. Allows the Tribes, with the Secretary's approval, to execute a mortgage or deed of trust on lands purchased by the Tribes in order to secure the purchase price of the land. Specifies that the laws of Oregon will cover foreclosure and sale under the mortgage, but states that the United States is an indispensable party to any ensuing litigation. States that land acquired by the Tribes at a foreclosure or sale shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the Tribes."
