    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 7010 passed in lieu) Victims of Crime Act - Establishes an Advisory Committee on Victims of Crime to advise the Attorney General with respect to the administration of this Act and the compensation of victims of crime. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified State programs for the compensation of victims of crime. Specifies requirements for program certification, including that the program (1) offer compensation for personal injuries suffered as a result of certain State and Federal crimes, (2) offer compensation to surviving dependents of persons whose deaths resulted from such a crime, (3) grant claimants the right to a hearing, and (4) deny or reduce a claim if the victim or claimant contributed to the death or injury. Prohibits such program from: (1) having a limitation based on the financial means of the victim or any surviving dependent; (2) requiring that any person be apprehended, prosecuted, or convicted of the qualifying crime that gave rise to the claim; and (3) requiring the claimant to seek or accept benefits in the nature of welfare unless such claimant was receiving such benefits prior to the crime giving rise to the claim. Permits States with programs not in compliance with this Act to remain eligible for grants under this Act until the day after the close of the first regular State legislative session that begins after the effective date of this Act. States that grants made under this Act shall total 25 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of State crimes designated by the State as appropriate for compensation under this program and 100 percent of the allowable compensation paid to victims and dependent survivors of victims of crimes which would constitute designated state crimes except for the fact that the crime is subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Limits compensation with respect to any single claim to (1) loss resulting from medical and related treatment, physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation, and past and anticipated future earnings up to $200 per week, (2) claimants, other than a claimant 62 years of age or older whose award would be for an amount more than $100 or for loss of earnings or loss of support computed on the basis of more than five work days, and (3) a total of $50,000. Prohibits Federal funds from being used for: (1) State compensation awards for pain, suffering, or property loss; (2) reimbursing the State for restitution received by the victim or the victim is entitled to receive; (3) claims filed more than one year after the crime; and (4) claims not timely reported to law enforcement authorities or where the claimant fails to cooperate with such authorities. Requires the Attorney General to submit annually a report to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary on each qualifying State program receiving Federal grants pursuant to this Act. Authorizes specified appropriations through fiscal year 1982."
