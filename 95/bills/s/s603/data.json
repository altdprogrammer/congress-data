Authorizes the Secretary to make interest free loans as well as interest-bearing loans to commercial fishermen to alleviate forced economic distress. Authorizes the Secretary to make low-interest loans for experimental fishing equipment, and for the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of certain commercial fishing vessels under five net tons. Specifies that there shall be in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration an Associate Administrator for an Office of Commercial Fisheries Development. Establishes in the Treasury a Commercial Fisheries Development Fund to be used to make loans under this Act. Authorizes the appropriation of sums, not to exceed $200,000,000, to the Fund to provide initial capital for such loans, and sums, not to exceed $1,000,000 for each of the fiscal years ending in 1977, 1978, and 1979 as may be necessary to meet administrative expenses. Amends the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to abolish the loan program for commercial fishing vessels and gear. Transfers certain existing fisheries development programs from the National Marine Fisheries Service to the jurisdiction of the Associate Administrator. Title II: Fisheries Market Promotion and Research Orders - Directs the Secretary to establish a Fisheries Development Board to promote and research markets for fish and fish products especially for underutilized species. Sets forth the procedure for the nomination of Board members. Stipulates that the Board must establish guidelines to determine the fisheries from which fees should be collected, promote markets for fish, enter into contracts for research and promotion projects, and carry out specified administrative functions. Requires the Secretary to authorize the Board to collect certain fees from the first wholesale purchaser of fish landed at dockside to be used for the administrative expenses of the Board. Sets forth a procedure for the refund of such fees to those persons not wishing to support the research and promotion program established by this Act. Directs the Secretary to conduct a comprehensive study regarding the adequacy of existing Federal and State commercial fisheries training programs, as well as a study concerning the marketing, processing, distribution and sale of fish and fish products. Title III: Mandatory Federal Fish and Fish Products Inspection Program - Directs the Secretary to establish a mandatory fish and fish products inspection program. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Title IV: Fisheries Cooperative Service Assistance - Requires the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a pilot program of comprehensive service to assist fishing interests in forming cooperative organizations.
