    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-05-17", 
    "text": "Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to allow the incidental taking of certain marine mammals in commercial fishing, and the issuance of permits therefor subject to specified regulations. Restricts the number of eastern stock spinner dolphin and whitebelly spinner dolphin which may be taken, injured, or pursued during calendar year 1977. Requires that the incidental mortality and service injury of marine mammals be progressively reduced to insignificant levels approaching zero by the establishment of annual quota for affected species. Limits the total incidental mortality and serious injury authorized for calendar year 1980 and thereafter. Sets forth the procedure by which the holder of or a applicant for a permit to take marine mammals may petition for extraordinary relief to increase quota limitations. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to ban the importation of commercial fish and products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental taking or injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards. Authorizes the placement of an authorized Federal agent aboard vessels which the Secretary of the department in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is operating has reasonable cause to believe will engage in the incidental taking of marine mammals. Permits the Secretary to pay the cost of quartering and maintaining such agents. Authorizes the Secretary to place observers aboard foreign commercial fishing vessels to monitor compliance with United States standards. Requires that certain commercial fishing vessels authorized to take marine mammals incidental to commercial tuna fishing be accompanied by authorized agents of the Secretary until December 31, 1978. Directs the Secretary to establish fees for permits to take marine mammals. Requires certain vessels, seeking approval of the Secretary of Commerce with respect to registration as vessels of the United States, or seeking approval to transfer shipping facilities during national emergency, to agree to comply with United States standards for incidental killing and serious injuring of marine mammals. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is operating and the Secretary of State to negotiate with certain foreign governments and within the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission to effect compliance with this Act."
