    "text": "Energy and Weather Emergency Adjustment Assistance Act - Title I: Adjustment Assistance for Workers - Entitles to adjustment assistance allowances of specified amounts each of a group of workers certified by the Administrator of the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration upon a determination that: (1) a significant number or proportion of the workers in the group or subdivision have become totally or partially separated, (2) sales and/or production of such firm have decreased absolutely, and (3) critical shortages of energy supplies or unusually severe weather conditions contributed importantly to such work separation and decline in sales and/or production. Provides additional assistance allowances, including expenses of training programs and seeking new employment, to each of a group of workers qualified for adjustment allowances who are likely to become totally separated on a permanent basis. Title II: Adjustment Assistance to Firms - Entitles firms which are found by the Administrator, due to critical energy shortages or unusual weather conditions, to have ceased sales and/or production and totally or partially separated a significant portion or number of workers to: (1) funds for repairing physical damage resulting from the adverse conditions; and (2) if the firm is a small business and would not otherwise remain competitive, low-interest loans for operating expenses; or (3) if the firm is not a small business, guarantees of loans not otherwise available and necessary to remain competitive. Title III: Adjustment Assistance for Communities - Entitles local governments which are found by the Administrator to have incurred extraordinary expenditures amounting to at least five percent of their operating budget or sustained an increase in unemployment within their jurisdiction of at least ten percent due to critical energy shortages or unusual weather conditions to: (1) funds to reimburse the cost of repairing damaged public facilities and purchasing or renting emergency equipment; and (2) low-interest loans if the adverse conditions result in a substantial revenue loss. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorizes the appropriation for fiscal years 1977 and 1978 of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act. Specifies the effective date of this Act and the duration of the Administrator's authority under it."
