    "text": "Alien Employment Act - Prohibits, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the employment or referral for employment of aliens who have not been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence unless such employment is authorized by the Attorney General. States that any person who violates such provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished for a first offense by a fine not in excess of $1,000 for each alien with respect to whom a violation occurs, and for any subsequent offense such person shall be fined an amount not exceeding $1,000. Prohibits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from assigning to any individual a social security account number unless the Secretary is satisfied that such individual is either a citizen of the United States, or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Assigns duties to the Attorney General pertaining to the enforcement of provisions of this Act. Exempts from the provisions of this Act specified nonimmigrant agricultural labor force personnel lawfully admitted to the United States. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to conduct surveys to insure that individuals employed by employers surveyed have shown their employers a social security card and two pieces of supporting identification. Adds border crossing cards, alien registration receipt cards, and other documents prescribed by regulation for entry into the United States to the list of documents the false making of which shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. Imposes a penalty for counterfeiting or altering social security cards."
