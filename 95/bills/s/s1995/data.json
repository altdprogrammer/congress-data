    "text": "Directs that any alien who is a national of Chile and is not in the United States be issued a nonimmigrant visa and be admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant if the consular officer involved determines that such alien : (1) is being persecuted or is in danger of persecution in Chile on account of his political opinions; (2) is not otherwise excludable from the United States; and (3) has applied for such admission during the one year period following the enactment of this Act. States that admission under this Act shall be for a period of two years during which the aliens shall be allowed to accept employment. Directs the Attorney General to examine the case of the alien before the expiration of the two-year period and to grant permanent resident status to such eligible alien. Directs that any alien who: (1) is a national of Chile; (2) is in the United States on the date of enactment of this Act; and (3) would be persecuted or be in danger of persecution in Chile on account of his political opinions, be placed in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Requires that such alien be inspected and examined for admissions into the United States according to the applicable provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Regards such resident aliens who are found to be admissible after such examination as being lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence as of the date of their arrival. Allows the spouse, child, or parents of a national of Chile who has been admitted to the United States pursuant to this Act to be issued a nonimmigrant visa, admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, and treated as other aliens issued nonimmigrant visas under this Act. Declares that aliens who acquire permanent residence status under this Act shall not be charged against the quota of immigrants allotted to Chile under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Directs the Attorney General to inform any alien who is a national of Chile or the spouse, child, or parent of a national of Chile of the treatment which may be applied for under this Act before such alien is excluded from admission into or deported from the United States."
