    "text": "Amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to permit an individual who: (1) has reached age 60 but has not yet reached age 65; (2) is either entitled to monthly benefits under the old age, survivors, and disability insurance program or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, is the spouse of an individual so entitled, or is entitled to disability benefits or widow's, widower's, mother's, or parent's benefits on the basis of disability; and (3) is presently enrolled under the supplementary medical insurance program of such Title to enroll in the program of hospital insurance benefits for the aged and disabled established under part A of such Title. Permits an individual who meets such age and entitlement requirements, but who is not presently enrolled in the supplementary medical insurance program, to enroll in such program. Provides that individuals enrolling in the hospital insurance benefit program under this Act pay, during the first year of enrollment, the same monthly premium as present enrollees and that individuals likewise enrolling under the supplementary medical insurance program pay 300 percent of the premium now paid by present enrollees. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to recompute such premium, after the first year of enrollment, to reflect the actual cost of providing medical care to the individuals, as a group, enrolling under the provisions of this Act."
