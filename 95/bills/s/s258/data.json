Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate camp safety regulations within nine months of enactment of this Act. Provides that during a two-year period following promulgation and annually thereafter States may assume responsibility for development and enforcement of safety standards. Requires such States to submit plans for such development and enforcement. Grants the Secretary a right of disapproval of such plans. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance and consultative services to assist in the development and implementation of State plans. Permits the Secretary to make grants to States for the development of youth camp safety plans, to assist such States with plan initiation and training costs, and for the early operation and improvement of youth camp safety programs. Permits representatives of the Secretary to inspect youth camps and to investigate their records. Requires youth camp operators to file annual reports with the Secretary on accidents resulting in death, injury, and serious illness. Requires the Secretary to provide for the citation of youth camp operators for any violation of any standard, rule, or order promulgated pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to afford an opportunity for a hearing for any youth camp operator issued a citation or notice of a proposed penalty. Permits any youth camp operator adversely affected by the decision of the hearing examiner to obtain a review of the decision in the United States court of appeals. Provides that upon the request of any youth camp operator, director, or staff, or during any inspection the Secretary shall provide consultative services to youth camps in States which do not have in effect a State plan. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act and regulations by youth camp operators. Grants United States district courts and other courts of competent jurisdiction the jurisdiction, upon petition of the State or Secretary as appropriate, to restrain youth camp conditions threatening imminent dangers. Directs the Secretary to establish an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety to advise and consult on policy matters relating to youth camp safety.
