    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Domestic Volunteer Service Act Amendments - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to authorize the Director of ACTION to make advance payments of a volunteer's end-of-service stipend during the volunteer's period of service. Repeals the limitation on appropriated funds that may be used to support volunteers or to encourage students in secondary and post-secondary schools to participate in service-learning programs. Authorizes the Director to provide stipends and other support payments to any ACTION volunteer who has volunteered for at least ten weeks of service or at least 20 hours of service per week. Declares that Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) volunteers shall not be deemed to be Federal employees for any purpose. Repeals the right of specified State or community action agencies to supervise or carry out Foster Grandparent or Older American Community Service programs and substitutes the right of such agencies to review appropriate project applications and to make recommendations on such applications. Declares full- and part-time antipoverty volunteers who have served less than one year, as well as other already so declared under present law, to be Federal employees for purposes of the Hatch Act, Internal Revenue Code, Social Security Act, Federal Tort Claims Act, and provisions dealing with injuries incurred during service as a Federal employee. Makes the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for persons who are damaged as a result of the malpractice of a full-time ACTION volunteer providing medical care or treatment within the scope of such volunteer's duties. Prohibits the denial of governmental assistance to a full-time volunteer if such volunteer would otherwise be entitled to such assistance if the reason for such denial is such volunteer's refusal to register for, seek, or accept employment. Makes the nondiscrimination provisions of the Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applicable to entities receiving ACTION volunteer help. Prohibits discrimination by any ACTION agency against any volunteer enrolled for at least 20 hours per week of service on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."
