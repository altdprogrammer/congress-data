Requires the Council to evaluate the economic effects of Federal activities such as spending and facility relocations and to identify those geographic areas which are economically affected in a substantial way by such activities. Directs the Council to prepare an economic impact statement for each such activity and makes such statement available to Congress and the public. Requires Federal agencies to make such changes in such activities as are necessary to avoid intensifying any negative economic trends in those communities identified by the Council as substantially affected economically. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make employment training programs available to persons in such substantially affected areas. Directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Defense to make technical and economic adjustment assistance available to such areas."
