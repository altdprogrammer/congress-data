    "text": "Energy Planning Act - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to require the President to transmit to the Congress the proposed National Energy Policy Plan not later than April 1, 1981 (presently April 1, 1979) and every four years thereafter (presently biennially thereafter). Requires such plan to establish energy objectives for periods of 25 and 50 years (in addition to the present five and ten year period objectives). Amends such Act to require the President to insure that energy producers, processors, and distributors are consulted in the development of the plan. Amends the Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to provide that the time intervals for achieving short-term, middle-term, and long-term energy and environmental solutions under the comprehensive plan for energy research and development of such Act be based on the approval date of any National Energy Policy Plan."
