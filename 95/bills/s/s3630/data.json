Requires the imposition of an additional tax (negative credit) upon firms which increase wages in excess of the target rate. Specifies the allowable amount of the counterinflation credit and the negative credit. Imposes an additional tax upon the profits of a firm, if such profits represent an increase in taxable income which is greater than the average rate of increase in wages paid by the firm for the taxable year."
