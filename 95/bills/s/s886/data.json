    "text": "Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 to establish a 200-mile marine pollution control zone to which the provisions of such Act shall apply. Stipulates that such zone shall be reduced to a line equidistant between the United States and a foreign nation where such line of equidistance between the two countries is less than 200 miles. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish standards of performance for all vessels in order to protect the waters of the United States and the marine pollution control zone. Authorizes the Administrator to request the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to review vessel design standards if inadequate to meet such standards of performance. Directs the Secretary to review standards applicable to United States-flag vessels engaged in coastwise trade. Authorizes the imposition of stricter standards by the Secretary and the Administrator with respect to such vessels as compared to those standards applicable to other vessels."
