    "text": "Farmer Survival Act - Title I: National Production Goals - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to proclaim a national production quota for those commodities (other than tobacco) designated by the National Agricultural Producers Board. Requires each such quota to be a quantity sufficient to meet domestic consumption and export requirements for the next marketing year, plus any quantity needed for a national strategic reserve. Title II: National Agricultural Producers Board - Establishes the National Agricultural Producers Board, whose duty, in part, shall be to determine which agricultural commodities shall be included in the national production quota and marketing certificate program. Title III: Marketing Certificates - Requires the Secretary to issue a marketing certificate to each producer of any commodity prescribing the maximum quantity of such commodity to be marketed in the marketing year. Specifies a formula for the determination of such quantity. Title IV: Pricing Policy - Prohibits the sale or disposition of any commodity at a price less than the market price announced by the Secretary. Requires such price to be the average parity price for a commodity for the preceding marketing year as determined by the Secretary of the Board. Title V: Reserves - Authorizes the Secretary to establish a national strategic reserve of any commodity, sales from which shall be permitted to make up for under-production. Requires sales at not less than full parity prices. Title VI: Applicability of Other Laws - Declares other laws inapplicable to any commodity to the extent such laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. Title VII: Impact Assessment - Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the extent to which increased food prices resulting from provisions of this Act can be expected to affect adversely the ability of lower income Americans to attain nutritionally adequate diets at reasonable costs. Requires recommendations concerning methods of financial assistance to such Americans. Title VIII: Sanctions - Prescribes criminal penalties for the sale or disposition of any agricultural commodity in violation of this Act or any regulation issued pursuant to it."
