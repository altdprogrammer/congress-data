    "text": "Child Health Assessment Act - Amends Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require State plans for the administration of such Title to include a provision for the early periodic screening of physical and mental defects in children under the age of six who are members of families eligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Establishes a Child Health Assessment Program under Medicaid. Requires State Medicaid plans to include the provision of child health assessments and primary care to specified individuals under the age of 21. Directs that child health assessments be provided only by a health care provider who enters into an agreement with the State agency responsible for the administration of the Medicaid plan to: (1) provide to specified individuals periodic health assessments; (2) provide a minimum range of diagnostic and treatment services; (3) be readily accessible on an ongoing basis; and (4) make required reports to the State to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Allows an individual who has received a health assessment to remain eligible for all care and services provided under the State plan for six months after such individual's family has become ineligible for Medicaid or Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Requires State medicaid plans to provide that the State will encourage participation by physicians and health care centers in the child assessment program and that the State will assure the physicians and health care centers of the availability of appropriate support services. Provides for the funding of the program out of the sums appropriated for State medicaid programs. Allows the Secretary to reduce, by 20 percent, a State's Medicaid funds if the State does not comply with standards promulgated for the Child Health Assessment Program. Allows the Secretary to make additional payments to States that have met the criteria for good performance of the State's Child Health Assessment Program. Sets forth the criteria for determining good performance under such program. Repeals previous provision of the Social Security Act relating to appropriations for Child Health Care Assessment programs."
