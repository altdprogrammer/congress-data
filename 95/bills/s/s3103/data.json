Adds the following new title to the Public Health Service Act, Title XVIII - International Health. Directs the President to establish an Intra-Governmental Coordinating Committee on International Health. Requires the Committee to identify and coordinate all international health activities by any entity of the Federal Government. Establishes within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare an Office of International Health. Requires the Office to be responsible for the identification and coordination of all training, service, and research activities in international health within the Department. Sets forth such activities. Establishes within the Office of International Health a center to be known as the Fogarty International Center for Health Training and Research. Requires the Fogarty Center to be responsible for: (1) the development and coordination of international health manpower training and research programs within the Department; and (2) the development and operation of specified international health manpower development and institutional support programs. Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide for an initiative within the Department.
