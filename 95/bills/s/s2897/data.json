    "text": "Railroad Safety Act Amendments - Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to stipulate that a State may bring suit to enforce railroad safety rules, regulations, or orders where the Secretary of Transportation has failed to act within 90 days after being notified of the violation by the investigating State agency (previously a State could commence an action where the Secretary failed to act within 90 days after the violation occurred). Removes the authority of the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate rail accidents. Authorizes appropriations in specified amounts to carry out the provisions of such Act for fiscal years 1979 and 1980. Amends the Hours of Service Act to restricts its application to common carriers by railroad engaging in interstate or foreign commerce. Vests the authority to assess civil penalties for improperly equipped railroad cars and locomotives with the Secretary of Transportation."
