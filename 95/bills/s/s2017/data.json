    "text": "Freedom of Choice in Education Act - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to define \"unitary school system\" for purposes of such Act. Calls for a jury decision as to whether a school system needs such definition. Provides for the termination of United States district and appeals court desegregation orders regarding systems meeting such definition Prohibits such courts from assuming jurisdiction or issuing orders regarding (1) student assignment; (2) administrative and teaching staff; (3) funds; and (4) accreditation of systems meeting such definition. Prohibits withholding Federal funds from such systems. Establishes a similar procedure with parallel restrictions on Federal courts in cases involving statewide postsecondary education systems."
