    "text": "Amends the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act to direct the Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, and Navy to require the Administrator of General Services to establish a program (1) to provide for the acquisition of strategic and critical materials from foreign countries through the barter of goods owned by the United States, and (2) to insure the active cooperation and participation of each appropriate department and agency having custody of goods suitable for barter. Requires the annual stock piling report submitted to the Congress by such Secretaries to include a report regarding such barter program. Prohibits the appropriation or obligation of funds under such Act for the procurement of strategic or critical materials unless funds for such procurement have been specifically authorized by law. Makes excess materials in the inventory maintained under the Defense Production Act and in the national and supplemental stockpiles available, where authorized, for transfer at fair market value as payment for expenses in the acquiring, refining, and rotating of materials pursuant to such barter program. Establishes within the Treasury a Strategic and Critical Materials Procurement Fund. Stipulates that all moneys received from the sales of materials under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act shall be placed into the Fund and that moneys from such fund shall be available only, when appropriated, for the procurement, transportation, maintenance, rotation, storage, refining or processing of materials under such Act. Requires the Administrator of General Services to annually report to Congress on the operation of the Fund."
