Requires semiannual adjustments but authorizes quarterly adjustments when there are sharp increases in the index of prices paid by farmers. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a sell-back price at a level high enough to encourage holding of stocks by the private sector rather than the Commodity Credit Corporation."
