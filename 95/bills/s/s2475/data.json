    "text": "Public Grazing Lands Improvement Act - Requires that an inventory of rangeland conditions and trends be taken in 11 contiguous western states and Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage and improve public rangelands so that they become as productive as feasible in accordance with the rangeland management objectives established through the land use planning process prescribed in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Provides for the funding of such improvements. Announces the formula to be used by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior in setting fees for domestic livestock grazing on public lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue ten-year grazing leases or permits except when he has determined, on a case-by-case basis, that the establishment of a shorter term is in the interest of sound land management policy. Allows for private adoption of excess wild horses or burros when rangeland inventories indicate overpopulation of such animals in an area where a demand for private adoption exists. Permits the donation of adopted burros and horses to individuals who have provided humane conditions and care for such animals for a period of one year."
