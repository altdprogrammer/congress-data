Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to require that foreign-flag vessels carrying combustible liquid cargo in bulk within such zone or within the navigable waters of the United States have on board at least two mates and one engineer who are citizens of the United States and licensed under United States laws and that one such individual be on watch while the vessel is so operating. Authorizes the Secretary to grant exemptions to such requirement under specified circumstances. Makes requirements pertaining to vessels carrying inflammable or combustible liquid bulk cargo within the navigable waters of the U.S. applicable to the fishery conservation zone."
