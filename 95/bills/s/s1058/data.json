Declares that the statistical classification of farms in effect on June 30, 1976, shall be effective for purposes of the 1974 census. Declares that the statistical classification of farms effective for the 1979 census and thereafter shall not exclude any establishment which has sold or would normally sell more than $250 (adjusted by a certain percentage) of agricultural products during the census year. Directs the Department to improve the collection, analysis, and publication of data about the ownership structure of farms in the United States."
