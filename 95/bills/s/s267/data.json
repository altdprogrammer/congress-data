Makes it unlawful for any commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator who is or should be registered under this Act to defraud any client or participant. Prohibits any person from offering to enter into or entering into any transaction for the delivery of silver bullion, gold bullion, or bulk silver coins or bulk gold coins, pursuant to a standardized contract contrary to any rules, regulations or orders of the Commission designed to insure the financial solvency of the transaction or prevent manipulation or fraud."
