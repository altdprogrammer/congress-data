Limits the credit taken to $80,000. Reduces the allowable credit to 35 percent for certain new employees numbering more than five. Limits the number of employees for whom credit may be taken to ten new employees, or the maximum number of employees paid by the taxpayer during the calendar quarter ending the previous June 30th, whichever number is less. Directs the Secretary to submit reports to Congress in 1978 and 1980 assessing the impact of this credit."
