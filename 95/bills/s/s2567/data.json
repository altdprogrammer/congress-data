Requires each State health authority which submits an application for a grant to assist in providing comprehensive public health services to have in effect a method satisfactory to the Secretary which will assure equitable distribution of funds among the communities of the State which have made expenditures for comprehensive public health services. Sets forth a method for computing the amount of grant funds which shall be distributed to those local public health entities which have spent funds during the fiscal year for comprehensive public health services. Establishes minimum and maximum limits for such payments to each local public health entity. Sets forth a method of computing the amount of funds a State public health authority shall receive. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for grants made pursuant to this Act. Directs the Secretary to consult with a conference of State health authorities before promulgating regulations made pursuant to this Act."
