Requires that the Secretary develop and publish guidelines for State management plans and projects within six months of the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer personnel, equipment, and scientific information to carry out this Act. Sets forth the formula for the apportionment of revenue to the States and limitations upon administrative expenses of the Secretary and the States chargeable to the Nongame Fish and Wildlife Conservation Fund. Permits any amount apportioned to a State but not expended or obligated after two fiscal years to be used by the Secretary to assist such programs in other States. Permits any such amount not paid or obligated by the Secretary at the end of two fiscal years to be made available for any nongame fish and wildlife resource project of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Directs all Federal departments and agencies to coordinate their programs with nongame fish and wildlife conservation projects administered by the States. Directs each Federal department and agency with management authority over land and water resources or interests therein (1) to determine which programs under its authority may be extended to include conservation of nongame fish and wildlife species, (2) to notify the appropriate State agency of any such affirmative determination, and (3) to cooperate with the establishment of conservation agreements with State agencies for such efforts. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1979, 1980, and 1981 to carry out this Act."
