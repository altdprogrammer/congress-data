Stipulates that grants made pursuant to this Act shall serve as an incentive to States to implement and execute such strategies, and shall not be used by States to reduce existing levels of State assistance to distressed or declining communities. States that an application for a grant under this Act shall: (1) set forth a comprehensive State community conservation and development strategy; and (2) describe the process used for involving the legislature, the State's communities, and organizations of elected officials in the development of such strategy, and include other specified information. Directs the Secretary to establish the criteria to be used in the evaluation of and the awarding of grants for State community conservation and development strategies. Requires that communities be afforded an opportunity to object to any proposed plans before approval is granted by the Secretary."
