Defines \"subterminal facility\" as any facility used for the transient storage of bulk agricultural commodities or for transporting, upgrading, receiving, drying, or loading them out. Requires such facilities to be located between an area of agricultural production and any major storage or major export point, at a place that conveniently serves the needs of producers and purchasers of such commodities, including rail sidings, and loading or unloading facilities which can accommodate unit railroad cars and other appropriate transportation modes designed for the transport and storage of bulk agricultural commodities. Prescribes the necessary contents of the grain shipment and storage plans required from applicant States."
