Extends the coverage of such Act (1) 120 days after enactment of this Act to persons 66; (2) one year after that to persons 68; and (3) two years after that to persons 70. Directs the Secretary of Labor to undertake a study, directly or by contract, of the effects of raising the upper age limitation under this Act. Directs that such study focus upon (1) the effect of raising the limitation to 70; (2) the feasibility of raising the limit above 70; and (3) the feasibility of lowering the minimum age for coverage under such Act. Directs that such study be completed within one year after the limitation of 70 becomes effective, and the results of such study be reported to the Congress."
