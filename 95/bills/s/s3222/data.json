Permits issuance of a search warrant instead of a subpena duces tecum only if there is: (1) probable cause to believe the person in possession, custody, or control of the evidence to be seized has committed or is committing a criminal offense; or (2) reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice pursuant to a subpena duces tecum would lead to the destruction, concealment, or alteration of such evidence. Prescribes a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year for the violation of this Act."
