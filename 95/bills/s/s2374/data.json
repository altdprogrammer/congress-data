    "text": "Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to establish expedited procedures for the determination of matters involving carriers other than rail carriers before the Interstate Commerce Commission. Permits the Commission or a division to void the requirement that an initial decision be made on such matters where questions of policy, new or novel issues of law, or issues of general transportation policy are involved. Establishes review procedures for initial decisions made by a division, an individual Commissioner or an authorized employee. Stipulates that such an initial decision shall be deemed an action of the Commission on the twentieth day after it is served on the interested parties unless it is appealed during such period or by the end of an extended period as authorized or is stayed by the Commission, an individual Commissioner, division, or employee or appeal board. Authorizes the Commission to establish regulations to permit appeal boards to review specified types of initial decisions and issue administratively final decisions in specified situations. Stipulates that review after the appeal of an initial decision has been determined may only be granted on a clear showing that material new evidence, changed circumstances or matters of general transportation importance are involved. Authorizes the Commission to change final decisions where warranted because of material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances. Stipulates that actions of the Commission shall become effective on the thirtieth day of service of such action upon the interested parties unless the Commission provides otherwise. Defines final actions by the Commission for purposes of judicial review."
