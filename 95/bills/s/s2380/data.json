R. 188) Amends the Intervention on the High Seas Act to enable the United States to take necessary action on the high seas, in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, and protocol, to prevent, mitigate, or eliminate the pollution of the Sea by convention oil or of the sea or atmosphere by a substance other then convention oil, by a foreign flag or United States vessel. Permits the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Commerce, to determine additional substances, other than those enumerated in the protocol, which are liable to create a hazard to human health, to harm living resources, to damage amenities, or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea. Requires the United States, in adherence to the protocol, when taking intervention action for an unlisted substance, to establish that at the time of intervention the substance could reasonable pose a grave and imminent danger analogous to that posed by a substance listed in the protocol. Authorizes the Secretary to propose, and the President to accept, amendments to the list of substances other than convention oil in accordance with article III of the protocol."
