Precludes deserters and most persons discharged because of an unauthorized absence of more than 180 days from receiving benefits as a result of a board of review determination. States that the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs should not promulgate any new or revised regulations providing any unique or special advantage to veterans who have received upgraded discharges under revised standards, or otherwise make any special distinction between such veterans and other veterans.
