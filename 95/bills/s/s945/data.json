    "text": "Recombinant DNA Standard Act - Title I: Regulations Governing the Conduct and Development of Recombinant DNA Research - Requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate regulations applicable to recombinant DNA research. Makes such regulations applicable to all such research which is in or affects commerce, or which is carried on in any area subject to United States jurisdiction. Authorizes agents designated by the Secretary to enforce this Act to enter and inspect facilities engaged in recombinant DNA research. Requires the Attorney General, at the Secretary's request, to bring suit in United States District Court to enjoin the continuation of research involving recombinant DNA which constitutes a significant hazard to the public health. Grants any individual standing to sue for injunctive relief under this Act if such person has reason to believe that such research constitutes a significant hazard to the public health. Entitles persons bringing civil actions under this Act to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, fees and costs of experts, and litigation expenses. Establishes criminal penalties for violation of this Act. Title II: Study of Recombinant DNA Research and Technology - Establishes a National Commission for the Study of Recombinant DNA Research and Technology to: (1) conduct a study on the appropriations of continuing such research; (2) identify the ethical and scientific principles which should underlie such research; (3) develop guidelines for DNA research; (4) make recommendations to the Secretary for administrative action with respect to the application of such guidelines and principles. Requires the Commission to undertake a comprehensive study of the ethical, social, and legal implications of advances in recombinant DNA research and technology. Sets for the administrative procedure to be followed by the Secretary with respect to recommendations of the Commission."
