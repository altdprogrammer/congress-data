States that such employee may appeal any adverse personnel action taken against him or her in violation of this Act to the Civil Service Commission. Requires the appropriate administrative authority to take such action as the Commission recommends. States that the representative of an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, or the Federal Bureau of Investigation must be an employee of the same agency as the employee and must be approved by that agency for access to the information involved in the investigation. States that for employees of such agencies any appeal shall be only to the President. (Adds 5 U.S.C. 7171, 7172, 7173)"
