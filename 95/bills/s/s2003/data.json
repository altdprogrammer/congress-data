Requires the President, upon request, to furnish relevant information to Congressional committees with monetary policy oversight responsibilities. Amends the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 to prohibit the extension of any Fund loan by more than six months unless the President notifies Congress that exigent circumstances exist. Terminates the requirement that United States obligations be payable in dollars rather than gold."
