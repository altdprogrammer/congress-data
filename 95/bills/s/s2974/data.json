Title II: Establishment of a National Historic Trails Category within the National Trails System - Amends the National Trails System Act to include historic trails, in addition to recreation and scenic trails, within the National Trails System. Defines historic trails as those trails which follow as closely as possible and practicable the original trails or routes of travel of national historical significance. Sets qualifications for designation as a National Historic Trail, including, establishment through historic use, national significance with respect to any of several broad facets of American history, and potential for public recreational use related to historic appreciation. Requires the Secretary charged with the administration of each trail to establish an advisory council for each such trail within one year of the date of addition of any national scenic or historic trail to the System. Requires, within two years, submission to Congress of a comprehensive acquisition, management, and development plan for each such trail. Title III: Designation of Certain Routes as National Historic Trails - Designates Oregon Trail, the Mormon Pioneer Trail, the Lewis and Clark Trail, and the Iditarod Trail, Alaska, as National Historic Trails. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
