    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Supplemental Housing Authorization Act - =Title I: Supplemental Authorizations and Extensions of HUD Programs= - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to extend the fiscal year 1976 limitations on aggregate annual contractual contributions for low-income housing projects from $850,000,000 to $1,228,050,000 and for the operation of such projects from $576,000,000 to $595,600,000. Extends to 360 months the term for which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may contract to make low-income housing assistance payments. Reinstates the ceiling for losses incurred by the Federal Housing Administration's general insurance fund and raises such ceiling from its previous level of $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000. Makes supplemental authorizations reimbursing housing loan funds for properties transferred under the Urban Homesteading Demonstration program under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Extends until April 30, 1978 the National Insurance Development Program under the National Housing Act. Deletes the \"workable program\" requirement for the purpose of securing mortgage insurance under the National Housing Act. Encourages the construction of moderate income housing by making limited dividend sponsors eligible for mortgages under such Act. =Title II: National Commission on Neighborhoods= - National Neighborhood Policy Act - Establishes a National Commission on Neighborhoods composed of 20 members appointed by Congress and the President. Directs the Commission: (1) to study the factors contributing to the decline of city neighborhoods and the factors necessary for neighborhood survival and revitalization; (2) to make recommendations for modifications in Federal, State and local laws, policies and programs necessary to facilitate neighborhood preservation and revitalization; and (3) to report to Congress and to the President on such study. Enumerates the powers of the Commission including the powers: (1) to award contracts and grants to evaluate existing neighborhood revitalization programs and the impact of existing laws on neighborhoods; and (2) to hold hearings in neighborhoods for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act. Expresses the congressional finding that severe localized economic distress caused by the legal claims of the Mashpee Tribe in Massachusetts may require the furnishing of assistance under the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Act to avoid mortgage foreclosures and distress sales resulting from temporary unemployment."
