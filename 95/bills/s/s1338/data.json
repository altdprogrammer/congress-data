    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 95-324) Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue permits to allow any person to use areas within forest reserves of the national forest system to provide commercial outdoor recreation facilities and services. Sets limitations on the amount of land that may be used for recreation facilities and ski area facilities. Sets requirements for the issuance of permits for ski area facilities. Requires the Secretary to publish criteria and procedures which must be followed prior to issuance of a permit. Requires the permittee to pay an annual fee to the United States for the use of such forest reserve lands. Directs the Secretary to pay half of all such moneys received to the unit or units of local government located within the boundaries of such reserve lands. Requires the Secretary to publish regulations governing a permittee's request to increase charges to the public and to make available for public inspection financial information about the permittee or prospective permittee before such charges are increased or permit is issued. Requires the Secretary to conduct a study concerning the public acceptability, and possibility of alternative low-cost ski facilities. Requires periodic studies to be conducted on the overview of demands for and supply of outdoor recreation facilities, the competition among suppliers of such facilities and services, and whether such facilities and services are offered on an equitable basis. Sets forth rules governing ownership and removal of improvements on such reserve land."
