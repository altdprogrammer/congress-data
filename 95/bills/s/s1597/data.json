Allows the Secretary to: (1) authorize the affixation of a safety approval plate to any container which, after examination, is not found to have a safety approval plate attached to it and which the owner has established meets the standards of the Convention; (2) delegate and withdraw the delegation of authority to initially approve existing and new containers and designs for new containers, and to authorize the affixing of a safety approval plate; and (3) establish a schedule of fees to be charged and collected for services related to the testing inspection, end initial approval of containers and container designs. Permits the Secretary to take action to ensure compliance with the Act.

Authorizes the Secretary to issue detention or other necessary orders for containers not having valid safety approval plates. Establishes civil penalties for moving containers in violation of a detention order. Prohibits discrimination against employees who have reported the existence of an unsafe container or who have reported violations of this Act.
