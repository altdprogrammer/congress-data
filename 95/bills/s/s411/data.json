Lists acceptable approaches for achieving such objective. Amends the Housing Act of 1964 to require the designation of concentrated revitalization areas in which 90 percent of rehabilitation loan funds must be allocated. Replaces the three percent interest rate on such loans with a sliding scale interest rate between three and seven percent. Limits such loans to homeowners with incomes of less than $20,000."
