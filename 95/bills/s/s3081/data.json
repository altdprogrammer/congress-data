Defines \"designated terminal\" under such Act. Removes the authority of the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate rail accidents. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct an evaluation of the safety and efficiency of rail transportation from which rules, regulations, orders and standards relating to maximum size, weight, and length of railroad cars and trains issued by the Secretary shall be derived. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress within two years after the date of enactment of this Act the results of a study on the effect of the exclusive ownership and control of rights-of-way by railroads on the safety and efficiency of rail transportation."
