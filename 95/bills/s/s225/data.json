Permits any aggrieved party to seek to enjoin or obtain other appropriate remedy when a charter revocation or suspension or an involuntary liquidation is ordered by the Board. Limits the powers of the Administration to the exercise of all powers specifically granted by the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act and such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry out the power so granted. Title III: Share Insurance - Includes credit unions organized and operated according to the law of the trust territories in the Federal Credit union whose member accounts are insured by the Administrator.
