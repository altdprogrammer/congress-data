    "text": "Requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, to reopen, for a special period ending 30 days after the normal closing date, any county which for any reason the Corporation has closed to new applications for crop insurance prior to the normal closing date, upon a determination by Secretary of Agriculture that an emergency exists in such county as a result of a natural disaster. Stipulates that terms, conditions, and premium rates shall be the same as those applicable to similarly situated eligible applicants prior to the most recent closing period for the crop to be insured. Directs the Treasury of the United States to reimburse the Corporation for such insurance issued. States that future adjustments in premium rates are not to take into account actuarial data arising from insurance issued during this reopening period. Applies the terms of this Act to the 1977 crop year only."
