    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate (inserted text of S. 2441), H.R. 11733 passed in lieu) Federal-Aid Highway Act - Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to decrease authorizations for the Interstate Highway System for fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Prohibits the use of interstate construction funds apportioned to a State to expand or clear areas adjacent to Interstate routes designed prior to February, 1967. Specifies the method by which the Secretary of Transportation is to apportion interstate highway funds for fiscal year 1980. Authorizes appropriations for various highway programs for fiscal years 1979 and 1980. Establishes a minimum apportionment for each of the States at one-half of one percent of the total apportionment for the Interstate System. Authorizes appropriations for the resurfacing of lanes on the Interstate System which have been in use for more than five years. Stipulates that the Federal share of such a project shall not exceed 70 percent of its cost. Declares the national policy that Highway Trust Fund annual authorizations be closely related to anticipated annual receipts of the Fund. Declares that certain principles are to be taken into account when providing for growth. Repeals certain limitations on the Secretary's authority to designate withdrawn mileage to other interstate routes. Increases the Federal matching share for any State transit or highway project which is substituted for an Interstate System project. Eliminates the requirement that a State must apply sums received for withdrawn projects to a permissible transportation project in order to be exempt from refunding such sums to the Fund. Prohibits the Secretary from redesignating any State withdrawn mileage from the Interstate System as an Interstate project. Provides that States will not be required to refund to the Fund, upon withdrawal of routes, sums received by the State for certain costs. Limits the Federal-aid urban highway system to areas having a population of 50,000 or more. Prohibits the Secretary from approving a withdrawal of Interstate mileage and transfer of funds to public transportation or other highway purposes after September 30, 1982. Stipulates that after such date the Secretary may not approve any Interstate project unless the environmental impact statement has been completed. Requires all Interstate projects and substitute projects to be under construction by September 30, 1986, or be removed from Interstate designation. Revises the Interstate System apportionment formula to give added weight to the cost to complete essential gaps in the System and to improve certain substandard routes in urbanized areas. Permits States to allocate up to five percent of their total allocation for projects to restore or rehabilitate Interstate highways that have been in use for more than five years. Revises the Interstate System resurfacing apportionment. Revises the population factor in the apportionment formula for secondary highway systems to include areas with a population of between 5,000 and 50,000. Authorizes a State to transfer up to 50 percent of its primary, urban or secondary highway program apportionment from one of these programs to another. Stipulates that urban system funds allocated to areas of 200,000 or more may not be transferred without the approval of local officials. Authorizes States which have obligated all of their present Interstate apportionments to obligate advances against their next annual apportionment. Directs the Secretary in making such advances to give priority to applications involving a completion of essential gaps in the System. Requires the Secretary to insure that the States commit adequate resources to the maintenance of Interstate routes. Requires that such a program contain minimum standards by which the condition of Interstate routes shall be judged and that Interstate routes which are more than five years old be inspected annually. Directs the Secretary to withhold approval of a State's primary system projects if deficiencies were found in an Interstate route and the State had not made adequate commitments to repair such deficiencies within a year. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress by October 1, 1980, regarding such maintenance program. Reduces the time period during which States may use their Interstate apportionments. Stipulates that at the end of such period the Secretary may allocate such sums to States with ready-to-commence Interstate projects. Requires that preference be given in such allocation to projects to complete essential gaps in the System. Authorizes States to use Interstate Funds to pay both principal and interest on bonds issued after the enactment of this Act for Interstate construction under certain circumstances (previously such funds could only be used for the payment of the principal on such bonds). Stipulates that Federal financial assistance for emergency repairs and reconstruction of roads on the Federal-aid system shall be entirely funded from the Highway Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary to undertake a study of the costs of highway construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance attributable to various classes of highway users and to the environment. Directs the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate the distribution of tax burdens among highway users and to report its findings to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress by January 15, 1982, the results of such study and to recommend alternative tax structures which will more equitably allocate highway costs among highway users. Directs the Secretary to investigate the need for uniform maximum truck sizes and weights throughout the country including an evaluation of the economic effects of reducing vehicle weight limits in States with legal limits higher than the national maximum.

Allows the use of electronic signs to provide public service information or advertise activities on the premises along Interstate highways. Authorizes the Secretary to approve the use of secondary highway system funds by a State for public transportation projects. Repeals the prohibition against such approval when there is assured funding for both highway and public transportation. Expands the special bridge replacement program to authorize the use of such funds for highway bridge rehabilitation projects. Authorizes a State to use between 15 and 25 percent of such funds to repair or replace highway bridges which are not on any Federal-aid system.

Requires States to distribute funds to urbanized areas of less than 200,000 population on a fair and equitable basis. Directs the Secretary to establish a highway safety improvement program for projects on any public road or street in urban or rural areas. Directs each State to develop a highway safety improvement program. Requires States to use at least 30 percent of its highway safety apportionment for projects not on a Federal-aid system. Requires States to submit specified data regarding the percentage of vehicles exceeding the 55 mile per hour national maximum speed limit. Reduces Federal-aid highway funds to States which fail to achieve a specified level of compliance with such limit.
