    "text": "National Gas and Petroleum Conservation and Coal Utilization Act - Amends the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to extend the authority of the Federal Energy Administrator to issue coal conversion orders under such Act until September 30, 1980. Directs the Federal Energy Administrator to prohibit coal-burning installations from thereafter burning natural gas as a primary energy source. Requires the issuance of a permit for coal-burning installations to switch to oil as a primary energy source. Directs the Administrator to require disclosure of information relating to domestic coal reserves. Requires that new facilities be capable of utilizing coal or a fuel source other than oil or natural gas. Establishes procedures for extensions of compliance dates and exemptions for facilities otherwise subject to the requirements of this Act. Requires consideration of environmental control requirements where appropriate. Establishes procedures to allow for just compensation for disruption of energy supply contracts caused by operation of the provisions of this Act. Imposes civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Specifies the amount of civil penalties based on amounts of oil and natural gas used in excess of the maximum allowable amount. Authorizes exemptions from compliance with this Act where necessary to protect public health, safety, or welfare during emergencies. Authorizes exemptions for Federal facilities where the President determines such exemption to be in the paramount interest of the United States."
