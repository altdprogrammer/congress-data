Stipulates that the user charges shall equal ten percent of such costs during the first fiscal year after their establishment and shall be increased by such amount for each of the succeeding fiscal years until the maximum of 50 percent of such costs is reached. Requires the Secretary of the Army, in conjunction with the Secretary of Transportation, to submit a report to Congress regarding the implementation of the user charges pursuant to this Act no later than three years after the establishment of such charges."
