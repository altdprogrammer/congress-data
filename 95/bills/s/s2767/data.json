    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 95-886) Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act Amendments - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to extend the authorizations for appropriations for fiscal years 1979 and 1980. Repeals the provisions of such Act which directs the Secretary of Commerce to conduct research on minimizing or ending ocean dumping. Establishes a new procedure for approval of proposed marine sanctuaries, which includes the possibility of a one-House veto within a 120 day period of any proposal over 1,00 square miles. Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue necessary regulations to implement the terms of the sanctuaries designation and (2) conduct such research, surveillance, and enforcement activities as are necessary to carry out the provisions of Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. Sets forth the procedure: (1) to be used by Congress in considering a Presidential proposal to create a marine Sanctuary greater than 1,000 square nautical miles and (2) to discharge a committee from further consideration of a resolution with respect to the document of proposed designation. Provides that: (1) a move to proceed to the floor consideration of the resolution is highly priviledged and is not debatable and (2) motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee of, or the consideration of, a resolution with respect to a document of proposed designation and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business, shall be decided without debate. Sets time limits on debates on a resolution, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution."
