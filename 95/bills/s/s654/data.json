    "text": "Solar Energy Incentives Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow limited income tax credits for the installation of solar heating and cooling equipment in the taxpayer's principal residence or place of business. Makes that portion of the cost of purchasing a new residence or a new commercial building which is attributable to the presence of solar heating and cooling equipment eligible for the credit. Allows rapid amortization of solar heating and cooling equipment installed in commercial buildings. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate standards of eligibility for such equipment. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop such standards for the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration to report annually to the Congress on the operation of this Act."
