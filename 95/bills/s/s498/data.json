Requires air carriers not directly engaged in the operation of aircraft to file a 45 day notice with the Board of such a proposed rate change (previously all air carriers were required to file a 30 day notice). Requires the Board before entering into hearings on the lawfulness of such rate changes to notify the affected air carrier of such action at least 30 days before the effective date of such rate change in the case of air carriers directly engaged in the operation of aircraft, and 15 days before such effective date for air carriers not directly engaged in the operation of aircraft."
