    "text": "Labor-Management Reform Amendments - Amends the Congressional findings and policies declared in the National Labor Relations Act. Stipulates that only bargaining representatives who are chosen by secret ballot may be deemed exclusive representatives with whom employers have a duty to bargain collectively. Deems it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to threaten or impose any fine or other economic sanction against any person in the exercise of rights under the National Relations Act. Permits a labor organization, employer, or ten percent of the members of the appropriate bargaining unit to request a referendum regarding a potential or existing strike. Deems it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to call or maintain a strike if a majority of employees voting in such a referendum vote not to strike or if such a referendum is requested before a strike begins and the results have not yet been certified. Provides that if an employer, labor organization, or group of employees submit a dispute to binding arbitration under an existing collective bargaining agreement, or have agreed to submission, arbitration shall be the exclusive forum and no unfair labor practice proceeding involving the same subject matter may be instituted before the National Labor Relatives Board unless determinations of such arbitration are inconsistent with rights granted under the National Labor Relations Act. Permits any member of a religion , body, or sect which has traditionally objected to membership in and financial support of labor organizations to refrain from joining or supporting a union. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to prohibit use of any procedure by which union dues and other assessments are deducted from employees paychecks in soliciting and collecting contributions for a segregated campaign fund. Makes use of funds by a labor organization for any purpose not directly related to its role as employee representative an unfair labor practice. Prohibits any person from instigating, participating in, or supporting violence, mass picketing, or other coercive conduct at the premises of any person engaged in commerce. Authorizes injunctive relief to enforce express or implied no-strike, no-picket, or no-lockout agreements. Deems it an unfair labor practice for any labor organization, notwithstanding any collective bargaining agreement, to strike or picket for the purpose of requiring an employer to boycott any other person in commerce. Permits a party alleging an unfair labor practice to petition a court (1) for injunctive relief upon issuance of a complaint by the National Labor Relations Board and (2) for enforcement of a National Labor relations Board order. Title II: Enforcement - Transfers from the Secretary of Labor to the Attorney General authority to enforce certain requirements for union elections."
