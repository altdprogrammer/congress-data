    "text": "Title I: Weatherization Grants for the Benefit of Low-Income Families - Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 to permit a raise in the eligible income level for weatherization grants to low-income families. Expands the definition of the term \"weatherization materials\" in such Act to include additional devices and technologies. Limits the amount of financial assistance available under such Act that may be spent on weatherization materials and specified accompanying costs. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a weatherization program financing the installation of weatherization materials in farm residences occupied by low-income families. Title II: Secondary Financing and Loan Insurance for Energy Conserving Improvements - Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act to direct the Federal National Mortgage Association to purchase loans insured under the National Housing Act and made to low- and moderate-income families for the installation of energy conserving improvements in residences owned by such families. Permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to insure a loan for the installation of energy conserving improvements. Specifies the eligibility conditions of such loan. Allows the Government National Mortgage Association to have standby authority to purchase loans for energy-conserving improvements. Title III: Miscellaneous - Permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into annual contributions contracts for low-income projects to finance the installation of energy-conserving improvements. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promote the use of energy saving techniques through minimum property standards established for new rural residential housing assisted under the Housing Act of 1949. Amends the National Housing Act to permit specified increased amounts of assistance if such increase results from increased cost of a residence or project due to the installation of a solar energy system. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to conduct a study for determining the necessity of a mandatory Federal requirement that all residential dwelling units meet energy efficient standards. Directs the Administrators of the Federal Energy Administration and the Community Services Administration and the Secretaries of HUD and of Agriculture to conduct a joint study of the weatherization activities authorized by this Act."
