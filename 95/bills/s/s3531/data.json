Title II: Improved Security for Motor Vehicles and Their Parts - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish standards for motor vehicle safety which include standards to reduce motor vehicle theft by taking into account: (1) the costs and benefits of implementing such standards; (2) the effect of such implementation on automobile insurance costs; (3) savings in terms of time and convenience; and (4) safety considerations. Title III: Antifencing Measures - Establishes penalties for anyone who knowingly removes, obliterates, tampers with, or alters any identification number for any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part required under Department of Transportation regulations. Requires the forfeiture of such motor vehicle or motor vehicle part to the United States, but provides for mitigation of forfeiture whenever an interested person makes an appropriate petition. Establishes penalties for anyone who buys, receives, possesses, or obtains control of, with intent to sell or otherwise dispose of, any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part knowing that such identification number has been removed or altered. Designates as nonmailable matter any manipulative type device which is designed or adapted to operate, circumvent, remove, or render inoperative the ignition switch or lock, or door or truck lock of two or more motor vehicles, or any advertisement for the sale of such device. Title IV: Importation and Exportation Measures - Establishes criminal and civil penalties for anyone who imports, exports, or attempts to import or export any motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or part knowing it has been stolen, or any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part knowing that its identification number has been altered. Requires persons who export or attempt to export a used motor vehicle to present to the appropriate customs officer the vehicle and a document describing that vehicle. Authorizes customs officers to carry firearms, execute and serve search and arrest warrants, serve subpoenas and summonses, and make arrests. Title V: Reporting Requirements - Directs the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, and the Treasury, to report to Congress on developments in vehicle identification of off-road motor vehicles."
