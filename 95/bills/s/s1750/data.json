    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 95-810) Saccharin Study and Labeling Act - Directs the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct a study to assess: (1) current technical capabilities to predict the toxic or carcinogenic effect on humans of substances which have induced cancer in animals; (2) public health benefits and risks of food containing such substances; (3) existing means of evaluating such benefits and risks, and the validity of such analysis; (4) instances in which restrictions on such substances do not accord with benefit-risk analysis; and (5) the relationship between Federal regulatory policies concerning the use of such substances for food and nonfood purposes. Directs the Secretary to request the National Academy of Sciences, or other public or private nonprofit organizations, to conduct the study. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of saccharin and other nonnutritive sweeteners to determine; (1) any impurities in saccharin; (2) the toxic and carcinogenic effects of such impurities; and (3) the health benefits of saccharin and other nonnutritive sweeteners. Requires the Secretary to report, within one year of enactment, to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and to the Senate Committee on Human Resources the results of such study. Requires the Secretary to report, within 15 months of enactment, the results of the assessment conducted under this Act, together with recommendations for legislation deemed necessary. Prohibits the Secretary from restricting (except for labeling requirements allowed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) the sale or distribution of saccharin, or any food, drug, or cosmetic containing saccharin for 18 months. States that foods containing saccharin shall be deemed to be misbranded unless such foods carry a conspicuous warning of the possible hazards to human health. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations requiring retail establishments, where saccharin, or any drug, food, or cosmetic containing saccharin is sold, to display prominently, during the 18 month period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, a notice of saccharin's possible health risks. Authorizes the Secretary by regulation to require that saccharin sold through a vending machine contain such warning notice. Extends for six months the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research."
