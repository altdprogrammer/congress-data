    "text": "Coal Pipeline Act - Authorizes the exercise of the right of eminent domain by any carrier of coal by pipeline who holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Department of the Interior. Enumerates the consideration upon which a finding of public convenience and necessity shall be made. Requires that no carrier granted the power of eminent domain under this Act shall transport any coal in which it has any ownership interest. Establishes procedures for making application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, for antitrust review, and for enforcement under this Act. Imposes a maximum fine of $10,000, six months imprisonment, or both, for knowing violations of any provision of, or regulation issued pursuant to, this Act. Permits States to condition, pursuant to State law, the water rights of a pipeline. Specifies that this Act does not affect existing State, Federal, or interstate compact jurisdiction over water resources. Requires pipelines subject to this Act, consistent with environmental protection, to be buried underground and requires restoration of topsoil on rights-of-way."
