    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1977-01-31", 
    "text": "Equal Education Opportunity Amendments - Amends Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to exempt from the sex discrimination prohibition of such title (1) professional fraternities and sororities, the active membership of which consists primarily of students attending institutions of higher education; and (2) any choir or other similar singing organization sponsored or supervised by an educational institution. Limits the coverage of the sex discrimination prohibition to education programs or activities which are directly receiving Federal financial aid and which are an integral part of the required curriculum. Exempts from the coverage of such title employees of an educational institution. States that nothing in the sex discrimination prohibition of such title shall be construed as authorizing any Federal department or agency to prepare, publish, or enforce, with respect to any educational institution or the programs or activities of such institution, any regulations, rules, or orders relating to: (1) athletics, participation in which is not a required part of the curriculum; or (2) the actual or potential marital or parental status of any applicant or student at any such institution. Requires regulations issued to carry out the provisions of such title to be modified to conform with this Act. States that such modified regulations must be published in the Federal Register and to become effective must be approved by the President. States that nothing in such title shall be construed as requiring the offering of any classes, courses of instruction, or other activities in mixed groups of both sexes. States that general rules of statutory construction shall apply to such title and that the provisions of such title shall not be construed as remedial legislation. Prohibits any Federal department or agency enforcing such title from requiring any affirmative action program or the imposition of quotas. States that the enumeration of any exclusion from provisions of such title shall not be construed as precluding by implication any non-enumerated exclusion in the event regulation under such title otherwise exceeds the authority set forth in such title. Stipulates that nothing contained in such title shall be construed as prohibiting any educational institution or administratively separate unit thereof from adopting any test, standard, or other criterion respecting admission to such institution; or administratively separate unit, or any education program or activity, or for classifications within such institution, unit, program, or activity if such test, standard, or other criterion is reasonably related to a proper educational purpose. Permits such test, standard, or other criterion to be presumed reasonably related to a proper educational purpose if such test, standard, or other criterion is shown to be generally accepted as appropriate for a particular use. Places upon the Federal agency or department seeking to enforce the provisions of such title the burden of proving that any such test, standard, or other criterion, is not reasonably related to a proper educational purpose once such test, standard, or other criterion has been shown to be generally accepted as appropriate for a particular use. Specifies that any such test, standard, or other criterion can be held invalid only upon a showing of clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that it is not used or is not reasonably related to a proper educational purpose."
