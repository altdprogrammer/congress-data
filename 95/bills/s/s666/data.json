I)) Authorizes immediate Civil Service retirement for certain non-Indian employees not entitled to Indian preference who: (1) have completed 25 years of service or are at least 50 years of age and have completed 25 years of service; (2) are involuntarily separated during the two-year period prior to the date the employee would become eligible to retire; and (3) were continuously employed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Indian Health Service, or a tribal organization since June 17, 1974. Provides that the special retirement provisions shall not apply to an employee who is separated after the earlier of the following dates: (1) December 31, 1985; (2) the date five years after the date the employee first meets the age and service requirements for immediate retirement; or (3) the date five years after the date of enactment of this legislation if the employee met such age and service requirements before such date of enactment. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to postpone, for not more than 12 months the retirement of an employee, if such action is necessary for the continued effective operation of the agency and the employee gives his consent. Limits the aggregate of all such postponements to five years. Requires the competitive and excepted service retention registers to be combined for purposes of applying the reduction-in-force procedures. Provides that, for purposes of applying reduction-in-force procedures, employees who are entitled to Indian preference shall be retained in preference to other competing employees who are within the same retention category. Authorizes the reassignment of a non-Indian employee, without regard to the Indian preference laws, when it is determined that such reassignment is necessary: (1) to assure the health or safety of the employee or members of his household; (2) to avoid the displacement of an Indian by such employee during a reduction in force; or (3) because the employee's working relationship with a tribe has so deteriorated that the employee cannot provide effective service. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to submit annual reports to Congress on the actions which they have taken to recruit and train Indians to qualify them for positions which are subject to Indian preference. Requires the Civil Service Commission to provide all appropriate assistance to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service in placing non-Indian employees of such agencies in other Federal positions. Directs all other Federal agencies to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in such efforts. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to submit annual reports to the Congress on the progress of such activities."
