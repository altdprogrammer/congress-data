Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to increase the Federal share of the costs of providing mandatory rail passenger service (emergency operating assistance) during the 18-month period following the first 360 days of such mandatory operation. Increases the amount of obligations which the Secretary of Transportation may incur to furnish such assistance. Authorizes appropriations of $181,000,000 for the liquidation of such obligations through fiscal year 1979."
