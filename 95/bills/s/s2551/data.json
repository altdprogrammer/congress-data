    "text": "Health Planning Amendments and Hospital Services Discontinuation Act - Title I; Three-Year Authorization Extensions - Extends, through fiscal year 1981, the authorization of appropriations under the Public Health Service Act for: (1) planning grants for health systems agencies; (2) grants for state health planning and development; (3) grants for regulating rates for the provision of health care; and (4) grants and for centers for health planning. Title II: Amendments to Health Planning Authorities - Amends the Public Health Service Act (Act) to permit the Governor of any State which comprises part of an interstate health service area, such an area being an entity defined to facilitate health planning and development functions for a specified region, to request the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, without the concurrence of the Governors of other States which are part of such area, to redesignate an interstate area made up of an entire standard metropolitan statistical area. Authorizes the Secretary to change the boundary of a health service area if it would result in an area which better meets requirements specified in the Act. Excludes personnel records from the requirement that Health Systems Agencies (HSA's), State Health Planning and Development Agencies (SHPDA's), and Statewide Health Coordinating Councils (SHCC's) make their records available to the public. Directs that a majority of the members of an HSA governing body shall be those who are not providers of health care and have not within the 12 months preceding appointment been direct providers of health care. Permits HSA's to accept funds or contributions of services or facilities from health care insurers. Permits HSA's and SHPDA's to use funds granted in any fiscal year in the following fiscal year. Repeals the formula under which the amount of a planning grant for a HSA is now determined and states that such amount shall be determined by the Secretary. Requires State certificate of need programs to evaluate the need for major medical equipment. Defines the term major medical equipment to be equipment whose cost or fair market value (whichever is greater) exceeds $150,000. States that the number of representatives on the SHCC to which a health systems agency is entitled shall be proportional to the share of the State's population in the agency's health service area, except that each agency shall be entitled to at least one representative on the SHCC. Authorizes the Governor of a State to select a chairman from among the members of the SHCC; such selection is presently made by the members of the SHCC. Subjects a State health plan to the approval of the State's Governor. Limits HSA's and SHPDA's, in reviewing the facilities, equipment, or services of Health Maintenance Organizations, to those criteria specified by the Secretary, for such review. Title III: Assistance to Hospitals for Discontinuing Inappropriate Inpatient Services - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public or nonprofit hospitals that have been in operation for at least seven years to assist them in discontinuing inappropriate inpatient hospital services. States that, upon the request of a hospital for such a grant, the State health planning and development agency shall determine whether the service to be discontinued is, in fact, inappropriate."
