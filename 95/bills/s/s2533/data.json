    "text": "Gasohol Motor Fuel Act - Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to promote the development and use of alcohol-blended fuels in the United States. Directs the Secretary to study the most suitable raw materials for the production of alcohol-blended fuels. Requires that such study emphasize alternative fuel sources to petroleum and natural gas, and evaluate the efficiency of various production and distribution systems. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within six months after the enactment of this Act concerning the results of such study. Directs the Secretary to set production goals for alcohol- blended fuel development within six months after the completion of the study. Directs the Secretary to require that motor fuel sold in 1981 be one percent alcohol-blended. Sets increasing percentage requirements for succeeding years ending in 1990 where motor fuel shall be ten percent alcohol-blended. Empowers the Secretary to enforce the provisions of this Act and enumerates the enforcement procedures and penalties. Requires that all facilities constructed to distill alcohol for motor fuel use shall use fuel sources which are renewable. Directs the Secretary to establish, within six months after the enactment of this Act, procedures for the certification of alcohol distilling facilities. Requires the Secretary to give first priority for fuel sources to operate such distillation facilities to renewable energy resources. Grants last priority for fuel sources to petroleum, petroleum derivatives and natural gas. Empowers the Secretary to waive the preference for renewable resources upon a finding that they are economically or technically infeasible for use as fuel sources to power distillation facilities."
