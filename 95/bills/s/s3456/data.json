    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1978-08-24", 
    "text": "Amends the Federal Seed Act to delete the list of noxious-weed seeds and to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation the kinds of weed seeds that would be considered noxious when occurring in imported seed. Deletes the definition of seed \"type\". Revises the definition of \"pure-live seed.\" Prohibits the shipment of agricultural and of lawn and turf seed into a State if the seed contains weed seeds in excess of the percentage permitted by State law. Requires labeling the rate of occurrence of noxious-weed seeds in vegetable seeds, and prohibits certain noxious-weed seeds in packages of one pound or more. Removes, with respect to interstate commerce and to importation in foreign commerce, the requirement for labeling treated seed when the seed bears only nontoxic amounts of substances (or no substance at all) and is within the tolerances recognized by regulations of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for food or feed. Requires the distinctive coloring of any seed which does bear a harmful substance. Exempts from existing detailed labeling requirements seed shipped between branches of the same wholesale seed company, if the invoice or records accompanying such seed bear statements containing the information that would otherwise be required on the labeling. Deletes the list of kinds of screenings of seeds exempt from importation prohibition, and authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation the kinds of screenings to be exempted. Requires that, before a rule or regulation is promulgated under such Act, interested persons shall be given an opportunity to present views in writing or orally, or to request a public hearing. Increases the maximum forfeiture for violation of such Act from $500 to $1,000. Extends the prohibition now applicable only to the sale of uncertified seed, to the offer for sale or advertisement of such seed as well."
