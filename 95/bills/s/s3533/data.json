Specifies types of savings accounts which qualify for the credit. Increases taxpayer liability (except for individuals who attain age 65) if the taxpayer's eligible net saving is less than zero for a taxable year. Provides for an inflation adjustment to the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for purposes of determining the allowable amount of credit."
