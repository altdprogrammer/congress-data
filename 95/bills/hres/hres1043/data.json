Urges action: (1) to institute voluntary land diversion programs for 1978 for wheat, feed grains, and upland cotton; (2) to impose a uniform limitation on the acreage planted to upland cotton in 1978, amounting to a 20 percent reduction from the cotton acreage in 1977; (3) to establish price support loan rates for the 1978 crops of wheat, feed grains, and soybeans at levels sufficient to cover the average cost of production; and (4) to formulate and implement a program for the expansion of export sales of American agricultural commodities, including increased sales under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480)."
