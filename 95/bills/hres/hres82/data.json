    "text": "Establishes within the House of Representatives a Select Committee on Intelligence to study the intelligence activities of the United States including the analytical capabilities of United States foreign intelligence agencies; the organization of intelligence activities in the executive branch to maximize the effectiveness of the conduct, oversight, and accountability of such activities; the conduct of covert and Clandestine activities; and the authorization of funds for the intelligence activities of the Government and whether disclosure of the amounts of such funds is in the public interest. Requires the Committee to report the results of its study together with its recommendations for legislative or other action no later than July 1, 1978. States that the Committee shall obtain an annual report from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which shall review the intelligence activities of the agency or department concerned and the intelligence activities of foreign countries directed at the U. S. Sets forth standards for handling classified information in the possession of the Committee. States that it shall be the duty of the Committee of Standards of Official Conduct to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer, or employee of the House of Representatives and to report to the House concerning any allegation which it finds to be substantiated. Authorizes the Committee to permit any personal representative of the President, designated by the President to serve as a liaison to the Committee, to attend any closed meeting of the Committee. States that all records, files, documents, and other material in the possession or control of the House Select Committee on Intelligence during the Ninety-Fourth Congress shall be transferred to the select committee established by this resolution. States that it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the head of any department or agency of the United States involved in any intelligence activities should furnish any information or document in the possession, custody, or control of the department or agency, or person paid by such department or agency, whenever requested by the select committee with respect to any matter within such committee's jurisdiction. States further that it is the sense of the House of Representatives that each department and agency of the United States should report immediately upon discovery to the select committee any and all intelligence activities which constitute violations of the constitutional rights of any person, violations of law, or violations of Executive orders, Presidential directives, or departmental or agency rules or regulations; each department and agency should further report to such committee what actions have been taken or are expected to be taken by the department or agencies with respect to such violations."
