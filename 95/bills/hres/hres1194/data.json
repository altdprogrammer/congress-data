Rept. 95-1222) Expresses the sense of the House that the Government of the Republic of Korea should cooperate fully with the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and its special counsel in the efforts of such committee to obtain information needed, to complete its investigation, from the former Korean Ambassador Kim Dong Jo. Requires that such information be obtained from Kim Dong Jo under oath, affirmation, or comparable means of assuring reliability which are satisfactory to the committee. States that the House will consider a refusal to provide at an early date the necessary information as of serious consequence for United States-Korean relations and will be prepared to deny or reduce funds for nonmilitary assistance for the Republic of Korea, unless such denial would harm the national security of the United States or imperil the territorial integrity of the Republic of Korea. Expresses the sense of the House that such denial or reduction of assistance would not, at the present time, imperil the national security of the United States or the territorial integrity of the Republic of Korea."
