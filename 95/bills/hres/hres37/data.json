Requests the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe to transmit to Congress a report on the freedom to emigrate from Romania and the status of minorities in Romania. Declares it the sense of the House of Representatives that the 1975 United States-Romanian Trade Agreement and the most-favored-nation status of Romania should be terminated if Romania continues to restrict the human rights of its citizens."
