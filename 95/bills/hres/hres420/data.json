Rept. 95-114) Establishes the Select Committee on Congressional Operations in the House of Representatives to continue the functions of the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations for the House. Requires the select committee to: (1) make a continuing study of the organization and operation of Congress and recommend improvements; (2) identify any court proceeding or action of vital interest to Congress or the House; (3) conduct a continuing study of the jurisdiction of various standing committees of the House, their work loads, and ways of rationalizing committee jurisdictions between the two Houses of Congress; and (4) supervise and control the functions of the Office of Placement and Office Management as they relate to the House. Authorizes the select committee to appoint certain staff members at specified rates of pay. States that this resolution shall not be construed to authorize the select committee to operate or supervise a permanent system for the broadcast coverage of House proceedings without the express and prior approval of the House. Allows the select committee, subject to the adoption of expense resolutions, to incur expenses in connection with its duties under this Act."
