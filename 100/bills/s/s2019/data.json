    "text": "Savers and Investors Act of 1988 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt any tax deferred account (defined in this Act) from taxation, except for taxes imposed on the unrelated business income of certain tax-exempt organizations. Requires such an account to be in the form of a trust created for the exclusive benefit of an individual or beneficiary. Enumerates other qualifying criteria and limitations governing the accounts. Taxes account distributions as ordinary income, but permits a tax-free rollover from one account to another. Lists special rules in connection with an account's loss of tax-exempt status. Requires the account trustee to report account data to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the investor."
