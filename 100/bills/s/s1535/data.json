    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make available to an employer a credit against income tax liability for expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year to acquire, construct, rehabilitate, or expand an on-site day care facility operated by the employer for the care of enrollees, at least 30 percent of whom must be dependents of the employer's employees. Limits the amount of the credit based on the number of enrollees who may be cared for in the facility at one time. Provides for recapture of the credit if the facility ceases operation or changes ownership. Describes how the credit would function with respect to controlled groups of corporations, multiple employers, and partnerships. Sets out rules to govern the pass-through of credit when applicable."
