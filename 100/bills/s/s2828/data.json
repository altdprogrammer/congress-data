Amends the Small Business Act to authorize compensatory grants to homeowners or businesses for losses incurred as a result of injurious fires identified by the Commission. Sets the amount of such grants. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize grants for loans for losses incurred as a result of injurious fires identified by the Commission. Sets the amount of such grants."
