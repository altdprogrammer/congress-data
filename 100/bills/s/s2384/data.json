    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1988-09-28", 
    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Environment and Public Works with amendment, S. Rept. 100-558) Authorizes appropriations for the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act for FY 1989 through 1991. Makes such Act effective until the end of FY 1991. Extends the funding of striped bass studies under the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act through FY 1991. Authorizes the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to make specified determinations at any other time it deems necessary (in addition to its required annual determinations in December of each fiscal year). Requires the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for Fisheries, to: (1) undertake a study of the striped bass fishery resources and habitats of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area; (2) develop short-term and long-term recommendations for Federal and State government agencies for restoring and conserving such resources and habitats; and (3) submit such study results and recommendations to the Congress and the States of North Carolina and Virginia, within 36 months after enactment of this Act. Provides for study contents, participation by specified State and Federal agencies, and consultation with various entities. Authorizes appropriations for such study. Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce, when State regulations or a Federal moratorium on Atlantic striped bass fishing within the coastal waters of coastal State is in effect, to promulgate regulations governing Atlantic striped bass fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone. Requires Federal regulations to be consistent with national standards and appropriate to: (1) ensure the effectiveness of such State regulations or Federal moratorium; and (2) achieve conservation and management goals for the Atlantic striped bass resource. Allows the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils to prepare a fishery management plan on Atlantic striped bass. Declares that, if a plan is approved and implemented by the Secretary, it shall supersede any regulations promulgated by a State under this Act. Terminates the provisions of this Act relating to regulation of striped bass fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone on September 30, 1991. Amends provisions of Federal law relating to the stationing of a U.S. observer aboard each foreign fishing vessel while in certain waters to substitute references to the Exclusive Economic Zone for references to the fishery conservation zone."
