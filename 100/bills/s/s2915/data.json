Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to require that priority for discretionary research and demonstration grants be given to activities related to the identification and prevention of child abuse and neglect. Makes technical revisions to such Act with respect to specified provisions for grants and contracts, extensions of waivers of certain requirements for States, grants and technical assistance to States for programs for disabled infants with life-threatening conditions, and authorizations of appropriations. Replaces a reference to the Office of Human Development Services with a reference to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Department responsible for administration of the program under such Act. Amends title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to provide that such title may be cited as the Adoption Opportunities Act. Amends the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to raise from $150,000 to $200,000 the maximum amount which any one family violence shelter may receive under a demonstration grants program."
