    "text": "Standard Nuclear Reactor Development Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a standard reactor program to develop an inherently safe economic nuclear reactor to be available for purchase by utilities by the year 2000. Establishes the Office of Standard Reactor Development in the Department of Energy to be headed by an Assistant Secretary of Energy for Standard Reactor Development. Directs the Secretary to submit a program implementation plan to the Congress within one year of enactment of this Act. Outlines the contents of such plan. Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish a standard reactor project to: (1) assist the Secretary in the development of standard reactor designs; and (2) facilitate the licensing of reactors based on such designs. Requires the Commission to specify the tests and evaluations that a prototype or demonstration reactor based on a standard reactor design must undergo and to promulgate regulations governing standard reactor siting, design, construction, and operation. Mandates that the Commission submit quarterly reports to the Congress regarding standard reactor activities and promptly inform the Congress of any safety or licensing problems that could interfere with the objectives of this Act. Terminates the standard reactor office and the program 20 years after the date of enactment of this Act or when this Act's purposes have been fulfilled."
