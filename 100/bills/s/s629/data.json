Allows such grants to provide for the training of personnel to provide English language instruction and for support services including child care and transportation costs for program participants. Provides that such grants may be made to community-based organizations, local education agencies, tribally-controlled schools, institutions of higher education (including community colleges), public libraries, and prisons. Sets forth grant application requirements. Limits grants to not more than three years' duration. Requires that at least 50 percent of grant funds go to community-based organizations with the demonstrated capability to administer English proficiency programs. Requires grant recipients to report annually to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, through the Office of Adult Education, directly and through grants and contracts, to carry out demonstration programs to: (1) develop innovative approaches and methods of literacy education for individuals of limited English proficiency; and (2) establish a nationwide clearinghouse on literacy education for individuals of limited English proficiency. Requires the Secretary, directly and through grants and contracts, to evaluate and annually audit programs funded under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to accept grants, gifts, or bequests of money for the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990.
