    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1987-04-24", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1987 - Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Amends the following Acts to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989: (1) the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966; and (2) the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act with respect to bumper standards, automobile consumer information, and odometer requirements. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to derive a specified maximum amount from unobligated highway safety program funds to implement a national program encouraging the use of safety belts and passive restraints (airbags) in passenger automobiles. Title II: Side Impact Protection and Crashworthiness Data - Directs the Secretary to reopen certain rulemaking proceedings to implement Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 214. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish performance criteria for improved occupant protection in side impacts; and (2) issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to extend the applicability of such Standard to multipurpose passenger vehicles. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary to enter into arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to study means of establishing a method for calculating a uniform numerical rating enabling consumers to compare meaningful passenger automobile crashworthiness data. Prescribes the contents of such study. Requires that a report of such study be submitted to the Secretary and the Congress within 19 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Prescribes schedules for: (1) obtaining public comment on implementation of National Academy recommendations; (2) determining whether an objectively based system of comparative crashworthiness data can be established; (3) promulgating a rule to establish such a system, if the determination is positive; (4) submitting the proposed rule for review to specified congressional committees; (5) waiting 60 calendar days after such submission, unless both committees notify the Secretary that they have no objection to the rule; and (6) establishing (by rule) procedures requiring auto dealers to make comparative crashworthiness data available to prospective customers. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to direct the Secretary to: (1) establish a schedule for use in ensuring compliance with each Federal motor vehicle safety standard established under this Act which the Secretary determines is capable of being tested; (2) establish written guidelines and procedures for conducting investigations regarding noncompliance with the regulations issued under this Act; and (3) establish criteria for the determination and imposition of civil penalties for such noncompliance. Amends Federal law to prohibit the Secretary from approving, after 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, any State highway safety program which does not provide for a uniform system for handicapped parking according to prescribed guidelines. Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking to: (1) revise specified motor vehicle safety standards regarding multipurpose passenger vehicles; (2) review the classification system for vehicles with a gross weight under 10,000 pounds to determine if such vehicles should be reclassified; and (3) amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 to provide that lap and shoulder seatbelt protection for outboard rear seat passengers should be installed in passenger automobiles after specified dates. Mandates that a specified percentage of certain authorized appropriations shall be used to disseminate consumer information regarding retrofitting passenger automobiles with lap and shoulder rear seatbelts. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to direct the Secretary to: (1) promulgate regulations establishing passenger motor vehicle bumper system labeling requirements; and (2) arrange with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of specified aspects of the effectiveness of State motor vehicle safety inspection programs for transmittal to certain congressional committees. Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to direct the manufacturer of a defective motor vehicle or motor vehicle part to send a second notification if the Secretary determines that the first notification sent by such manufacturer has not resulted in an adequate number of vehicles (or items of equipment) being returned for remedy. Requires any lessor who receives notification of a defective motor vehicle part pertaining to any leased motor vehicle to send a copy of such notice to the lessee. Provides that a dealer may only sell or lease a motor vehicle (or motor vehicle item) for which a safety defect notice has been received only if: (1) the defect or failure to comply has been remedied before delivery under sale or lease; or (2) an enforcement order has been set aside or restrained. Directs the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct a study of the use of darkened windshields and window glass in passenger automobiles, and to submit the results of such study to certain congressional committees. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to prohibit any State from issuing a motor vehicle registration card unless the application for such card contains specified odometer information. Requires the Secretary to promulgate rules regarding falsification and unauthorized alteration of title and mileage information. Prohibits the Secretary from approving State alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements unless the Secretary determines that such alternate method is consistent with the purposes of such Act."
