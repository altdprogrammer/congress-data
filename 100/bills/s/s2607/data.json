    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments of 1988 - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to require the General Accounting Office to submit to the Congress annual audits and summaries of the housing and shelter programs under such Act. (Current law requires audits to be submitted quarterly and annually.) Provides that the Interagency Council on the Homeless shall appoint at least two but not more than five regional employees to coordinate Council activities in the ten standard Federal regions. Includes among Council duties: (1) the holding of specified on-site regional workshops; and (2) the preparation and distribution of a bimonthly bulletin summarizing Federal homeless resources. Requires each Federal agency administering a program under such Act to submit to the Council, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, timetables regarding program funding availability and application deadlines. Requires the Council to furnish such information to each State Interagency Council, State agency, and State coordinator. Authorizes FY 1989 and 1990 appropriations for the Council. Extends the Council's legislative authority through October 1, 1990. Encourages each State to establish a State Interagency Council on the Homeless. Sets forth State Council functions, including the provision of information about Federal programs for the homeless. Authorizes each Governor to designate a State Coordinator to coordinate the State Council and to coordinate with the Council and other Federal agencies. Authorizes the Council to award a grant to supplement the compensation of the State Coordinator in order to encourage States to designate such positions. Requires a State not establishing a State Council or State Coordinator to designate a lead agency to coordinate Federal and State homeless activities. Authorizes FY 1989 and 1990 appropriations for the Federal emergency management food and shelter program. Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to identify buildings that are suitable for use by the homeless within two months after collecting information about underutilized Federal properties. States that such property shall be available to the homeless on an interim basis. Substitutes the term \"underutilized Federal buildings\" for \"surplus Federal buildings.\" Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to report, within six months after enactment of this Act, to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the emergency food and shelter grant program, including alternative distribution and disbursement formulas."
