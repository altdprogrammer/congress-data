Declares that the general authorities and policies of the development assistance provisions of such Act apply to this Act.

Requires the Administrator to develop a plan for evaluating the agency's progress in achieving the purposes of this Act. Requires the plan to provide for: (1) the establishment of specific criteria for measuring the performance of U.S. development assistance for the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) the collection and monitoring of base-line data for future measurement of the effectiveness of such assistance; and (3) the measures by which the evaluations will be used to institutionalize learning within the agency. Requires the plan to be developed in consultation with specified congressional committees. Requires that assistance from other assistance and development programs shall be used to provide assistance fo the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa.
