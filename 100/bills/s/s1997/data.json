Makes identical changes to the reduction in such pay for members of the Selected Reserve component of the armed forces. Provides that, in the event of the service-connected death of an individual whose basic pay has been reduced for the provision of basic educational assistance and who had not received such educational assistance, the Administrator shall pay to the living survivors (in a specified order of priority) the amount by which the individual's basic pay had been so reduced exceeds the total amount of educational assistance paid to such individual."
