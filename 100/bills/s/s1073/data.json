    "text": "Readfare Act - Amends the Adult Education Act to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants to States with approved plans to pay the Federal share of the cost of establishing a literacy program for welfare and food stamp recipients. Permits such grants to be used for programs by local educational agencies, and public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions. Sets forth State plan requirements for program descriptions. Requires States, from allotted funds, to establish such a literacy training program for recipients receiving benefits under the Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program of the Social Security Act or under the Food Stamp Act, if such recipients need literacy training and are required to receive it under such Acts. Requires States to provide for testing, literacy training, outreach activities, and screening procedures. Requires the State adult education agency to consult with State agencies for AFDC and food stamps in carrying out the literacy training program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991 for such program. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and the Social Security Act to require illiterate food stamp program and AFDC program participants, with specified exceptions, to participate in the literacy training program. Provides for related transportation and child care costs."
