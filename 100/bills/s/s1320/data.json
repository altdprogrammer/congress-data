    "text": "Solar Development Initiative Act of 1987 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the authorizations provided by this Act indicate the minimum levels for a solar research effort that is sensitive to both the Federal deficit and to the growth of the domestic solar energy industry. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 for specified Federal solar energy research and development programs. Directs the Secretary of Energy to include in the FY 1989 budget the funding necessary to implement a solar and renewable energy research program which: (1) has near-term commercial applications; and (2) enhances the international competitiveness of the solar and renewable energy industries. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an information-dissemination program for Federal procurement and loan officers regarding the application of solar heating and cooling technology in Federal buildings. Directs the Committee on Renewable Energy, Commerce, and Trade to continue to coordinate Federal programs affecting commerce in renewable energy products and services. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the renewable energy technologies programs established by the Secretary of Commerce should be funded in FY 1988 through 1990 through the Department of Energy at a specified minimum level. Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to direct the President to take into account, when determining whether to designate a beneficiary country, the degree to which it undertakes self-help measures to promote energy self-sufficiency using locally available renewable resources. Mandates that the design for new Federal facilities for specified agencies include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable energy forms. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to mandate that a specified percentage of loan authority be available only for solar and renewable energy loans. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the use of administrative funds for incentives, grants, and studies for renewable energy and other small business activities. Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) repeal provisions regarding loans to small business concerns for solar energy and energy conservation measures; (2) mandate that a certain percentage of loan authority be used only for small business energy measures; and (3) direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to give due consideration to the export potential of solar and renewable energy products, and to include a list of solar and renewable energy loan guarantees in an annual report to the Congress."
