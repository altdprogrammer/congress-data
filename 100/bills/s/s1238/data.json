    "text": "Bilingual Education Act Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Bilingual Education Act (the Act) to recognize that, regardless of the method of instruction, programs which serve limited English proficient students have the equally important goals of developing academic achievement and English proficiency. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to reserve up to 25 percent of bilingual education financial assistance appropriations for special alternative instructional programs, programs of developmental bilingual education, programs of academic excellence, family literacy programs, and bilingual preschool, special education, and gifted and talented programs preparatory or supplementary to programs such as those assisted under this Act. Provides that the 25 percent reservation shall not result in changing the terms, conditions, and negotiated levels of any grant awarded in FY 1987 to which specified provisions apply. Limits individual student enrollment in a bilingual program to three years, except under specified circumstances under which it may be extended for one or two more years. Allows for intensification of instruction for limited English proficient students by: (1) including before and after school and summer programs; (2) lowering per pupil ratios; and (3) applying technology to the course of instruction. Sets forth priorities for applications for special alternative instructional program grants."
