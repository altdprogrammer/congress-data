    "text": "Medicare Appeal Rights Preservation Act of 1987 - Provides that, during the six months after enactment of this Act, any hearing conducted under provisions of the Social Security Act relating to determination of entitlement to and amount of benefits under title XVIII (Medicare) of such Act shall be conducted by administrative law judges employed by the Social Security Administration to the same extent and in the same manner as are hearings conducted under specified provisions of title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of such Act. Prohibits requiring, as a precondition to receiving such a Medicare hearing with respect to a claim for not less than $500 under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance for Aged and Disabled) of such Act, participation in a hearing under provisions relating to use of carriers for administration of benefits. Directs the Comptroller General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to conduct a study of the feasibility of conducting such Medicare hearings on other than an in-person basis before administrative law judges of the Social Security Administration."
