Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the gross income of an individual any interest on educational savings bonds redeemed within 300 months of issuance to the extent: (1) the aggregate face amount of the bonds is $1,000; and (2) the interest is used to pay the higher education expenses (tuition, fees, books, supplies, meals, and lodging) of a dependent at either an institution of higher education or a vocational school."
