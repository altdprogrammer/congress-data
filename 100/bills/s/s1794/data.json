Establishes within the Department of Transportation the High-Speed Ground Transportation Office (to be headed by a Director), whose functions shall be to establish uniform standards and regulate the design and construction for such technology, as well as recommend funding mechanisms. Mandates that such Office conduct a prescribed feasibility study regarding such high-speed transportation system. Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and to the High-Speed Ground Transportation Office to implement this Act."
