Repeals the requirement that professional or graduate institutions eligible for such grants be \"independent\" (thus allowing State-affiliated institutions to qualify). Adds to the list of institutions specifically eligible for such grants: (1) Thurgood Marshall School of Law (at Texas Southern University); (2) North Carolina Central University School of Law; (3) Southern University School of Law (in Louisiana); and (4) Florida A&M College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Graduate Program)."
