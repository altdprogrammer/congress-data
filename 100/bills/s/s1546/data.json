Allows the President to reregister such vessels if, within a specified time, the President determines and certifies to the Congress that the exercise of such authority for an additional period of time is vital to the national security interests of the United States and if the Congress enacts a joint resolution authorizing such actions. Sets forth special rules for the consideration of such a joint resolution."
