    "text": "Atlantic Marine Fisheries Act of 1988 - Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce, when State regulations or a Federal moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass within the coastal waters of a coastal State are in effect, to promulgate regulations governing fishing for such fish in the exclusive economic zone. Authorizes the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils to prepare a fishery management plan on Atlantic striped bass. Provides that such plan, if approved and implemented by the Secretary, shall supersede any regulations promulgated under this Act. Terminates provisions of this Act relating to fishing regulations and authorization of a fishery management plan on September 30, 1991. Amends the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act to authorize appropriations for 1988 through 1991. Extends the termination date for such Act to September 30, 1991. Amends the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991."
