Directs the Secretary of Education to reserve 25 percent of certain funds appropriated under the Act for special alternative instruction programs and related activities, including specified programs. (Current law requires that up to four percent of such funds be reserved for such activities.) States that no student may be enrolled in a bilingual program for more than three school years, but allows four or five years' enrollment under specified conditions. Sets forth conditions under which applications for grants for special alternative instructional programs for students of limited English proficiency shall receive priority."
