Defines \"public conveyance\" as any vehicle of a privately or publicly owned common carrier providing passenger service, including air, rail, boat, ship, or bus service. Establishes fines in specified amounts for violations of this Act. Authorizes any person who is aggrieved by a violation of this Act to bring an action for injunctive relief in the appropriate Federal district court. Authorizes the court to award costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys. Authorizes the States to enforce State laws relating to smoking which are more restrictive than the provisions of this Act."
