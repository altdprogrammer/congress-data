    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Court Interpreter Amendments Act of 1988 - Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to establish a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States. Requires the Director to certify interpreters for the hearing impaired and persons who speak only or primarily a language other than English. Authorizes the Director to certify interpreters: (1) for any language if the Director determines a need; (2) upon request of the Judicial Conference of the United States; and (3) upon request from the judicial council of a circuit and approval of the Judicial Conference. Bases certification on the results of criterion-referenced performance examinations. Requires the Director to establish criteria for the selection of otherwise qualified interpreters to provide services: (1) in languages for which no interpreters have been certified; and (2) where no certified interpreter is reasonably available. Requires the Director to maintain a list of all certified interpreters. Calls for periodic, rather than annual, reporting in connection with the use and performance of interpreters. Subjects their fees to periodic review. Requires the clerk or district executive of a court to secure the services of interpreters for proceedings initiated by the United States. Directs the presiding judicial official, upon the motion of any party, to determine whether to require electronic sound recording of judicial proceedings during which an interpreter is used. Describes criteria to be considered when making the determination. Requires the portions of grand jury proceedings in which an interpreter is used to be electronically sound-recorded if the accused so moves. Authorizes appropriations for the establishment of the interpreter program."
