    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Integrity in Post Employment Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding former Federal employees attempting to influence the Government. Makes it unlawful, within one year after employment or service has ceased, for: (1) former senior officials to lobby their former employing agency; (2) former top level officials (Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries) to lobby any executive or independent agency or any Member of Congress; and (3) former Members of Congress to lobby any entity of the legislative branch or any top level official of the executive branch. Prohibits any senior or top level official, within 18 months after employment has ceased, from being employed by, representing, or advising a foreign entity for compensation, financial gain, or other remuneration. Prohibits any person from acting as an agent and communicating on behalf of such former officials and Members of Congress. Includes as exceptions to such prohibitions: (1) any person who is engaging solely in the solicitation or collection of funds and contributions within the United States to be used only for medical assistance, food, or clothing to relieve human suffering; or (2) any person who is providing a statement based on that person's special knowledge, provided that no compensation is received for such statement other than that regularly provided by law for witnesses. Increases the criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Prohibits the partner of a Member, officer, or employee of the legislative branch in a partnership for the provision of professional services from acting as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise representing, any other person other than the United States in lobbying activities in either House of Congress. Provides for the imposition of penalties upon any Member of Congress who: (1) affiliates with a firm, partnership, association, or corporation for the purpose of providing professional services for compensation; (2) permits the use of the Member's name by such firm, partnership, association, or corporation; or (3) practices a profession for compensation. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit Members of Congress from converting excess campaign funds to their personal use. Title II: Fairness in Personal Campaign Expenditures - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit any candidate for Federal office who makes expenditures from personal funds or the personal funds of the candidate's immediate family to the candidate's campaign committee, or makes a loan from such funds to such committee, from using any other contributions made after the election to such candidate or committee to repay such expenditure or loan."
