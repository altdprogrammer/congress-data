Expresses the sense of the Congress that after the addition of such statue, no further additions to the site should be authorized or undertaken. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to select a site for the statue within the Memorial with the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission. Makes the design proposal subject to the approval of the Secretary and such Commissions. Prohibits the United States or the District of Columbia from paying any expense of constructing the statue. Requires that the construction of such statue be commenced within five years of the date of enactment of this Act, and that funds sufficient to insure completion are certified to be available by the Secretary prior to groundbreaking, or the authority provided by this Act shall lapse. Grants the Secretary the responsibility for the statue's maintenance and care."
