Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands and interests in lands by donation, purchase with appropriated or donated funds, exchange, or transfer. Provides for the administration of the Monument. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with: (1) New Mexico or Albuquerque for the management and interpretation of any lands owned by those jurisdictions within the boundaries of the Monument; and (2) other Federal, State, and local public departments and agencies providing for the interpretation of the natural, cultural, and recreational resources of the West Mesa and its environs.
