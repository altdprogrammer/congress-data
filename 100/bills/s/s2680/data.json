    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) New Jersey-New York-Connecticut Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a demonstration program, within nine months of this Act's enactment, to track, by the use of a manifest system, medical waste generated and disposed of in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Includes in such program the monitoring of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New England beaches, where there have been reported incidences of medical waste being washed up on shore. Makes such program applicable to generators of medical waste and owners and operators of facilities for the treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of medical waste. Requires such parties to permit access to, and provide copies of, all records relating to such wastes to any designated representative of the EPA. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of program requirements. Provides that this Act does not preclude any State or locality from imposing more stringent requirements for the control or monitoring of medical waste, or affect the authorities or requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress, within three years of this Act's enactment, on the progress and success of the demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes and directs the Administrator to use authority provided in the Solid Waste Disposal Act to immediately address and correct the improper disposal of medical waste."
