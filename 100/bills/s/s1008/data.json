    "date": "1987-04-10", 
    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit a person from transporting nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel without a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Sets forth the application requirements and mandates the inclusion of an emergency response and mitigation plan outlining procedures to be taken in the event of a release or potential release of radioactive waste. Requires the Commission to prepare an environmental analysis according to specified guidelines prior to issuing a radioactive waste transportation license. Sets forth the conditions under which the Commission is authorized to issue such a license. Requires specified Federal bodies, in consultation with the States and affected Indian tribes, to determine the emergency response capabilities of corridor States and affected Indian tribes. Mandates the development and exercise of such emergency response plans within 12 months after a transportation license is issued. Proscribes any shipments unless such plans are developed and periodically exercised. Identifies the types of regulations which the States and Indian tribes may impose. States that such nuclear waste transportation restrictions are inapplicable if the Commission certifies that there are compelling reasons of public safety or national security which necessitate the immediate transportation of the waste to another site or facility."
