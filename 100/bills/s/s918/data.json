(Currently, such choice must be made simultaneously upon entering service.) Makes the same change for individuals first entering the Selected Reserve. Removes authority to make advance payments of subsistence allowances. Removes a provision allowing a veteran to be paid in advance for certain work to be performed under a work-study program. Revises provisions concerning compliance surveys conducted by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs of institutions offering courses approved for the instruction of veterans. Title II: Repeal of Education Loan Program; Technical Amendments - Repeals Federal provisions: (1) authorizing a veteran to use any unused educational assistance benefits for eligibility for an education loan; (2) authorizing accelerated (advanced) payment of educational assistance allowances; and (3) authorizing educational loans to any veteran. Title III: Savings Provision - States that loans made and accounts established for the collection of deposits made before the effective date of this Act shall continue in effect until completed."
