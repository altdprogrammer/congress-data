    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Title I: Omnibus Oregon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1988 - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate the following river segments in Oregon as scenic, wild, or recreational rivers: (1) Big Marsh Creek; (2) Chetco; (3) Clackamas; (4) Crescent Creek; (5) Crooked; (6) Deschutes; (7) Donner and Blitzen; (8) Eagle Creek; (9) Elk; (10) Grande Ronde; (11) Imnaha; (12) John Day; (13) Joseph Creek; (14) Little Deschutes; (15) Lostine; (16) Malheur; (17) McKenzie; (18) Metolius; (19) Minam; (20) North Fort Crooked; (21) North Fork John Day; (22) North Fork Malheur; (23) North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Williamette; (24) North Fork Owyhee; (25) North Fork Smith; (26) North Fork Sprague; (27) North Powder; (28) North Umpqua; (29) Powder; (30) Quartzville Creek; (31) Roaring; (32) Salmon; (33) Sandy; (34) South Fork Imnaha; (35) South Fork John Day; (36) Squaw; (37) Sycan; (38) Upper Rogue; (39) Wenaha; (40) West Little Owyhee; and (41) White. Designates the following river segments in Oregon for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System: (1) Blue; (2) Chewaucan; (3) North Fork Malheur; (4) South Fork Mckenzie; (5) Steamboat Creek; and (6) Wallowa. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to complete a study on the eligibility of a specified segment of the Upper Klamath River for potential addition to such System. Requires such study to be completed and a report on its results submitted to the Congress by April 1, 1990. Prohibits lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or individual Indian from being included within the boundaries of the Deschutes or Metolius Rivers without the consent of the applicable tribal council. Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to consult and enter into cooperative management agreements with Indian tribes for planning, administration, and management of Indian treaty lands that are included within System lands. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Umatilla Basin Project, Oregon - Umatilla Basin Project Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to construct, operate, and maintain the Umatilla Basin Project, Oregon, in accordance with the report of the Secretary dated February 12, 1988. Declares the purpose of such project to mitigate losses to anadromous fishery resources and continuing water service to the Hermiston, West Extension, Westland, and Stanfield Irrigation Districts, for the project water exchange. Declares the principal works of such project to consist of: (1) lands, water rights, or interests therein acquired for the benefit of fishery resources; (2) measures to conserve water and improve the drainage systems of the project; (3) pumping plants and related conveyance and distribution features; (4) works incidental to existing irrigation system necessary to accomplish a water exchange; (5) fishery resources mitigation measures; and (6) programs to monitor and regulate project operations and evaluate fishery resource mitigation measures. Requires project features to be integrated and coordinated with the existing Umatilla Project. Requires the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to provide for project power needed to effect the water exchange with irrigation districts in accordance with the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program established under the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act. Requires the cost of project power to be credited to fishery restoration goals of the Program. Makes non-Federal interests responsible for the cost of operating and maintaining the project, except for those costs associated with the project water exchange and mitigation of losses to anadromous fisheries resources. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for the operation and maintenance of the existing pumping facilities as an interim measure to provide flow augmentation in the Umatilla River. Provides for the crediting of non-Federal costs for fishery resource improvements. Provides that when project pumping capacity is available in excess of that needed for fishery resource benefits, such capacity shall be available to eligible irrigation districts participating in the project. Requires the irrigation districts to pay the costs of such power which shall be provided from the Federal Columbia River power system. Authorizes appropriations for the Secretary to purchase land, water rights, or other interests for the benefit of fishery resources consistent with the purposes of this Act. Authorizes construction appropriations. Declares that nothing in this Act alters existing water rights. Declares irrigation districts participating in the project eligible for financial assistance under the Rehabilitation and Betterment Act for water conservation purposes and improvements to water supply systems. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, within one year after enactment of this title, to complete a review of the current operations of the project. Directs the Secretary, within 90 days of the completion of such review, to transmit a report to the House Committee on the Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources."
