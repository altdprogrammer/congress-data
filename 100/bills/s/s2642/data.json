    "text": "National Geography Studies Centers Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to enter into a contract with the Education Foundation of the National Geographic Society (the contractor) to pay the Federal share (75 percent) of the cost of establishing and operating National Geography Studies Centers for the study of geography in elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes the contractor to enter into contracts with or make grants to local educational agencies, State educational agencies, State higher educational agencies, institutions of higher education, or consortia thereof, to establish and operate such Centers. Requires each Center to: (1) support programs for geography study by elementary and secondary school students, that may include laboratory schools and summer institutes; (2) support programs which provide elementary and secondary school teacher retraining and inservice training in geography; and (3) establish procedures, through an advisory panel, for selecting students and teachers for center-supported programs. Requires such procedures to take account of geographic distribution and the needs of students and teachers from historically underrepresented groups. Authorizes each Center to: (1) support development and dissemination of innovative geography cirricula; (2) develop geography curricula to be used in other subject areas; and (3) provide technical and resource assistance in geography to schools in the region served. Raises from six to seven percent the maximum portion of funds for Federal, State, and Local Partnerships for Educational Improvement which the Secretary is to reserve for National Programs and Activities. Includes the National Geography Studies Centers among such National Programs and Activities, and requires that a specified minimum amount be made available for such Centers, subject to the availability of funds for any fiscal year for National Programs and Activities."
