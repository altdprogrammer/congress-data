    "text": "Title I: Short Title, Findings and Purposes - Nevada Federal Wilderness Act of 1988 - Sets forth the findings and purposes of this Act. Title II: Additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System - Designates the following lands in Nevada as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Mount Charleston Wilderness in the Toiyabe National Forest; (2) lands in the Humboldt National Forest which shall be incorporated in the Jarbidge Wilderness; (3) the Mount Moriah Wilderness in the Humboldt National Forest; (4) the Boundary Peak Wilderness in the Inyo National Forest; (5) the Mount Rose Wilderness in the Toiyabe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit which are within the Mount Rose National Recreation Area; and (6) the Sheep Peak Wilderness in the Desert National Wildlife Range. Title III: Mount Rose National Recreation Area - Establishes the Mount Rose National Recreation Area, Nevada. Prohibits the harvesting of timber in such area. Requires lands within the area designated as wilderness to remain roadless and be closed to motorized use, except for motorized equipment and transportation for fire suppression, search and rescue operations, and other emergencies. Requires off road vehicle use on lands in the area not designated as wilderness to be confined to trails and areas designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. Title IV: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management - Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final enivronmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nevada shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nevada which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas. Permits the expressly authorized use of motorized equipment for the maintenance of such livestock. States that this Act or any other Act designating lands within Nevada as wilderness areas does not constitute a reservation of water rights in such lands by Nevada. Retains rights to the roads located on such lands to Nevada. Does not preempt State jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in the national forests. Prohibits the establishment of protective perimeters or buffer zones around designated wilderness areas or the abrogation of the standards of the Clean Air Act. Declares that it is the intent of Congress that wilderness designation shall not in itself provide for protection under specified provisions of such Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to continue mineral, oil and gas, and geothermal assessments in such lands, permitting the use of motorized equipment and roads for such purposes. Continues access by Nevada and local municipalities for maintaining watershed facilities and for other health and safety concerns. Continues unaffected the Federal responsibility for predator control activities. Does not limit present or future activities of guides and outfitters inside designated wilderness areas. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate with the Secretary of the Interior and with Nevada to conduct a cultural resource management program for the protection of archeological sites within such areas. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within two years after enactment of this Act, to submit to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs a report with respect to such program. Authorizes and directs specified Federal, State, and local entities to fight wildfire in lands designated as wilderness areas in Nevada. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) inventory all lands within designated wilderness areas to identify those not owned by the Federal Government; and (2) seek, where such lands are privately owned, to acquire them. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit to the Congress, not later than six months after enactment of this Act, a report on the restrictions on access to federally designated wilderness areas by handicapped persons, the elderly, and disabled veterans."
