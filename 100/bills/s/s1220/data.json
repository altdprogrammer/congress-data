    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H.R. 5142) AIDS Federal Policy Act of 1988 - Title I: Counseling and Testing with Respect to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome - Amends the Public Health Service Act to create a new title on counseling and testing with respect to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a grant allotment for each State for each of FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to entities which are grantees under other specified provisions, have received appropriated funds as alternate blood testing sites, or are nonprofit hospitals. Requires the allotments and grants be used only for counseling individuals with respect to AIDS and testing individuals for infection with the etiologic agent for AIDS. Directs the Secretary, in making the grants, to give preference to applicants in geographic areas where in FY 1989, the number of additional cases of AIDS, or in FY 1990 and subsequent fiscal years, if sufficient and accurate data are available, the number of additional cases of infection with the etiologic agent constitutes one percent or greater of such cases in the United States. Prohibits the Secretary from making an allotment or grant unless the applicant agrees to ensure, in accordance with Federal law and with State and local law not superseded by Federal law, the confidentiality of information and records with respect to individuals counseled or tested. Requires a written, signed statement of informed consent by the individual to be tested, with special provisions relating to testing through the use of a pseudonym and anonymous testing. Requires grantees to provide counseling which includes coverage of specified points before testing, after a negative test result, and after a positive test result. Requires grantees, where appropriate, to provide opportunities for women, children, hemophiliacs, and emergency response employees to undergo counseling under conditions appropriate to their needs. Allows grantees to use the grant to provide counseling without testing. Requires applicants who regularly provide treatment for sexually transmitted diseases or for intravenous substance abuse and applicants who are family planning clinics or tuberculosis clinics to routinely test for infection with the etiologic agent for AIDS. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant to a State unless the State requires testing of each individual who is convicted of prostitution, a crime relating to sexual assault, or a crime relating to intravenous drug abuse. Requires the State to test certain individuals on entering the penal system and during the 30-day period preceeding their release. Requires the State to notify the individual before the test is performed. Requires, on request of a victim of a crime relating to sexual assault, that the victim be notified of the results of the testing. Allows the Secretary to make a grant to a State for each of the FY 1989 and 1990 if the State provides assurances that it will establish the requirements not later than October 1, 1990. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant to a State unless the State provides assurances that it will: (1) encourage individuals in the State receiving, after 1976, a transfusion of any blood product to undergo testing; and (2) inform the individuals of public health facilities in the area that offer testing. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant to a State unless the State requires that: (1) any entity carrying out testing confidentially report to the State public health officer information sufficient to perform statistical and epidemiological analyses of the incidence and demographic characteristics of cases of infection; and (2) the State public health officer, to the extent appropriate in the determination of the officer, carry out a program of contact tracing. Requires State grantees to establish a civil cause of action and a criminal penalty for knowing actions by an infected individual which exposes another individual to the etiologic agent through: (1) donation of blood, semen, breast milk, or an organ; (2) sexual activity; and (3) any behavior with intent to expose another individual. Provides for an exception where the person exposed gives prior consent to being exposed. Allows the Secretary to make a grant to a State for each of the FY 1989 and 1990 if the State provides assurances that it will establish the civil and criminal actions not later than October 1, 1990. Allows the State chief executive officer to certify, in lieu of enactment of any statute or issuance of any regulation, that the law of the State is in substantial compliance. Requires States, to the extent permitted under State law, to offer substantial opportunities for an individual to undergo counseling and testing anonymously and through the use of a pseudonym. Prohibits requiring testing as a condition of receiving other health services, unless the testing is medically indicated in the health services being sought. Requires States to make available to marriage license applicants the most recently available scientific data with respect to prevention of exposure to, and the transmission of, the etiologic agent. Requires States to make such information available to physicians and dentists, updating the information not less than once each six months. Requires that grantees who provided counseling and testing before receipt of these grants use the grants to increase the availability of counseling and testing. Provides for administration of the grant, including prohibiting: (1) imposing a charge on any individual seeking counseling or testing who is unable to pay the charge; and (2) expending more than ten percent of the grant for administartion. Sets forth a formula for determination of the amount of allotments for States. Authorizes the Secretary, on request of a grantee, to provide supplies, equipment, services, and detailed personnel in lieu of grant funds. Directs the Secretary, directly or through grants and contracts, to evaluate programs carried out with grants made under this Act for counseling and testing. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991, with 50 percent of any appropriations going to allotments and 50 percent going to grants. Requires all individuals receiving counseling under these provisions to be counseled about the harmful effects of promiscuous sexual activity and intravenous substance abuse, and the benefits of abstaining from such activities. Prohibits funds from being used to provide counseling that promotes or encourages, directly, homosexual or unsafe heterosexual sexual activity or intravenous substance abuse, but declares that this may not be construed to prohibit a counselor from providing the most current scientific knowledge to reduce the individual's risk of exposure to, or the transmission of, the etiologic agent, provided any informational materials used are not obscene. Creates another new part in the new subtitle established by this Act concerning confidentiality with respect to counseling and testing. Prohibits certain persons, without regard to whether such person receives Federal financial assistance, from disclosing identifying information with respect to a protected individual or a contact of such individual.

Authorizes a court of competent jurisdiction, with respect to the protected individual or contact involved, to: (1) order disclosure of identifying information to a State health officer in order to prevent a clear and imminent danger or transmission, by the individual or contact, of the etiologic agent; and (2) authorize the officer to disclose identifying information to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent such danger. Sets forth procedures, including in camera hearings, use of pseudonyms, and sealing of records. Provides for nonconsensual disclosures to victims of sexual assault. Authorizes physicians and counselors to make nonconsensual disclosures to spouses, sexual contacts, and people with whom the protected individual has shared a hypodermic needle, in certain circumstances.
