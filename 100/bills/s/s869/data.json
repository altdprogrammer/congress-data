    "text": "Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require the withholding of child support payments from the non-custodial parent's wages upon the issuance or modification of a child support order. (Currently, such withholding need not occur until one month of nonpayment has elapsed.) Directs States to establish binding guidelines for child support award amounts. (Currently, such guidelines need not be binding.) Creates a rebuttable presumption that the child support award resulting from the application of such guidelines in a judicial or administrative child support proceeding is correct. Requires States to review and update all child support orders at least once every two years to ensure that they continue to comply with child support award guidelines. Gives the Federal Parent Locator Service and State child support enforcement agencies access to all employment security information in the possession or control of existing data networks. Conditions a State's eligibility for payments under titles IV or XIX (Medicaid) of the Act on its compliance with federally prescribed child support enforcement procedures."
