Revises the statement of purpose under chapter 2. Declares the policy of the Congress that financial assistance under chapter 2 to State and local educational agencies shall be made for innovative programs or programs which expand services and activities, but not merely to provide for the continuing maintenance of services and activities previously financed under chapter 2. Prohibits any chapter 2 allotment to a State from being used after September 30, 1990, for the maintenance of services and activities previously assisted under chapter 2 for a period of three continuous years. Authorizes waivers of such prohibition under specified conditions. Extends the authorization of appropriations for chapter 2 through FY 1993. Revises provisions for the use of funds for basic skills instruction. Revises the statements of purpose relating to educational improvement and support services and to special projects."
