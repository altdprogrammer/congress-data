Prohibits the Federal Government from entering into any contract for insurance which provides for payment or reimbursement for abortion services. States that no institution receiving Federal financial assistance shall: (1) discriminate against any employee, applicant, or student on the basis of that person's opposition to abortion; or (2) require any employee or student to participate in abortion procedures. States that attorney's fees shall not be allowed in any civil action involving a law prohibiting or restricting abortions. Provides for Supreme Court review of lower court decisions which declare State and local anti-abortion statutes unconstitutional."
