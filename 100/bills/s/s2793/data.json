Prescribes criminal penalties for anyone who deprives or defrauds the inhabitants of the United States of the honest services of a public official. Prescribes criminal penalties for any official who, in order to carry out or conceal any scheme or artifice to defraud, discriminates, harasses, or takes adverse action against any employee or official of the United States or any State or political subdivision. Authorizes such an adversely affected employee or official to obtain relief through a civil action, provided such person did not participate in the scheme or artifice. Amends mail fraud provisions to: (1) include within the definition of a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" any scheme or artifice to deprive an organization of the intangible rights of honest services in which the defendant received or attempted to receive anything of value or in which the defendant intended loss or harm to the organization; and (2) prohibit use of any facility of interstate or foreign commerce in the execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud."
