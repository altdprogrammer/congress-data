Directs the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Federal Aviation Administration, to provide technical assistance to the Secretary of the Interior for such study. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress within two years after enactment of this Act regarding the study results. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to: (1) review, on the basis of aviation safety, current regulations pertaining to aircraft flights over units of the national park system addressed in the study conducted by the Secretary of the Interior; and (2) report to the Congress the results of such review together with recommendations for changes. Authorizes appropriations for such studies. Prohibits any fixed wing aircraft or helicopter from flying below specified minimum altitudes during such study and review periods over the surfaces of Yosemite National Park and Haleakala National Park. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a final plan for air traffic management and noise abatement over Grand Canyon National Park to the Administrator. Prescribes guidelines under which the Administrator is required to implement such plan. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress whether such final plan has succeeded in substantially restoring the natural quiet in the Grand Canyon National Park. Exempts certain helicopter flights of river runners from prohibition under the noise abatement plan."
