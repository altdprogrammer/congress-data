Requires applicants to: (1) file by February 28, 1987; and (2) agree to participate in the 1987 wheat program. Makes 1986 harvested hay and straw that was destroyed by flooding eligible for such assistance. Requires applicants to file by February 28, 1987. Limits: (1) total program assistance to $1,000,000; and (2) individual payments to $20,000. Amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to assure that agricultural producers are given sufficient time to rehabilitate damaged farmland under the emergency conservation program. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees: (1) by February 17, 1987, concerning the adjustment of loan rates for the 1986 crops of upland cotton, feed grains, and soybeans due to drought, flooding and other problems in 1986; and (2) by April 1, 1987, concerning 1986 quality losses for program crops and freeze-losses, with special emphasis on tree crops."
