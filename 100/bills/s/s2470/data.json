    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an industrial energy conservation and competitive technology program to conduct scientific research and development to enhance the energy efficiency and competitiveness of American steel, aluminum, and copper, and other metals industries through public-private sector partnerships. Directs the Secretary to publish an update of: (1) the Steel Management Plan issued by the Department of Energy on April 1, 1987, to include aluminum within the initiative; and (2) the Steel Initiative Research Plan issued by the Department of Energy in April 1988 to enumerate priorities with respect to steel, aluminum, copper, and other metals research and development activities. Requires the Steel Management Plan to assure basic research support from independent non-Federal sources by coordinating plan activities with research efforts of various other Department of Energy programs. Provides for protection of proprietary rights in connection with projects and for coordination of research and development within the Department of Energy. Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly the National Bureau of Standards), through its Institute for Materials Science and Engineering and in coordination with the Department of Energy, to conduct an expanded program of steel and aluminum research in support of activities conducted under the plan. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the President and to the Congress on research and development activities carried out under this Act. Authorizes FY 1989 through 1991 appropriations. Prohibits any Federal entity from obligating or spending any federally received funds unless it has in place and will administer a written policy to ensure a workplace that is free of controlled substances. Imposes a corresponding prohibition on secondary recipients of Federal funds in connection with grants, contracts, and other agreements."
