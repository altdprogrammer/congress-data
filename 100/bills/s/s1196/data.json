Expands coverage of such Act to include Great Lakes resources. (Current law covers ocean and coastal resources.) Requires the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Administrator) to develop and publish every three years the Sea Grant Strategic Research Plan (Plan) identifying and describing a limited number of priority areas for strategic marine research. Requires the Plan to be submitted to specified congressional committees. Describes the priority area on which the Plan shall concentrate, including: (1) critical resource and environmental areas of national or global scope where adequate funding is otherwise precluded under other provisions of the National Sea Grant College Program Act; and (2) areas where sustained programmatic research and technology transfer can be utilized. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to make grants to carry out such strategic marine research to sea grant colleges, programs, regional consortia, and individuals meeting certain criteria. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for FY 1988 through 1992. Describes the academic, congressional, Federal, and postdoctoral fellowships which may be awarded. Adds to the duties of the sea grant review panel the responsibility of giving advice with respect to applications, proposals, performance, grants, and contracts awarded under the Sea Grant Strategic Research Plan. Authorizes appropriations for the National Sea Grant College Program for FY 1988 through 1992. Amends provisions of the Sea Grant Program Improvement Act of 1976 relating to the purposes of the Sea Grant International program to authorize grants and contracts to enhance international research, promote marine activities with foreign universities, encourage technology transfer, and promote foreign data exchanges. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for FY 1988 through 1992. Allows additional funding to be provided through other Federal program elements with a marine science or technology transfer component, or both."
