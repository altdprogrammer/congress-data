    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of 1988 - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to revise the policies governing Federal energy management. Requires agencies to improve construction designs for Federal buildings so that the energy consumption per gross square foot in use during FY 1995 is at least ten percent less than that of FY 1985. Sets forth implementation steps to meet such goal. Exempts from such requirement buildings in which energy intensive activities are implemented. Redescribes procedures involved in the establishment and use of life cycle cost methods for Federal buildings. Requires the establishment by each agency of an incentives program using internal resources to encourage energy conservation and efficiency by allowing the retention of a portion of the dollar savings resulting from the agency's energy conservation measures. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an Interagency Energy Management Task Force to coordinate Federal energy savings and disseminate information on energy efficiency. Requires each agency to report at least annually to the Secretary regarding its energy conservation activities and related contracts. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress regarding energy conservation progress and contracts relating to Federal buildings. Requires the Secretary, to carry out an energy survey to: (1) determine the potential maximum cost effective energy peak demand savings achievable in a limited representative sample of federally-owned or leased buildings; and (2) recommend cost effective energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in such buildings. Prescribes implementation procedures. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress and the affected agencies regarding the survey findings and conclusions. Authorizes appropriations. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transfer, or receive any toy or imitation firearm which does not have a marking approved by the Secretary of Commerce. Requires each such toy or imitation firearm to have a blaze orange plug inserted in its barrel as a permanently fixed and integral part. Provides for alternate marking and exceptions in certain instances. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics to study and report on the criminal misuse of toy, look-alike and imitation firearms, including police reports regarding incidents relative to marked and unmarked firearms. Directs the Director of the National Institute of Justice to conduct a technical evaluation of the marking systems for toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms to determine their effectiveness in police combat situations. Declares that these firearms provisions supersede any State or local laws dealing with firearms marking or identification. Prohibits States from banning the sale of antique firearms replicas and pellet-firing airguns. Exempts such artifacts from the prohibitions of this Act."
