Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size and other specified areas. Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas, subject to mandatory review by the Secretary of Agriculture.
