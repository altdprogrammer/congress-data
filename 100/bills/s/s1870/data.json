Declares such funds to be held in trust by the United States. Requires such funds to be invested by the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of such Indian tribe. Makes such funds available to the governing body of the tribe, on a budgetary basis and subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, for tribal, social, and economic development programs for the tribe. Exempts such trust funds, and funds made available under this Act for programs or for distributions under any programs, from Federal, State, or local income taxes. Precludes such funds (or their availability) from being considered as income or resources, or otherwise utilized as the basis for denying or reducing the financial assistance or other benefits to which any household or individual would otherwise be entitled under the Social Security Act or, except for per capita payments in excess of $2,000, any other Federal or federally assisted program."
