Authorizes the imposition of permit fees which, after recovering permit issuance costs and costs incurred by the Secretary as the direct result of permitted activities, provide the Federal Government with a reasonable return. Authorizes the use of collected fees for the permit program, and for designating and managing sanctuaries. Imposes penalties for the violation of permit provisions. Directs each permittee to submit an annual report to the Secretary which describes activities conducted pursuant to such permit and revenues derived from such activities during the year. Excludes fishing from this Act's permit process. Subjects anyone who destroys, causes the loss of, or injures any sanctuary resource to liability to the Federal Government for response costs and damages resulting from such destruction, loss, or injury. Subjects vessels to liability in rem for such costs or damages. Sets forth defenses to such liability. Directs the Secretary to pursue civil actions against persons or vessels who may be liable for such costs or damages. Requires the Secretary to retain recovered amounts for sanctuary restoration, management, and improvement. Authorizes specified enforcement actions against title III violators, including: (1) the imposition of a civil penalty of up to $50,000 for each day a person is guilty of a violation; (2) the forfeiture of any vessel other item used, and any sanctuary resource taken or retained in connection with or as a result of a violation; and (3) injunctive relief. Sets forth dates by which the Secretary must issue a designation notice regarding the proposed Cordell Banks, Flower Garden Banks, Monterey Bay, and Western Washington Outer Coast National Marine Sanctuaries. Requires the Secretary to submit a prospectus to specified congressional committees by March 31, 1991, regarding the Northern Puget Sound National Marine Sanctuary, and by September 30, 1990, regarding Stellwagen Bank. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to determine whether all or any part of the Santa Monica Bay area should be designated as a national marine sanctuary. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding such study within two years of this Act's enactment and commence the designation process with respect to the area or any part of it if it or any part of it is found to be appropriate for designation."
