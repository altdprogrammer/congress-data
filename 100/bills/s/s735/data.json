Requires that 50 percent of such revenues go to the State in which the refuge is located, 25 percent to a special account in the Fund, and 25 percent to the U.S. Treasury. Requires Federal agencies eligible to receive Fund revenues to provide both Appropriations Committees with a priority list of land acquisition projects which the Committees shall finance out of the special account. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to distribute such monies according to a formula, if the Congress fails to act."
