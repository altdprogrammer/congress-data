Requires the Secretary of Defense, in determining the purposes for which such transfer authority will be used, to: (1) ensure that an appropriate portion of such authority is used to transfer to operation and maintenance accounts of DOD for FY 1988 funds for depot maintenance activities sufficient to reduce service backlogs and funds for pay of civilian personnel of DOD in an amount sufficient to ensure that no such employees are released due to insufficient funding; (2) give special consideration and priority to DOD civilian employees, defense readiness, and more efficient acquisition processes; and (3) provide funds for other high-priority readiness items."
