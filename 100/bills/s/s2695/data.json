Requires the initial payment of an annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System to be made: (1) in the case of immediate retirement or early retirement, not more than 75 days after the date on which the employee is separated from service; or (2) in the case of deferred retirement, not more than 45 days after the date on which OPM receives a completed application from the individual.
