Repeals provisions which allow for an assessment of Federal agencies for contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund for the purchase of insurance to cover potential liability of persons who serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to such Fund. Requires repayment of agency contributions to the Fund which are not spent or obligated for the purchase of fiduciary liability insurance."
