    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendment, S. Rept. 100-545) Anti-Apartheid Act Amendments of 1988 - Title I: Sanctions Against Investment In, And Exports To, South Africa And Other Measures (Except Import Restrictions) To End Apartheid - Amends the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 to prohibit any investments in South Africa by U.S. persons. Makes exceptions to such prohibition for: (1) any investment in a business enterprise 90 percent owned by and controlled by South Africans economically and politically disadvantaged by apartheid; and (2) investments made by certain individuals during any period and to the extent that such investments are considered South Africian emigrant non-resident assets and subject to restrictions on their transfer or disposition. Authorizes a person to apply for, and the President to grant for good cause, a waiver of such prohibition for up to 180 days. Prohibits the exportation or reexportation to South Africa of any goods or technology subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Prohibits any such exportation or reexportation by any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Exempts from such prohibition publications, donations of food, clothing and medical supplies, commercial sales of agricultural commodities and products, and goods and technology for use in the gathering or dissemination of information by news media organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Specifies that such prohibitions shall not apply to: (1) any goods that are the direct product of technology of U.S. origin under a written agreement entered into on or before April 20, 1988, and that are exported within one year of the enactment of this Act; (2) economic assistance or human rights programs for disadvantaged South Africans, South African blacks or other nonwhite South Africans, or victims of apartheid in South Africa; and (3) contributions to charitable organizations engaged in social welfare, public health, religious, educational, and emergency relief activities in South Africa. Repeals specified provisions of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 prohibiting certain exports to, imports from, and investments in South Africa. Revises the definition of \"loans\" for purposes of such Act to prohibit short-term trade financing and sales on open account. Adds other definitions for purposes of such Act. Requires U.S. controlled South African entities that are subject to the investment prohibition and that employ more than 24 South Africans to notify employees and employee organizations not less than 90 days prior to termination of the U.S. investment in such entity and to enter into good faith negotiations with respresentative trade unions regarding the terms of such termination.
