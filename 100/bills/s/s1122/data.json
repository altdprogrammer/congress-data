Authorizes the House or Senate agricultural committees also to request such investigation. Directs the Secretary, upon such findings, to: (1) notify the Congress; and (2) prohibit such country from exporting meat to the United States the Secretary certifies that such meat has met applicable U.S. domestic inspection standards."
