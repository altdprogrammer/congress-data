Rept. 100-166) High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act of 1987 - Establishes a Risk Assessment Board (the Board), within the Department of Health and Human Services, to: (1) review pertinent medical and scientific reports on the incidence of disease associated with exposure to occupational health hazards; (2) identify and designate those populations at risk of such disease that should receive notification; (3) develop a form and method of notification that will be used by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary); and (4) determine the appropriate type of medical monitoring or beneficial health counseling. Sets forth factors which the Board must consider in identifying and designating such populations at risk. Sets forth procedures for notice of proposed determinations. Directs the Board, in making determinations, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and health (NIOSH), in giving or coordinating notification, to notify as many employees at risk of disease as appropriations and the best available scientific evidence permit.
