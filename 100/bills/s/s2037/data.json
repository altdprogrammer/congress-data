    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1988-04-26", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act - Amends the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to increase the authorized appropriations to the Administrator of General Services to provide services and facilities to: (1) the President-elect and Vice President-elect in connection with the preparation of their assumption of official duties; and (2) the former President and former Vice President in connection with winding up their affairs. Limits the amount that may be appropriated for the reimbursement of a national party committee for transition planning expenses. Requires the President to include a proposed appropriation for carrying out this Act in the budget for each fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the term of office of such President expires. Requires amounts authorized for presidential transition costs to be increased by an inflation adjusted amount to reflect the actual increases in such costs since the previous presidential transition. Authorizes the Administrator to provide reimbursement of pre-election transition planning expenses and other transition expenses to each national party committee of a major party candidate for President. Requires the national party committees to disclose to the Administrator all private money received for transition planning. Requires the President-elect and the Vice President-elect to disclose to the Administrator all private money received for use in their preparation for the assumption of official duties. Requires the Administrator to make such disclosures public. Requires the President-elect and the Vice President-elect to disclose to the public a list of the names of all transition personnel and the most recent employment and source of funding which support the transition activities of such personnel. Requires public disclosures to be made in the form of three reports to the Administrator after the date of the general election. Authorizes the use of Government aircraft for transition purposes, on a reimbursable basis, if requested by the President-elect or the Vice President-elect, or their designee, and approved by the President. Provides that when the President-elect or the Vice President-elect request the use of a chartered aircraft, any collections received from persons occupying space on such aircraft shall be deposited to the credit of appropriations for presidential transitions. Sets forth a time schedule for the expenditure of funds provided for presidential transitions. Requires the national party committees to provide an estimate to the Administrator of the aggregate value of in-kind contributions made between the enactment of this Act and November 9, 1988, which were received for transition planning purposes for: (1) transportation; (2) hotel and other accommodations; (3) office space; and (4) furniture, furnishings, office machines and equipment and office supplies. Requires the President-elect and the Vice President-elect to provide such an estimate for transition activities to the Administrator for the period from November 9, 1988, through January 20, 1989. Makes the appropriation inflation adjustment provision of this Act inapplicable to the FY 1989 budget. Authorizes the payment of certain transportation expenses for any individual performing presidential transition activities. Authorizes the President to fill executive agency vacancies for not more than 120 days (under current law, not more than 30 days), unless a nomination to fill such vacancy has been submitted to the Senate. Declares that if such nomination has been made, the designated person may serve: (1) until the Senate confirms the nomination; (2) for not more than 30 days after the Senate rejects the nomination; or (3) if designated when the Congress has adjourned sine die, for no more than 120 days after the Congress next convenes."
