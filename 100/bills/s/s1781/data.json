Applies this provision when: (1) the contribution is a debt instrument in connection with a loan to a country eligible for World Bank or International Development Association financing; (2) the donation is made to a governmental unit or to a tax-exempt charitable, religious, literary, scientific, or educational entity (a 501(c)(3) organization); and (3) the instrument or its proceeds will be used for one or more international conservation purposes, such as preservation of open spaces, protection of natural habitat, support of conservation education programs, and appropriate research and experimentation."
