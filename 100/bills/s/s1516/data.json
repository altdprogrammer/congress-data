Title XIV: Administrative Procedure - Permits a private right of action for judicial review of an EPA regulation. Title XV: Imports and Exports - Prohibits the export of restricted use or unregistered pesticides until the EPA receives specified information regarding such pesticides and their exportation and the importer is notified of the reasons why such pesticides were restricted or denied registration in this country. Prohibits the export of such pesticides to countries which are not on a list, maintained by EPA, of countries which have mechanisms to ensure their safe and effective use. Requires EPA to: (1) notify foreign governments and appropriate international agencies of pesticide regulatory activities; (2) participate in international pesticide research and regulatory programs; (3) provide foreign governments with technical assistance in developing pesticide regulatory programs; (4) survey countries that import U.S. pesticides or export agricultural products to the United States to ascertain existing pesticide regulations and control food residues; and (5) sponsor meetings to encourage members of the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to adopt a binding multilateral convention containing regulations for exported pesticides at least as stringent as these in this Act. Title XVI: Disposal and Transportation - Authorizes the EPA to: (1) require registrants to provide information concerning the safe storage and disposal of excess or spilled pesticides and their ability to carry out recall plans; (2) impose requirements and procedures on persons who store, transport, or dispose of a cancelled or suspended pesticide or materials used to contain or collect excess or spilled quantities of such pesticide; and (3) recall a pesticide when necessary for the protection of health or the environment.

Gives States 90 days after being notified by EPA that such level has been surpassed to take action to prevent potential adverse effects on human health or the environment before EPA takes action to prevent such effects. Directs EPA, with the assistance of a council of information management experts, to develop a site-specific pesticide information management system to assist State and local officials and users to prevent groundwater contamination by pesticides.
