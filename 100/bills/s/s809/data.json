Transfers all Task Force functions to the Council and terminates the Task Force. Sets forth Council functions, including: (1) Federal homeless program review; (2) governmental and private programs evaluation; (3) information distribution; and (4) provision of professional and technical assistance. Requires each Federal agency to report annually (the first report due within 90 days of enactment of this Act) to the Congress and the Council regarding its programs for the homeless, any impediments including statutory or regulatory restrictions affecting such programs, and efforts made to increase food, shelter, and support opportunities for the homeless. Requires the Council to report annually to the President and to the Congress regarding: (1) the nature and extent of the homeless problem; (2) Council activities in cooperation with governmental and private entities; (3) Federal programs for the homeless, and an assessment of necessary levels of Federal assistance; and (4) appropriate recommendations. Authorizes FY 1987 and 1988 appropriations. Title II: Clarification of Use of Excess Property Under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 - Excess Property Identification Act of 1987 - Requires: (1) each Federal agency to identify excess property under its control that would be suitable for use as a shelter or to provide services to the homeless; and (2) the Administrator of General Services to report to the Council on the availability of such property. Title III: Shelter Program - Part A: General Provisions - Emergency Food and Shelter Act of 1987 - Establishes the Emergency Food and Shelter Program National Board, to be constituted by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Directs FEMA to act as Federal liaison and provide support services to the Board. States that each Board-designated locality shall constitute a local board for purposes of determining fund distributions. Sets forth local board responsibilities, including: (1) coordination with other governmental assistance programs; (2) selection of grant recipients; and (3) program monitoring. Sets forth Board recordkeeping and audit provisions, including authority for access by the Comptroller General of the United States. Requires the Board to report annually to the Congress. Part B: Emergency Food and Shelter Grants - Requires the Director of FEMA, within 30 days of enactment of a law providing appropriations to carry out this part, to provide funds to the Board for grants to private nonprofit organizations and units of local government to: (1) provide shelter, food, and support services to the homeless, with attention given to homeless persons with mental and physical disabilities; (2) strengthen efforts to create more effective and innovative local programs; and (3) conduct limited rehabilitation of existing mass shelter or mass feeding facilities. Limits Board funding to only those programs carried out by nonprofit organizations and units of local government which are consistent with the purposes of this title. Prohibits the Board from carrying out programs directly. Limits administrative costs to not more than five percent of total appropriations. Requires the Board to establish written guidelines, including: (1) methods for identifying needy localities, and determining allocations; (2) eligible program costs; and (3) guidelines specifying the responsibilities and reporting requirements of the Board, its recipients and service providers. Authorizes FY 1987 appropriations, including any amount provided under Public Law 100-6 (additional funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency). Part C: Case Management - Requires the Director of FEMA, within 30 days of enactment of a law providing appropriations to carry out this part, to provide grants to the Board to be given to recipient private nonprofit organizations and units of local government under part B of this Act to provide the homeless in shelters with case management services. Requires recipients to provide or arrange for such services. Sets forth required services. States that, if feasible in certain areas, the government or private entity operating a homeless shelter shall give preference to specified Community Services Block Grant programs in arranging for the provision of case management services. Authorizes FY 1987 and 1988 appropriations. Title IV: Housing Assistance - Requires a State or urban area to submit a comprehensive homeless assistance plan for approval to the Interagency Council on the Homeless in order to receive housing assistance under this Act. Sets forth required contents of such plan, including a description of the local homeless population and the existing services available to them. Requires the Council to review and approve a plan within 30 days unless such plan fails to meet the requirements of this Act. Requires: (1) annual performance monitoring reports to the Council; and (2) the Council to carry out performance evaluations beginning with FY 1990. Authorizes additional FY 1987 and 1988 appropriations for: (1) the transitional housing program; and (2) the emergency shelter grant program. Increases the minimum allocation amounts for the emergency shelter grants program. Exempts such additional emergency shelter assistance from a specified planning requirement. Increases available budget authority for five-year contract section 8 existing housing certificates for the homeless, especially the elderly and homeless families with children. Permits such certificates to be attached to a housing unit owned by a nonprofit organization which has agreed to provide shelter and services to the homeless. Increases available budget authority for ten-year contract section 8 single room occupancy dwellings for the homeless. Requires the installation of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and other fire and safety improvements. Limits rehabilitation costs to $14,000 per unit, unless local conditions such as contruction or acquisition costs or fire or building codes require increases.
