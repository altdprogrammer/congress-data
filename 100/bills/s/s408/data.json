    "text": "Nuclear Emergency Preparedness Act of 1987 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from granting an operating license to any applicant authorizing operation at a greater power level than that which was authorized on January 1, 1987, unless: (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has reviewed and found adequate emergency plans which have been prepared by each State in consultation with the local governments which lie within the emergency planning zone and which have been submitted for a zone at least ten miles in radius; (2) the NRC determines that the State plans comply with federally prescribed standards and provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency; and (3) the Chief Executive Officer of each State submitting such a plan has approved in writing the final emergency plan. Prohibits the NRC from reducing the existing emergency planning zone for a nuclear power reactor which was issued an operating license before January 1, 1987. Mandates that the standards of the NRC and the FEMA for off-site and onsite emergency response plans for nuclear power reactors shall be at least as protective of public health and safety as those which are in effect as of January 1, 1987."
