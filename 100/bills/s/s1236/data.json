    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #412 (298-120)) Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Amendments of 1988 - Reauthorizes housing relocation under the Navajo Hopi Relocation Program. Increases the authorization of appropriations for incentive bonuses for voluntary relocations. Extends and increases the annual authorization for relocation housing. Deletes the matching fund restrictions and other restrictions on the use of the discretionary account of the Commissioner on Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation. Establishes, in place of the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation as an independent entity in the executive branch. Requires the Commissioner to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate for a two-year term. Restricts legal services contracts entered into by the Office to appropriated funds and limits the authorization for this purpose to $100,000 per fiscal year. Authorizes the Commissioner to call upon other Federal agencies for assistance in implementing the relocation plan. Requires that failures to provide assistance be reported to the Congress. Requires the Commissioner to submit a report, within six months after the Commissioner is confirmed, on: (1) the members of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes who reside within partitioned lands; (2) members who are eligible for but who have not received their relocation benefits; (3) fair market value of partitioned land residences; and (4) how the Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund will be spent for the economic, educational, and social needs of Navajo families and communities directly and substantially affected. Prohibits lobbying on issues relating to relocations by any entity which has a contract with the Commissioner, with tribal exceptions. Sets forth procedures for considering requests for new development of certain lands under litigation. Allows construction to improve and repair existing structures without the consent of the Navajo or Hopi Tribes if it is necessary for the health or safety of the Tribes or a member of either Tribe. Establishes the Navajo Rehabilitation Trust Fund to be used to benefit Navajo families and communities affected by the relocations, the decision in the Healing case, and the establishment of a certain grazing district for the exclusive use of the Hopi Tribe. Terminates the fund when, upon petition by the Navajo Tribe, the Secretary of the Interior determines its goals have been met and the United States has been reimbursed. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1995. Provides that acquired lands shall be available to all Navajo families, not only those awaiting relocation. Provides that the sole authority for final development planning decisions rests with the Commissioner until his statutory responsibility has been discharged. Authorizes payment of certain legal fees of the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, pending a decision on tribal recognition by the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes appropriations. Provides that appeals from eligibility determinations of the Relocation Commission shall be brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona."
