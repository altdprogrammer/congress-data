    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring air carrier aircraft manufactured after January 1, 1990, to be equipped with crash-resistant inner fuel tanks and breakaway, self-sealing fittings throughout the fuel system or other devices or means which will prevent the spraying or free flow of fuel after an air crash. Mandates that aircraft manufactured on or before such date be retrofitted to reduce the incidence of fire or explosion. Requires the Secretary to implement a research and development program to achieve a reduction in rapid fuel dispersal and combustibility in connection with an air crash. Authorizes appropriations."
