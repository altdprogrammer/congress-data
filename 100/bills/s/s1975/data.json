    "text": "Comprehensive Federal Law Enforcement Improvements Act of 1987 - Title I: Special Improvements - Allows Federal agencies to provide travel and transportation expenses to newly appointed law enforcement officers. Authorizes investigators of the Offices of Inspector General to: (1) conduct investigations concerning any violation of U.S. law relating to the programs, personnel, or operation of a Federal department, agency, or administration; (2) obtain and serve subpoenas and summonses; (3) obtain and execute search and arrest warrants; (4) carry firearms; and (5) make lawful warrantless arrests. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to increase the basic level of public safety officer death benefits. Removes the requirement that parent beneficiaries be dependents of the deceased officer. Authorizes the Comptroller General to assign General Accounting Office (GAO) employees special investigative duties with respect to Federal programs and activities. Grants the Comptroller General subpoena power in such investigations. Provides increased criminal penalties for assaulting certain GAO personnel. Provides criminal penalties for obstructing GAO audits or investigations. Amends the Federal Torts Claim Act to include GAO investigators within the definition of \"investigative or law enforcement officer.\" Title II: National Advisory Commission on Law Enforcement - Establishes the National Advisory Commission on Law Enforcement to study the methods and rates of compensation of law enforcement officers. Requires the Commission to report the results of such study to the President and the Congress within six months of enactment of this Act. Terminates the Commission upon adjournment of the 100th Congress."
