Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, following the completion of a contract under provisions for data continuity after the Landsat system, and upon 30 days' advance notice to specified congressional committees, to dispose of any Government assets (other than real property) so as to ensure continuation of the contractor's commercial activity. Revises provisions concerning the use of experimental data from Federal research and development programs. Adds provisions relating to the use of non-Federal data from the research and development activities of system operators or marketing entities. Authorizes system operators to require that unenhanced data not be reproduced or disseminated by a foreign or domestic purchaser."
