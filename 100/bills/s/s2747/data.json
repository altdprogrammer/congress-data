States that sovereign immunity is not a defense to such an action. Allows aggrieved individuals, after exhaustion of tribal remedies, or the Attorney General to initiate actions against an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or tribal official. Requires the Federal district court to adopt the findings of fact of the tribal court, absent specified determinations. Requires the Federal court to give deference to the interpretations of the tribal court on questions of tribal law."
