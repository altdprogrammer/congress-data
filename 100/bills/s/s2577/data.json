    "text": "Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to exclude from OASDI coverage cash wages paid to hand harvest laborers who: (1) are paid on a piece rate basis; (2) are paid less than $150 per year by their employer for such labor; (3) commute daily from their permanent residence; and (4) were employed in agriculture less than 13 weeks in the preceding calendar year. (Currently, such wages are excluded if the agricultural laborer is paid less than $150 per year or the employer spends $2,500 or more on labor for the year.) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit the imposition of social security taxes on such wages."
