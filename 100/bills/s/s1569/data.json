    "text": "High Level Waste Repository Water Pollution Control and Guarantee Act - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to grant congressional consent to an interstate compact which provides that: (1) if water in any State is polluted by leakage from a high level nuclear waste repository, every State signatory (whether or not it generates nuclear waste) shall provide a pro rata share of its water resources to fully replace the lost water resources; (2) if residential, commercial, or agricultural land becomes effectively unusable due to high level waste leakage, each State signatory shall provide equivalent land on a pro rata basis; and (3) each State signatory agrees to designate a member to, and comply with the orders of, the Polluted High Level Waste Repository Water State Compensation Commission (established by this Act). Establishes such Commission and makes it responsible for allocating land and water pursuant to this Act. Prohibits the shipment of high level radioactive waste to any repository authorized under this Act unless: (1) the compact is consented to by at least 40 States; and (2) the State in which such waste originated is a signatory to such compact. Provides a Federal guarantee that: (1) any land pollution loss that is not fully compensated under this Act shall be compensated at full value by the United States; and (2) any physical facilities needed for replacement water transportation shall be immediately constructed by the United States upon a determination of need for such facility by the Commission."
