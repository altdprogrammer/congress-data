    "text": "Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to state that the dairy export incentive program and the export sales of dairy products program shall not be operated in a way that will reduce the dairy products available for the temporary emergency food assistance program (TEFAP) or any other domestic feeding program. Extends TEFAP, including storage and distribution authorizations, through FY 1991. Increases the amount of TEFAP funds for emergency feeding organizations. Extends through FY 1991 the Secretary of Agriculture's responsibility to publish a notice of anticipated available commodities in the Federal Register. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend through FY 1991: (1) the dairy export incentive program; and (2) the export sales of dairy products program. Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to direct the Secretary to establish procedures for State, local, or private donations to supplement Federal food assistance programs. Authorizes States or emergency feeding organizations to use funds appropriated under this Act for facilities use and distribution costs. Authorizes States to use such funds to conduct an information program regarding available food assistance programs, including the food stamp program and the special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children. Directs State and local agencies to continue to use volunteer workers and donated food stuffs in food distribution programs."
