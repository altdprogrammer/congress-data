    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1987-04-09", 
    "text": "Special Pay and Civil Service Improvements Act of 1987 - Title I: Special Pay Authority - Authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, upon finding that recruitment or retention of well-qualified individuals for agency positions is or is likely to become significantly handicapped because of certain conditions, to establish higher minimum rates of pay for such positions. Prohibits such rates from exceeding level V of the Executive Schedule. Describes conditions which may require higher minimum rates of pay as: (1) rates of pay paid Federal Government employees of an agency are lower than the rates of pay paid such employees in similar positions in the same agency or other agencies; (2) rates of pay paid Federal employees are lower than the rates of pay paid employees of non-Federal Government employers in similar positions; (3) undesirable working conditions; or (4) positions in a remote geographic location. Authorizes the head of an agency to request the Director to establish higher rates of pay for any position for a period not to exceed two years. Requires the Director to respond to such request within 45 days after the date the agency transmits such request. Authorizes the Director to: (1) review annually any agency's special pay program; and (2) to make a written determination if such program is no longer necessary. Provides for reverting a position from higher special pay to the General Schedule. Declares that the pay of any person in a special pay position shall not be reduced because of the termination of the application of such higher rate of pay. Provides for increasing special rates in accordance with increases in the General Schedule. Provides with respect to special pay employees for: (1) periodic step increases; (2) bonus payments; (3) advance pay; and (4) travel and transportation expenses. Authorizes agency heads to make selections and appointments on an expedited basis for special pay positions. Requires a special pay employee who receives training of at least four weeks to enter into an agreement with the Government to continue in the service of the agency for a certain period of time after such training. Requires any such employee who separates from the agency prior to the agreement to reimburse the Government for expenses incurred in connection with the training. Eliminates the GS-11 grade requirement for paying new employees above the minimum rate of the appropriate grade. Requires the Director to provide for parity in the pay of: (1) law enforcement personnel in similar positions; and (2) health care personnel serving in positions similar to those of health care personnel of the Veterans Administration. Directs the Comptroller General to monitor the implementation of this Act and to report to the Congress annually on findings. Title II: Miscellaneous Civil Service Amendments - Authorizes Federal employees who participate in the Executive Exchange Program to earn retirement credit during such participation. Provides that the number of days that a Senior Executive Service appointee is detailed to a position other than the one to which the appointee is assigned shall not be counted if such detail occurs within 120 days of the initial assignment. Prohibits the classification of a Senior Executive Service position at a particular pay level. Permits such personnel to receive performance awards and rank awards for the same performance periods. Provides travel and transportation expenses for such personnel upon their separation from service. Requires the Director to prescribe the allowance to be paid employees stationed at remote work sites. (Currently, such allowance is limited to $10 per day). Increases the uniform allowance limit and provides for further increases based on the consumer price index. Authorizes the use of compensatory time by prevailing rate (blue collar) employees. Title III: Federal Employees Health Benefits - Repeals the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act effective 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Entitles any person enrolled in a health benefits plan pursuant to the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act to enroll in any Federal employee health benefit plan. Requires the automatic enrollment in an indemnity benefit plan of any retiree who does not decide upon a health plan during the open enrollment period. Sets forth administrative requirements of the Director resulting from such repeal. Provides an enrollment period for certain retirees who are not enrolled in a health benefits plan on the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes a person who is entitled to a deferred annuity and who is covered under a self and family plan to enroll in a self only plan if such other annuitant or employee changes such coverage to self only. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to make information available to employees and annuitants so that such individuals can make an informed enrollment choice. Requires health carriers to provide information on the time required to process claims and issue claim payments and the justification for determining usual, customary, or reasonable charges. Requires the Director to report to the Congress on the feasibility of providing an enrollment category for self and spouse only. Provides for sequential payments of health benefits for annuitants covered under more than one Federal health benefit plan. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on ways to maintain the long-term value of survivor annuities."
