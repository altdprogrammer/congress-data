Requires States, in order to receive basic grants under this Act, to provide: (1) an expedited driver's license suspension or revocation system; and (2) a self-sustaining drunk driving enforcement program. Sets forth additional requirements for the receipt of supplemental grants, which include: (1) providing for mandatory blood alcohol content testing whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a driver involved in a collision that results in a death or serious bodily injury has committed an alcohol-related traffic offense; (2) providing for an effective system for preventing drivers under the age of 21 from obtaining alcoholic beverages; or (3) providing for suspension of the registration of, and the return to the State of the license plates for, any motor vehicle owned by an individual convicted of more than one alcohol-related traffic offense or of driving with a license suspended or revoked because of an alcohol-related offense. Provides that no State may receive grants for more than three fiscal years. Sets forth the Federal share payable for such grants for each of the three fiscal years. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study to determine the blood alcohol concentration level at or above which an individual is deemed to be driving while under the influence; and (2) issue and publish proposed and final regulations to implement this Act."
