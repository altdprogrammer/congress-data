Specifies such sanctions as: (1) the termination, withdrawal, or suspension of any portion of any trade agreement or treaty that relates to the provision of nondiscriminatory (most-favored-nation) trade treatment to such country; (2) the denial of nondiscriminatory (most-favored-nation) trade treatment by the United States; (3) the nonapplication of the Generalized System of Preferences with respect to the products of such country; (4) the nonapplication of the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act with respect to the products of such country; and (5) the nonapplication of the provisions of the International Travel and Tourism Act of 1961 instructing the Secretary of Commerce to consult with other nations regarding international travel and tourism. Authorizes the President to waive any or all of such sanctions with respect to any foreign country if the President determines that such a waiver would be in the best interests of the United States."
