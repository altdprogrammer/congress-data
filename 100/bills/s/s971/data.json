Sets the rate of such tax as the difference between $24 per barrel ($26.50 for petroleum and petrochemical products) and the most recently published average price of a barrel of internationally traded oil, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with a specified formula. Permits an income tax deduction for oil import tax payments. Repeals the windfall profit tax on domestic crude oil."
