    "text": "Public Health Service Amendments Act of 1987 - Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to emergency medical services for children to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States, public and nonprofit private entities, and academic institutions for the development, establishment, and operation of regional centers for pediatric emergency medical services. Requires such centers to: (1) train health professionals; (2) provide for the appropriate use of bilingual personnel; (3) conduct research on prevention and treatment; and (4) conduct activities relating to prevention, including dissemination of information to the public. Directs the Secretary to make a grant for FY 1988 for a feasibility study on establishing and operating a National Center for Pediatric Emergency Medical Services (National Center). Directs the Secretary to request the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to submit an application for the grant and, if the Institute submits an acceptable application, to make the grant to the Institute. Directs the Secretary, in the absence of an acceptable application from the Institute, to request an application from one or more nonprofit private entities and to make the grant to the entity submitting the best acceptable application. Directs the Secretary, after reviewing the report prepared under such grant and consulting with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Emergency Physicians, if a National Center is feasible, to make grants for FY 1989 and each succeeding fiscal year for the establishment and operation of a National Center. Requires the National Center, with regard to pediatric medical emergencies, to: (1) develop and disseminate standards and quality assurance mechanisms; (2) facilitate training of health professionals; and (3) develop and disseminate to the public information on the prevention of, and responses to, such emergencies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) remove certain restrictions on the authority of the Secretary to make grants to and contracts with health professions schools related to geriatric medicine and care; (2) expand the authority of the Secretary to make grants and contracts for geriatric medicine training projects to include podiatrists as well as physicians and dentists; (3) require that the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education include a representative of a school of clinical psychology; and (4) add graduate programs in clinical psychology to provisions relating to discrimination on the basis of sex."
