Requires the Foundation to convey such acquisitions to the Director upon request for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Authorizes the Foundation to convey lands to other parties or to make grants to other parties for land acquisition if such lands would be administered for the long-term conservation and management of fish and wildlife. Authorizes the Foundation, with the consent of the Director, to convey lands at not less than fair market value if they are no longer valuable for conservation purposes. Authorizes the Foundation to reimburse the Secretary of the Interior for administrative expenses. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of the Interior for FY 1988 through 1993 for the Foundation."
