Terminates such limitations upon the receipt by the Congress of written certification from the President that the Soviet Union has exceeded such limitations. Waives such limitations if: (1) the President so requests in writing to the Congress, citing the national security reasons for such waiver; and (2) the Congress authorizes such waiver by bill or joint resolution."
