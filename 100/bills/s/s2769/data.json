Sets forth a minimum grant amount. Directs the Secretary to reserve five percent of the amount appropriated for any fiscal year to carry out this Act for projects of national significance which are expected to have a significant impact in preventing use of drugs among youth. Requires, if the amount appropriated is under a specified amount, that 25 percent of the amount appropriated be allotted equally among the 50 States, with the remainder apportioned according to stated priorities. Sets forth general priorities in making the grants. Declares that the assistance received under this Act may be used for: (1) State regional substance abuse education and prevention centers designed to provide technical assistance, outreach, consultation, training, and referral services; (2) community services and partnerships designed to develop community activities targeted at substance abuse prevention through education, training, and recreation projects; and (3) other projects or proposals consistent with the intent of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993. Directs the Secretary to evaluate projects conducted with assistance under this Act. Requires grant applications to include a description of the method to be used in evaluating the impact the program is having on the drug problem within the community."
