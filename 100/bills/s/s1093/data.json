Requires the President to submit a report to the Congress every 60 days on the human rights situation in Romania and to continue to submit such reports whether or not such nondiscriminatory treatment is restored. Specifies that if the President restores such nondiscriminatory treatment after the six-month suspension period, the President's next report shall contain an assessment as to whether such restoration will also substantially alleviate human rights concerns."
