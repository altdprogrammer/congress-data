    "text": "Makes it unlawful, until June 1, 1997, for foreign-built vessels that are U.S.-documented after January 1, 1987, to engage in the processing of fish for commercial use or consumption. Amends Federal shipping provisions to require all of the seamen employed on a U.S.-documented fish processing vessel to be U.S. citizens. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations necessary to obtain information on the transportation of fish products by vessels of the United States from foreign fish processing vessels to points in the United States. Directs the Secretary, within six months after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee concerning the transportation of such fish products and its potential impact on the development of the U.S. domestic fishing industry, together with legislative recommendations."
