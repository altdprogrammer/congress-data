Requires the Administrator to publish such notice in the Federal Register at the same time that increases under title II of the Social Security Act are required to be published. Title II: Agent Orange and Related Provisions - Veterans' Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1988 - Part A: Agent Orange Presumptions, Benefits, Research, and Outreach Matters - Directs the Administrator to pay a monthly disability or death benefit to Vietnam veterans having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma.

Provides a conditional expiration date for the provision of interim benefits. Requires the Administrator to take specified action to notify eligible veterans of such benefits. Provides a presumption of service-connection for a Vietnam veteran suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma for purposes of eligibility for veterans' wartime disability compensation. Provides that, for purposes of eligibility for such benefits, certain diseases incurred by Vietnam veterans exposed to dioxin and other toxic agents shall be considered service-connected. Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with an appropriate nonprofit scientific organization in order to make determinations concerning diseases associated with effects of exposure to certain toxic agents or effects of serving in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Requires certain reports among the scientific organization, the Administrator, and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (the veterans' committees) concerning such determinations. Requires the Administrator, on the basis of such determinations, to issue proposed regulations which list each disease reasonably associated with such service during the Vietnam era. Outlines further administrative provisions relating to the determination and listing of diseases associated with Vietnam duty. Revises provisions relating to the payment of veterans' disability compensation for veterans suffering from listed associated diseases before final regulations are issued by the Administrator concerning such diseases. Provides a special effective date for the award of veterans' disability compensation if the Administrator fails to issue final regulations regarding associated diseases within 180 days after the scientific organization makes its determinations. Prohibits the Administrator from entering into an agreement with a nonprofit scientific organization, other than an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, until specifically authorized to do so by an Act other than this Act.

Directs the Administrator to establish a program to provide for studies of the feasibility of conducting additional scientific research on health hazards resulting from exposure to dioxin or other toxic agents by Vietnam veterans during the Vietnam era. Outlines program and report requirements relating to such feasibility studies. Requires consultation with the National Academy of Sciences on such program and studies. Directs the Administrator to: (1) conduct an outreach program for furnishing to Vietnam veterans information relating to health risks incurred as the result of exposure to dioxin or other toxic agents during their service, as well as services and benefits available to such veterans; (2) update the information on veterans contained in the Veterans' Administration Agent Orange Registry; and (3) organize the information contained in such Registry so as to promptly notify a veteran of any increased health risk resulting from such exposure. Directs the Administrator to promptly furnish such information to the veterans' committees. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, to report to the veterans' committees a discussion of the research being conducted to identify and develop treatments for physiological absorption of dioxin and other toxic agents used in support of the U.S. and allied operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Provides a presumption of service-connection for a Vietnam veteran suffering from chloracne. Part B: Advisory Committee on Special Studies Relating to the Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Phenoxy Herbicides and Contaminants - Requires that, as of March 1, 1989, no less than one-third of the total membership of the Advisory Committee on Special Studies Relating to the Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Phenoxy Herbicides and Contaminants (the Committee) shall be individuals selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from among scientists recommended by veterans' organizations and determined by the Secretary to be qualified. Authorizes the Chairman of the Committee to be an officer or employee of the Federal Government only if the Secretary makes certain determinations. Directs the Committee to directly consult with and provide information and recommendations to the Department of the Air Force scientists conducting the Ranch Hand Study (relating to the possible long-term health effects of phenoxy herbicides and contaminants on Air Force personnel who participated in Operation Ranch Hand in Vietnam during the Vietnam era). Requires certain reports from the Secretary of Defense to the veterans' committees on the Ranch Hand Study and other related studies. Part C: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date for this title. Extends through 1990 health-care eligibility for benefits for veterans suffering from a disease based on Agent Orange or ionizing radiation exposure.
