    "text": "Pet Theft Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (the Act) to prohibit, except in instances where State or local law supersedes, class B licensees (dealers) from obtaining live random source dogs and cats from: (1) a source other than a State, county, or city owned and operated pound; (2) a private entity established for the purpose of caring for animals (such as a humane society or any other organization that is under contract with a State, county, or city that operates as a pound or shelter, and that releases animals on a voluntary basis); (3) research facilities licensed by the Department of Agriculture; or (4) individuals who have bred and raised such dogs and cats on their own premises. Requires such pounds, shelters, or organizations to hold and care for dogs or cats for at least seven days before selling them to dealers (thus enabling them to be recovered by their original owners or adopted by other individuals). Prohibits dealers from selling, providing, or making available to any individual or entity a random source dog or cat without providing the recipient with a valid certification. Sets forth certification requirements. Requires the original certification to accompany the shipment of the dog or cat to the recipient, and a copy to be retained by the dealer. Requires the recipients and dealers to retain such certificates or copies for at least one year for enforcement purposes. Requires a copy of the certificate to accompany any transfer of an animal from one research facility to another. Subjects dealers who fail to act according to the requirements of this Act, or who include false information in the certification, to: (1) specified penalties under the Act; (2) a fine of $5,000 per dog or cat for subsequent violations; and (3) permanent revocation of their license for violating such requirements three or more times. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act."
