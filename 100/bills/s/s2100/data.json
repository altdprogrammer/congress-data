Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to extend its cost sharing and cost ceiling provisions to all water resources projects enacted after the date of enactment of such Act. Requires the Chief of the Soil Conservation Service to cooperate with the Secretary of the Army in the Beaver Lake Water quality project in Arkansas. Directs the Secretary to use available funds to continue planning and design for such project, including plans for individual parcels of land within the drainage basis which contribute to water quality degradation and impairment of water supply uses at Beaver Lake. Modifies the project for flood control, West Memphis and vicinity, Arkansas, to provide that non-Federal cooperation for such project may be provided by private individuals, private organizations, levee districts, drainage districts, or any unit of a State, country, or local government. Authorizes the Secretary to construct the breakwaters to a greater height at the project at King Harbor, Redondo Beach, California, if recommended in a report of the Chief of Engineers and approved by the Secretary. Modifies the navigation project for Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors, San Pedro Bay, California, to provide that if non-Federal interests carry out any work associated with such project which is later recommended by the Chief of Engineers and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary may reimburse such non-Federal interests an amount equal to the Federal share of the costs, without interest. Directs the Secretary to perform maintenance dredging of the Federal project at the mouth of the Los Angeles River, California, to an authorized depth to maintain the flood control basin and navigation safety. Modifies the demonstration project at Sunset Harbor, California, to wetland restoration as a project purpose. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to require that the Federal share of the cost of the project for Indiana shoreline erosion be determined in accordance with title I of such Act. Modifies the project for mitigation of fish and wildlife losses at Stumpy Lake, Louisiana, to: (1) include design and construction of such structural and remedial measures as necessary to control erosion and protect certain valuable environmental resources; and (2) authorize the Secretary to spend certain funds in participation with Louisiana on design, construction, and purchase of necessary lands and rights-of-way. Modifies the navigation project at Annapolis Harbor, Maryland, to direct the Secretary to realign the channel in such project to promote more efficient mooring operations. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the remaining cost for the navigation project for Deal Island, Maryland (Lower Thorofare). Modifies the project for flood control at Redwood River, Marshall, Minnesota, to authorize the Secretary to construct the project in accordance with a specified memorandum and at increased costs. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to provide that the flood control project for Root River Basin, Minnesota, does not affect the authority of the Secretary to carry out a small project under the Flood Control Act of 1948. Modifies the flood control project, Roseau River, Minnesota, to direct the Secretary to construct a flood control levee in the vicinity of Duxby, Minnesota. Modifies the navigation project at Gulfport Harbor, Mississippi, to alter the methods by which the Secretary, during construction of the project, may carry out a demonstration program to evaluate the costs and benefits of thin layer disposal in the Mississippi Sount of dredged material. Directs the Secretary, during construction of the project, to carry out a demonstration program to evaluate the costs and benefits of thin layer disposal in the Mississippi Sound of dredged material from construction harbor improvements and to determine whether there are unacceptable adverse effects from such disposal. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) within one year of completion of the demonstration program. Provides for the Administrator of the EPA to approve or disapprove the report. Requires the Secretary to establish a study team to assist in planning, carrying out, monitoring, and reporting on the program.
