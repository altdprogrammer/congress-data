Requires the Administrator to: (1) determine the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of such pilot program; and (2) report to the Congress the results of such evaluation and the Administrator's views on the relationship between the provision of such a monkey and the payment of an aid and attendance allowance or an annual pension based on the need for aid and attendance."
