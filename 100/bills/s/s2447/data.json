Sets forth specified implementation steps including transmission to the Congress of a comprehensive flight demonstration plan. Confers responsibility upon the Secretary of Energy for those aspects of the research and development program which are suitable for a fully integrated hydrogen fueled aircraft system but which are not specifically developed for such application. Grants the Administrator overall management responsibility for program implementation. Establishes the Hydrogen-Fueled Aircraft Advisory Committee to advise the Administrator regarding the research and development program. Requires an annual report to the Administrator of its findings and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992."
