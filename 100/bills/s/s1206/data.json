Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to make allotments to States, according to a specified formula, to be used for home health care services, including: (1) compensating physicians, nurses, and social workers in planning, managing, or providing home health care; (2) identifying and locating individuals in need of such care; (3) developing standards and quality assurance mechanisms; (4) coordinating home health care services with other social services; (5) coordinating long-term care services; and (6) training health professionals other than physicians, nurses, and social workers. Allows States to use allotments for the home health care of eligible individuals through grants to health care organizations, subject to certain conditions. Restricts the portion of the amount paid to States which may be used for activities other than compensation for the services of physicians, nurses, and social workers in planning, managing, or providing home health care. Limits the amount a State may use for any individual in a year for certain services. Sets forth application procedures for such allotments. Makes applicable to this Act provisions of existing law relating to adjustments in payments to States, annual reports and audits, withholding of payments for cause, nondiscrimination, and penalties for false statements. Requires annual reports to include an analysis of cost effectiveness. Directs the Secretary to conduct evaluations of services provided and activities carried out with payments to States under this Act."
