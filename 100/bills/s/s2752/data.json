    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Expands the Quinault Indian Reservation to include specified lands within the Olympic National Forest. Directs the United States to hold those lands in trust for the Quinault Nation. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to manage those Federal lands within the Olympic National Forest generally depicted on the map entitled \"Quinault Special Management Area.\" Specifies that transfer of receipts to the Quinault Indian Nation from National Forest lands does not create a trust or other fiduciary responsibility on the Secretary beyond that which may currently exist. Grants the Secretary up to ten percent of the gross proceeds from the sale of forest products from lands within the Quinault Special Management Area for preparation and administration of timber sales from such lands. Provides that 45 percent of all monies received during any fiscal year from such lands shall be paid to the State of Washington and 45 percent shall be deposited into an account established by the Secretary of the Interior for the Quinault Indians. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from approving the sale for export of unprocessed timber from such lands, unless he determines that such timber is surplus to domestic needs. Requires the Secretary to limit the sale of timber from such lands. Requires timber and forest products from such lands to be administered in the same manner as lands subject to restrictions of the Grays Harbor sustained yield unit administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to grant rights-of-way through the lands to assure access to National Forest land. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to allow rights-of-way through National Forest System lands to provide access to the reservation. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a separate account for timber receipts from the lands. Provides that these funds can be used by the Quinault Nation only for paying costs incurred in preparing and administering timber sales, mitigating adverse environmental impacts from timber harvest activities, reforesting timber lands, and to purchase land that is within reservation boundaries. Provides that the Forest timber receipts of adjacent counties shall not be affected. Continues to recognize any valid rights-of-way, leases, or permits which may exist in the lands. Provides that existing property rights within the exterior boundaries of the reservation shall not be affected."
