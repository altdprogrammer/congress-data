Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary of Energy the amount calculated according to such formula. Precludes the use of such funds for repository costs resulting from permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste from atomic energy defense activities. Makes such funds available for FY 1988 through 1992. Requires the Secretary of Energy, in conjunction with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to: (1) develop a comprehensive plan, including a timetable and estimated costs, for the cleanup of hazardous or radioactive waste from atomic energy defense activities; and (2) submit such plan to specified congressional committees."
