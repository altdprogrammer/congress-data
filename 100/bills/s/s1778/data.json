Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, institutions of higher education or public or private nonprofit agencies (including regional educational laboratories), or combinations of such institutions or agencies to pay all or part of the cost of establishing and operating ten regional rural assistance centers. Requires each such center to provide technical assistance, consultation, training, and other assistance to State and local educational agencies in the region to improve the quality of education to educationally disadvantaged children participating in chapter 1 programs (under the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981) who reside in rural areas or attend small schools. Directs the Secretary to give priority to certain applications in carrying out this Act. Sets forth center coordination and dissemination requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993."
