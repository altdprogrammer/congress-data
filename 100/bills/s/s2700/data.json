Requires contributing sponsors and their controlled groups to pay into a plan amounts necessary to pay benefits and administrative expenses for as long as plan assets are not sufficient. Makes the sponsors and all members of the controlled group jointly and severally liable for the payments. Grants to the district courts jurisdiction over all PBGC actions to terminate a plan, regardless of the amount in controversy."
