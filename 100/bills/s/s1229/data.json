    "date": "1987-05-19", 
    "text": "Adult Education Act Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Adult Education Act to revise the definition of \"adult\" for purposes of such Act and remove the limitation on the percentage of funds that a State may use to support adult education programs for institutionalized individuals, including persons who are incarcerated. Alters the basis on which grant funds are allotted to the States, including Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Revises provisions that require a State plan to include programs to address the needs of persons with limited proficiency in English. Decreases from 90 percent to 75 percent the Federal share of expenditures to carry out a State plan and prescribes actions that the Secretary of Education must take when it is determined that a State has not met its expenditure requirements with respect to non-Federal funds. Limits a State educational agency's costs of administering the State's program. Eliminates provisions authorizing the Director of the National Institute of Education to use certain funds to support research on the special needs of individuals requiring adult education. Delays until October 1, 1992, the termination date for the National Advisory Council on Adult Education (currently due to terminate on October 1, 1988.) Revises the membership and reporting requirements of the Council. Authorizes FY 1988 through 1992 appropriations."
