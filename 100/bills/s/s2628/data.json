    "text": "New Jersey-New York Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a demonstration program to track, by the use of a manifest system, medical waste generated and disposed of in New York and New Jersey. Makes such program applicable to generators of medical waste and owners and operators of facilities for the treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of medical waste. Requires such parties to permit access to and provide copies of all records relating to such wastes to any designated EPA representative. Provides for the enforcement of program requirements by use of the Act's hazardous waste management enforcement mechanisms. Prohibits the interpretation of this Act as precluding any State or locality from imposing more stringent requirements for the control or monitoring of medical waste. Requires the EPA to report to the Congress on the progress of the demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1991."
