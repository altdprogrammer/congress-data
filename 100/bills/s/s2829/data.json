Authorizes the Attorney General to designate the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the lead agency for performing the functions authorized by this Act and to establish such advisory boards as may be necessary to assist the Bureau. Requires the Director of the Bureau to classify offenses involving illegal drugs and drug trafficking as a part I crime in the Uniform Crime Reports. Authorizes appropriations."
