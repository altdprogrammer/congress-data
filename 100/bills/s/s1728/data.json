Requires the Administrator to: (1) implement a development and certification schedule resulting within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act in the completion of TCAS-II certification; (2) report monthly to the Congress on TCAS-II development and certification; (3) require that civil aircraft with a maximum passenger capacity of more than 30 seats have an operational TCAS-II within 30 months after the certification of such system; and (4) require that automatic pressure altitude-encoding equipment be operated on certain civil aircraft operating in a high traffic density area. Requires the Administrator to complete as soon as possible research, development, and certification of the TCAS-III collision avoidance system. Authorizes appropriations."
