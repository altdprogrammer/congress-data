Reimburses hospitals for the costs of such programs on the same basis as hospitals are reimbursed for resident physician program costs. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress by January 1, 1992, on the effect of such coverage on the supply and characteristics of nurses. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct up to four demonstration projects under each of which a hospital tests the effects of different personnel-related activities in promoting the recruitment and retention of nurses. Requires that such projects conclude before FY 1989. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the results of such projects by January 1, 1992. Authorizes appropriations for the demonstration projects from FY 1989 through 1991."
