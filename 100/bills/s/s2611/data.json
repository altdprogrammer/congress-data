Amends Federal law to prohibit the Administrator of the VA from using this tax return information to terminate, deny, suspend, or reduce a person's benefits or services without first: (1) taking appropriate steps to verify independently the amount and accessibility of the income in question, and (2) providing the affected individual with notice and an opportunity to respond to the findings. Restricts the Administrator's right to verify or act upon information relating to disability compensation. Directs the Administrator to notify applicants for and recipients of VA benefits that income information they provide may be compared with tax return data."
