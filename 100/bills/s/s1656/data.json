Requires the President to annually determine and certify to the Congress: (1) which members of COCOM have not complied with the export controls agreed upon by the COCOM member countries; and (2) for each such country, the value in dollars of the estimated damage to the United States which was incurred as a result of such noncompliance. Limits the amount of foreign military sales credits and military assistance received by a country identified by such determination."
