    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #32 (360-39)) Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to specify wheat, rice, and feed grains acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) through price support operations as eligible commodities for agricultural assistance under title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make available to nonprofit and voluntary agencies and cooperatives in any country the same commodities available to it as a country friendly to the United States. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to make multiyear commodity distribution or sale agreements. Increases: (1) the scope of nonprofit and voluntary agency or cooperative foreign currency programs; and (2) the aggregate value of commodities available for such activities. Directs the Secretary, no later than 45 days after submission, to take final action on a proposal submitted by a nonprofit and voluntary agency or cooperative, with the concurrence of the field mission, for the delivery of commodities requested. Directs the Secretary, no later than 30 days prior to the issuance of a final guideline issued to carry out the Act, to provide notice of the proposed guideline to participating nonprofit agencies and cooperatives and to make such guideline available for review and comment. Directs that such commodity purchase or supply orders be transmitted to the CCC within 15 days of receipt of a qualifying field mission request. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the farmer to farmer program through FY 1990. Makes the Federal Advisory Committee Act inapplicable to the activities of an agricultural and trade mission (as established by P.L. 100-202)."
