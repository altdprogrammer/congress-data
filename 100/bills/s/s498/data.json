Declares that it is a U.S. negotiating objective to enhance the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) through: (1) the adoption of an additional GATT article declaring that the denial of internationally recognized worker rights is an unjustifiable means for a country or any of its industries to gain competitive advantage in international trade; (2) the amendment of the GATT to affirm such principle; or (3) the adoption and implementation of a code of internationally recognized worker rights."
