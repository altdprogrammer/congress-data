Provides for the development of training materials and procedures, including standards for trainers and training programs. Provides for separate standards for commercial and private applicators. Requires refresher training. Requires pesticide dealers to maintain sales and distribution records. Title VII: Additional Data, Data Compensation, and Patents - Requires each registrant of an active ingredient pesticide used only in food, feed, or fiber production to jointly develop, or share in the development costs of, additional data. Revises data compensation provisions. Extends patents for certain pesticide, chemical, and plant products that undergo regulatory review prior to commercial marketing. Provides that during the last two years of a registered pesticide's patent it shall not be an act of patent infringement to make, use, or sell such pesticide solely for testing reasonably related to the development or submission of certain required data. Title VIII: General - Subtitle A: Amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act - Provides for State regulation, under specified conditions, of household antimicrobial pesticides not intended for use on food or feed. Terminates such authority five years after enactment of this Act. Permits a State, in regulating pesticide sales or uses, to take into account the difference in concept and usage between various pesticide classes and the differences in environmental risk (and risk evaluation) between agricultural and nonagricultural pesticides. Terminates State primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide violations as of January 1, 1990, unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines that the State has the authority to impose civil and criminal penalties at least equal to those provided for in this Act.
