    "text": "Amends Federal law relating to burial benefits for deceased veterans to authorize the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to reimburse a veteran for the cost of a prepurchased headstone (in lieu of furnishing such a headstone at burial). Revises Federal provisions concerning plot allowances to authorize such allowances only to veterans who are either eligible for a burial allowance or who were discharged from active-duty due to a service-connected disability. (Currently, a veteran of any war, whether or not disabled, is eligible for such plot allowance.) Amends Federal provisions relating to the making of grants to States for the establishment, expansion, and improvement of veterans' cemeteries to remove the limitation of a maximum grant to a single State based on the total funds available for such grants. Authorizes the Administrator to provide flat grave markers for use at a national cemetery in Wood, Wisconsin."
