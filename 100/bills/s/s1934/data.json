Subjects all final decisions regarding architectural design of the building to the approval of the Chief Justice of the United States. Prohibits the Architect from making any payment to any person for any bid or design proposal submitted under the competition. Specifies limitations on the height, size, and design of the building. Authorizes the Architect to enter into an agreement with the person selected to develop the judicial building. Provides that all design, development, and construction costs will be at no cost to the United States. Declares that title to the property site will remain in the United States. Provides for the reversion of title to the building and other improvements to the United States at the expiration of not more than 30 years after the Architect enters into a lease agreement. Allows the building to be connected to the Capitol Power Plant. Specifies construction standards and requires periodic inspections. Directs the Architect to enter into a lease agreement with the builder for a term of 30 years before entering into the development agreement. Sets forth responsibilities, after occupancy of such building, with respect to structural and mechanical care, security, and allocation of space. Requires the Administrator of General Services expeditiously to vacate any space occupied in such building by the General Services Administration when notified by the Chief Justice that the judicial branch requires additional space. Requires any other entity in such building to vacate its space within 90 days of such notification. Establishes the Commission for the Judiciary Office Building to be responsible for the supervision of design, construction, operation, maintenance, structural, mechanical, and domestic care and security of the building to be constructed under this Act. Amends the National Visitor Center Facilities Act of 1968 to repeal the authority of the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the building property. Establishes a separate fund in the Treasury for the deposit of amounts available to the Architect to pay expenses under this Act."
