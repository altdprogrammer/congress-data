Restricts the release of information concerning cave location to protect the resource, requiring the Governor of a State in which a cave resource is located or a bona fide research institution to request location information in writing along with a commitment to protect the confidentiality of such information. Establishes a permit program for the collection or removal of natural resources from caves on Federal lands. Requires a permittee to post a bond or cash deposit to offset potential damage. Revokes permits for violations of this Act or permit conditions. Excludes Federal cave resources within the National Park or Wildlife Refuge Systems from this program. Imposes criminal penalties for the alteration of a cave or interference with cave resources, including the sale or exchange of cave resources removed without permission. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act or permit conditions. Authorizes appropriations. Places permit fees and fines in a special fund in the Treasury for cave resource management."
