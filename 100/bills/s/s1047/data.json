Authorizes the Ninth Judicial Circuit of the United States to provide assistance to the the courts of the freely associated states (Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau). Permits the Chief Justice of the United States or the chief judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit to authorize any circuit judge of, or district judge within, the Ninth Circuit to serve temporarily as a judge of any court of a freely associated state. Amends the Compact of Free Association to: (1) direct that the agricultural and food programs for the Biikini and Enewetak Atolls be provided by a U.S. or Marshallese contractor through a grant to the Government of the Marshall Islands; and (2) authorize the food programs of the Rongelap and Utrik people. Authorizes the President to negotiate agreements which provide that: (1) the United States shall provide for the distribution of controlled substances in the freely associated states under the Controlled Substances Act; or (2) the freely associated states shall be eligible for U.S. exports of narcotic drugs upon establishing and maintaining a system to report annual estimates of narcotic need to the International Control Board and imposing control on such drugs consistent with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. Designates Northern Marianas College as a depository to receive Government publications and directs the Superintendent of Documents to supply to the College one copy of each such publication. Amends the Education Amendments of 1972 to add the Northern Marianas College to the list of land grant colleges in the territories to receive an endowment. Authorizes the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to treat waste water treatment funds as grants, provided that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency concurs. Waives a requirement for local matching funds in order to have a Federal program or project apply to or take place in the Insular Areas. Amends the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to require the President (currently, the Attorney General) to appoint a U.S. marshal for the Virgin Islands. Repeals the requirements that the District Court of the Virgin Islands for the Division of Saint Croix be held in Christiansted and for the Division of Saint Thomas and Saint John at Charlotte Amalie.
