Provides that when a taxpayer transfers a commodity that serves as collateral for a Commodity Credit Corporation loan, repays the loan with the proceeds of the transfer, and repurchases the commodity with a commodity certificate, the original transfer shall not be considered a taxable event for income tax purposes. Applies retroactively, with a limited exception, to loan redemptions occurring in 1986 and thereafter."
