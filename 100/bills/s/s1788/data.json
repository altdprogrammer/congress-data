Prohibits the sale of antifouling paint containing organotin or its application to a vessel unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency certifies that the release rate of such paint is below a specified level. Prohibits the sale of organotin paint additives. Permits the use of existing stockpiles for no more than 180 days following enactment. Sets forth certification procedures. Directs the Administrator to monitor and report annually for seven years to specified congressional officials on the concentrations of organotin in representative estuaries. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to periodically test and report to the Administrator and the State Governor on organotin contamination in waters and harbors serving as the home port for any Navy vessel. Imposes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Requires the Administrator to study and report to specified congressional officials on alternative antifouling chemicals and systems. Requires sale and use prohibitions to continue until a final decision on the release of organotin into the aquatic environment through such paints takes effect."
