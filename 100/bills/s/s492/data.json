Rept. 100-314) Building and Construction Industry Labor Law Amendments of 1987 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to provide that any two or more business entities engaged primarily in the building and construction industry, performing work within the geographical area covered by a collective bargaining agreement to which any of the entities is a party, and performing the type of work described in such agreement, shall be deemed a single employer if they have, directly or indirectly, substantial common ownership, management, or control. Provides that the terms and provisions of a contractor-subcontractor relationship shall not be deemed to create a single employer or to be evidence of direct or indirect management or control for such purposes. Applies the terms of a collective bargaining agreement regarding employees of such business entities to all other business entities comprising the single employer and performing the work described in the collective bargaining agreement within the geographical area covered by it. States that collective bargaining agreements may only be repudiated after the National Labor Relations Board certifies election results in which a majority of the employees either selects a bargaining representative other than the representative with whom such agreement was made or chooses not to be represented by a labor organization."
