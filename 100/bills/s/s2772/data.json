Requires any drug treatment program that receives Federal assistance to give priority to the treatment of pregnant women and afford them the first opportunity to receive treatment, notwithstanding any waiting list.

Requires applicants to agree to provide: (1) outreach to pregnant women who are abusers of alcohol or illegal drugs; (2) substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation; (3) prenatal care to pregnant women who are abusers of alcohol or illegal drugs; (4) counseling; (5) coordination with other Federal, State, and local programs designed to assist pregnant women; and (6) continued assistance to women who have received assistance under this Act and their infant children.
