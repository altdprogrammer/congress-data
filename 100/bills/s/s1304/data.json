    "text": "Ethanol Motor Fuel Act of 1987 - Mandates that in any calendar year beginning with calendar year 1988, the total quantity of motor fuel sold annually in U.S. commerce by wholesale distributors shall contain, on the average, not less than a specified percentage of ethanol by volume in calendar years 1988 through 1992 and thereafter. Sets forth a computation formula for measuring the percentage of ethanol in motor fuel sold by a wholesale distributor. Requires wholesale distributors of motor fuel to report to the Secretary of Energy regarding ethanol sales and credits. Imposes a civil penalty on wholesale distributors for violation of the ethanol-blended fuel requirements. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to promote ethanol use in motor fuel."
