Authorizes the Commission to appoint other staff members to be paid from donations. Eliminates the limit on the number of employees detailed from Federal agencies which the Commission may accept. Authorizes payment of travel expenses to persons appointed to Commission advisory committees. Allows the Commission to authorize and charge fees for the manufacture, reproduction, use, sale, or distribution of the Christopher Columbus Quicentenary Logo (Logo). Makes fees charged available to the Commission. Continues in effect all rules and regulations issued by the Commission regarding the use of any Commission logo before the enactment of this Act. Declares that suits or actions commenced before the effective date of the Logo provisions of this Act shall continue unabated. Extends the date for termination of the Commission."
