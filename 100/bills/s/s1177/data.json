Requires, upon expiration of the debt issuance suspension, the issuance of obligations that bear such interest rates and maturity dates as ensure the replication of obligations that would be held by the Fund if such suspension period had not occurred. Requires the Secretary to pay to the Fund the excess of the net amount of interest that would have been earned during the suspension period. Requires the Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, on each business day during the debt issuance suspension period, to notify the Secretary of the amounts, by maturity, that would have been invested or redeemed each day had the suspension period not occurred. Sets forth reporting requirements for the Secretary regarding the operation and status of the Thrift Savings Fund."
