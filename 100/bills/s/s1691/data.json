Revises restrictions on the sale by the VA Administration of notes of security loans financing the purchase of real property acquired by the Administrator as a result of a default on a VA loan. Allows such sale: (1) with recourse (i.e., creating direct liability on the part of the note purchaser for the full value of the note's remaining amount); or (2) without recourse, as long as the amount received is equal to the unpaid balance of such loan."
