Prohibits such reimbursement if the sale or purchase (or unexpired lease settlement) occurs before employees are notified that they will not be returning to the same post within the United States. Authorizes Federal agencies upon the separation of a career appointee in the Senior Executive Service to pay certain travel and transportation expenses of that individual to the individual's residence within the United States, its territories or possessions, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or specified areas of the Republic of Panama, if such individual: (1) has previously been transferred from one official station or agency to another for permanent duty during the term of Government employment; and (2) is eligible to receive a Federal annuity."
