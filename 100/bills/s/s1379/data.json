    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to provide additional sanctions against a foreign country determined to be a drug-producing or drug-transit country that has failed to cooperate with the United States in combatting drug trafficking. Specifies such sanctions as: (1) limiting by one-half the number of non-immigrant visas that may be issued for aliens born in that country; (2) curtailing air transportation between the United States and that country; and (3) the mandatory withdrawal of the United States from participation in any arrangement with that country for the pre-clearance of customs by visitors between the United States and that country. Sets forth procedures for the curtailment of air transportation. Includes the taking of the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate corruption by government officials (with particular emphasis on the elimination of bribery) as a factor to be considered in the determination of whether a foreign country has failed to cooperate."
