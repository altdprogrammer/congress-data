    "text": "At-Risk Youth Employment and Training Amendments of 1988- Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to add an optional year-round program for at-risk youth employment and training uner title II, part B provisions for summer youth employment and training programs. Revises the method of allocating funds for part B programs. Allows each service delivery area, in addition to or in lieu of the services for eligible individuals available under summer youth employment and training programs, to elect to use its part B funds for at-risk youth employemnt and training programs, which may be conducted on a year-round basis. Makes eligible for the at-risk youth program individuals who are: (1) aged 14 through 21; (2) economically disadvantaged; and (3) deficient in basic skills. Requires special consideration to be given to serving eligible youth who experience severe disadvantages, such as: (1) school dropouts; (2) students with poor academic and attendance records; (3) individuals with a history of behavioral problems; (4) students who are older than the normal age for their grade level; (5) pregnant or parenting teens; (6) drug or alcohol abusers; (7) handicapped youth; (8) juvenile offenders; (9) recipients or members of families receiving public assistance; (10) runaway or homeless youth or youth in foster care; or (11) victims of child abuse. Allows individuals who are not economically disadvantaged to comprise up to ten percent of program participants if they have experienced severe disadvantages like those described. Requires services provided to each program participant to include: (1) an assessment of reading, mathematics, and other basic skills; (2) development of a severe strategy; and (3) basic skills assistance. Lists other services for which program funds may be used for in-school, dropout-prone youth and for school dropouts and out-of-school youth. Allows needs-based payments for program participation and compensation in the form of work-experience wages. Requires participating service delivery areas to establish at-risk program linkages with local educational agencies and other appropriate entities. Grants private industry councils the same authority, duties, and responsibilities for planning and administration of funds for the at-risk youth program as they and other specified officials and entities have under title I part A provisions of JTPA, with the additional responsibility of ensuring coordination of service delivery areas, local educational agencies, and other participating agencies in planning, program design, and provision of services. Lists administrative cost expenditures to 15 percent of program funds. Directs the Secretary of Labor to prescribe performance standards for the at-risk youth program."
