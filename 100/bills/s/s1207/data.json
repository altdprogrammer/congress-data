Requires rural hospitals wishing to participate in the program to submit an application specifying the nature of the hospital's proposed grant project and a timetable (of no more than two years) for its completion to the State Governor, who shall transmit it to the Secretary within 30 days with his or her comments on such application. Directs the Secretary to consider such comments, each project's objectives, and each project's effect in reducing expenditures under part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program in choosing among applicants for such grants. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989."
