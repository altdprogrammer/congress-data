Sets forth certain features of such coins and provides for their design, issuance, and sale. Terminates authority to mint coins under this Act after December 31, 1990. Requires a specified amount of all surcharges received from the sale of the coins to be provided to the \"Documents West\" exhibition program and administered by the Idaho Centennial Commission, to be used only for promoting the exhibition. Requires the Secretary to deposit in the Treasury all remaining surcharges received, to be used to reduce the national debt. Declares that: (1) no law governing procurement or public contracts shall be applicable to the procurement of goods and services for this Act, except laws relating to equal employment opportunity; and (2) no firm shall be considered a Federal contractor for purposes of specified Federal regulations as a result of participating as a U.S. Mint coin consignee."
