Transfers specified national forest lands to the Secretary of the Interior. Requires lands designated for inclusion in such Forests to be managed so as not to impair their suitability for wilderness designation. Excludes such additional national forest lands from calculations for interstate (California and Nevada) but not intrastate (Nevada) distribution of the Twenty-Five Percent Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer land known as Wilbur Square to Boulder City, Nevada."
