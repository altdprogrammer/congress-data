Directs the Commission, within one year after a specified review by the National Park Service, to submit to the Secretary of the Interior a Cultural Heritage and Corridor Management Plan which: (1) provides an inventory of Corridor property to be preserved and restored because of its national historic or cultural significance; (2) develops a historic interpretive plan; and (3) recommends policies for resource management of the Corridor. Terminates the Commission in five years, with a possible five-year extension. Requires the Secretary to approve or disapprove the Commission's Plan within 60 days after its receipt. Authorizes appropriations."
