    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Drunk Driving Prevention Act of 1988 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make basic and supplemental grants to States which adopt and implement certain drunk driving prevention programs. Requires States, in order to receive basic grants under this Act, to provide: (1) an expedited driver's license suspension or revocation system; and (2) a self-sustaining drunk driving prevention program. Sets forth additional requirements for the receipt of supplemental grants, which include: (1) providing for mandatory blood alcohol content testing whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a driver involved in a collision that results in a death or serious bodily injury has committed an alcohol-related traffic offense; (2) providing for an effective system for preventing drivers under the age of 21 from obtaining alcoholic beverages; (3) providing for the unlawfulness of possession of any open alcoholic beverage container and consumption of any alcoholic beverage in the passenger area (except as allowed on charter transportation or otherwise allowed by the State); or (4) providing for the registration suspension and return of license plates by an individual convicted of certain alcohol-related traffic offenses. Provides that no State may receive grants for more than three fiscal years. Sets forth the Federal share payable for such grants for each of the three fiscal years. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires the Secretary to: (1) enter into arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to determine the blood alcohol concentration level at or above which an individual is deemed to be driving while under the influence; (2) issue and publish proposed and final regulations to implement this Act; and (3) conduct and report to specified congressional committees on a study to determine an effective method for the Federal Government to provide State law enforcement officials with all information concerning previous arrest for drunk driving offenses in any State."
