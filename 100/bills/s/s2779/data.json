    "text": "Advanced Nuclear Reactor Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to implement, according to certain guidelines, a research, development, and demonstration program for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission. Sets a deadline by which the Secretary must make recommendations to the Congress regarding existing programs and facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to implement any of such recommendations which have not been disapproved by Congress within one year after receipt of the report. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1991 and 1992. Mandates that a portion of such appropriations be used to support construction of a commercial-scale advanced civilian nuclear power reactor demonstration project which is to be connected to a utility grid by the year 2000. Outlines conditions under which proposals for such project may be submitted and accepted, including licensing and cost-sharing with non-Federal funds. Requires the Secretary to submit specific recommendations to the Congress regarding changes that are needed in Federal laws and regulations for the timely licensing of commercial nuclear power reactors whose design is based upon the commercial-scale advanced civilian nuclear power reactor demonstration project. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to report to the Congress on the licensibility of commercially available nuclear reactor technologies in use in foreign nations. Requires such report to identify impediments to licensing."
