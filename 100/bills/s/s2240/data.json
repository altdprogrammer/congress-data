Mandates that appropriated funds be made available for grants matched on a basis of no less than two non-Federal dollars for each Federal dollar. Authorizes State mining and mineral resources research institutes to include the production of fuel and nonfuel mineral resources as a research and training area. Authorizes appropriations for research funds to institutes for FY 1990, and for four additional fiscal years thereafter. Increases from six to seven persons the non-Federal membership of the Committee on Mining and Mineral Resources Research. Requires the Committee to submit the annual updated national plan for mining and mineral resources research by January 15 of each calendar year. Amends the eligibility criteria for school participation as a mining and mineral resources research institute to provide that those institutions which on the date of enactment of this Act had eligible research programs in place shall retain their eligibility (subject to review during their authorized period)."
