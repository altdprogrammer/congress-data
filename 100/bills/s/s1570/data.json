    "text": "Withdraws from appropriation under the public land laws and reserves for military use by the Secretary of the Navy specified lands in California known as the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in Inyo, Kern, and San Bernardino Counties and Chocolate Mountain in Imperial County. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine every five years which of such lands are suitable for opening under the mining laws in such a way as to permit the unimpeded military use of such lands. Directs the Secretary to close such lands if necessary for national emergency, defense, or security purposes. Requires the Secretary to manage the nonmilitary uses of such lands. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate certain management authorities for China Lake to the Secretary of the Navy, including issuing easements and rights-of-way. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop within five years a land use plan and management program for Chocolate Mountain and to develop such a plan for China Lake with the Secretary of the Navy. Directs the Secretary of the Navy to report annually to the Secretary of Interior on the status of natural resources of China Lake lands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to permit the use of such lands by other Defense Department agencies and to close such lands for safety or security purposes. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to prevent and suppress brush and range fires with reimbursable assistance from the Bureau of Land Management. Makes the Secretary of the Navy responsible for the management of wild horses and burros on China Lake lands. Directs the Secretaries to enter into a memorandum of understanding to implement the opening of Chocolate Mountain lands under the mining laws. Terminates land withdrawals under this Act 25 years after its enactment. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to notify the Secretary of the Interior, at least three years before the termination of the withdrawal, whether an extension is going to be requested and, if not, to what extent such lands are contaminated with hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to decontaminate relinquished lands, but if such decontamination is not practicable or economically feasible, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to review such refused lands every five years to determine if decontamination has become practicable or feasible so that such lands may again be presented to the Secretary of the Interior for acceptance. Exempts the United States from liability for injuries or damages resulting from nonmilitary activity on withdrawn lands."
