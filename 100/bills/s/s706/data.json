Revises one such restriction to permit bank holding companies to conduct insurance activities in places with populations or 5,000 or less only so long as the principal place of the holding company's bank business is also located in a place with a population of 5,000 or less. Amends the National Bank Act to permit a national bank to conduct insurance activities only so long as such activities are confined to the place in which the bank is located and doing business and the population of such place does not exceed 5,000."
