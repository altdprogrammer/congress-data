    "date": "1988-06-22", 
    "text": "Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments of 1988 - Title I: Authorizations - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to authorize FY 1989 and 1990 appropriations for: (1) the emergency shelter grants program; (2) the supportive housing demonstration program; and (3) supplemental assistance for facilities for the homeless. Increases FY 1989 and 1990 budget authority for section 8 assistance for single room occupancy dwellings. Title II: Administrative Provisions - Provides, with regard to the comprehensive homeless assistance plan required under such Act, for: (1) plan sharing among a State and its cities and urban counties; (2) annual plan submissions; (3) inclusion of recipient assurances to maintain drug and alcohol abuse-free facilities; and (4) coordination of homeless assistance efforts. Makes religious organizations, or organizations with religious affiliations meeting specified conditions, eligible to receive housing assistance under title IV of such Act and community development block grants under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Title III: Emergency Shelter Grants - Makes the environmental policy and historic preservation provisions of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 applicable to the emergency shelter grants program. Permits States to contract directly with nonprofit organizations under such program. Increases from 15 percent to 25 percent the maximum amount of any emergency shelter grant that may be used for essential services (employment, health, education, or drug abuse). Title IV: Supportive Housing - Includes public housing agencies within the definition of \"project sponsor\" for purposes of the supportive housing demonstration program. Includes within the definition of \"permanent housing\" for purposes of such program projects in excess of the eight-person limitation in situations where local market conditions favor such projects and their development will achieve neighborhood integration objectives. Increases the limit on project advances from $20,000 to $40,000. Prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from requiring project applications to demonstrate that the applicant owns or controls the proposed project's site. Requires recipient matching funds to come from non-Federal sources. Defines \"non-Federal sources\" to include State or local agency funds, the non-Federal share of funds from other Federal programs, and the value of donated material or buildings and the value of any building lease. Authorizes operating costs assistance for permanent housing for handicapped homeless persons of up to 50 percent for the first year and 25 percent for the second year. Authorizes recipients to receive both advance and rehabilitation assistance. Permits reallocation of project assistance. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Permits the use of section 8 assistance for single room occupancy dwellings for efficiency unit rehabilitation if the public housing agency agrees to pay such units' additional rehabilitation and operating costs. Defines \"major spaces\" for fire and safety improvement purposes as hallways, large common areas, and other areas specified in local fire, building, or safety codes. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to: (1) determine whether an alternative system of distributing funds under title IV of such Act would be feasible if based on homeless population data; and (2) report to the Congress by March 1, 1989. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study of the effect of rent controls on housing stocks, including low-income housing; and (2) report to the Congress within six months of enactment of this Act. Title VI: Technical Amendments - Directs the Secretary to process the Tweemill House, New York, housing loan application without regard to certain cost and rent limits. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish guidelines for the selection of qualified rural housing purchasers in situations of more than one purchase offer. Gives priority to organizations with prior community development or low-income housing experience. Increases the construction deadline from 24 months to 30 months for purposes of housing development grant NY-015-HG-601."
