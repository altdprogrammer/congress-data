    "text": "Revision of Alien Exclusion Act of 1987 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to repeal the provision excluding an alien from U.S. entry based on ideological belief or membership in a proscribed organization. Prohibits the exclusion of an alien based on national security or foreign policy reasons unless the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, first applies for and receives approval for such exclusion from the special court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Provides for review if such application is denied, and admission if such denial is affirmed. Provides a private right of action for a person who intended to communicate with an alien denied entry on such grounds."
