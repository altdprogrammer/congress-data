    "text": "Federal Wilderness and National Park Firefighting Act of 1988 - Amends the Wilderness Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture, for national forest system lands, and the Secretary of the Interior, for lands under his jurisdiction, to aggressively fight wildfire in lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System using all available means, including chemicals and helicopters, in the same manner that wildfire would be fought on other lands not in the System. States that the Congress does not intend wildfire in wilderness areas to be left alone to burn itself out naturally. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to review Federal policy for wildfire-prone areas and develop a new fire policy for the National Park System."
