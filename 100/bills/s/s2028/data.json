    "text": "Oil Pipeline Regulatory Reform Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act (regarding oil pipeline transportation rates) to declare that oil pipelines are common carriers obligated to: (1) provide transportation service without undue discrimination; and (2) provide reasonable routes and facilities. Prohibits an oil pipeline from: (1) charging shippers different compensation for like services; or (2) subjecting a person, place, port, or type of traffic to undue discrimination. Cites circumstances under which differences between rates, classification, rules, and practices do not constitute a violation of the discrimination prohibition. Declares that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the Commission) may only initiate an investigation upon the complaint of an interested person (not upon its own motion). Prescribes guidelines for complaint processing. Directs the Commission to investigate any complaint upon State request. Prescribes enforcement guidelines. Authorizes the Commission to establish through routes for oil pipeline transportation. Prescribes guidelines under which the Commission is authorized to investigate new pipeline rates, classifications, or practices upon the complaint of an interested person. (Prohibits the Commission from initiating such an investigation upon its own motion.) Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to transfer from the Secretary of Energy to the Commission certain functions relating to oil pipeline transportation. Prohibits State regulation of oil pipeline rates or practices. Continues the applicability of antitrust laws to oil pipelines."
