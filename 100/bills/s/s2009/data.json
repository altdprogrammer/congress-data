    "text": "Federal Child Care and Child Development Coordination Act of 1988 - Title I: National Council on Children's Issues - Establishes the National Council on Children's Issues. Includes among the Council's functions coordinating Federal programs affecting children and serving as an advocate for children. Requires Federal agencies to report to the Council. Requires the Council to report annually to the President. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for FY 1988. Title II: Child Care Grant Program - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States for authorized child care program activities. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1989 through 1992. Sets forth allotment provisions. Sets forth entities which are eligible providers of child care for purposes of this title. Allows such grants to be used to: (1) provide child care services to low- and moderate-income parents, with appropriate fee schedules; (2) establish and operate neighborhood child care centers, after school child care programs and provide the startup cost of onsite child care offered by small business concerns; (3) establish programs to recruit and train senior citizens as child care workers; (4) assist eligible providers and family-based child care providers to meet State licensing standards; and (5) coordinate programs assisted under this title with child care programs operated or assisted by the State and with federally-assisted child care programs, including specified types of programs, so as to increase the hours of operation for such services. Sets forth requirements for State plans for use of grant funds. Sets forth application requirements for eligible providers to receive grants from States under this title. Requires State agencies to evaluate projects under this title and report to the Secretary, who shall summarize such evaluations for the Congress.
