Directs the Administrator to enter into a similar arrangement with another nonprofit scientific entity if the Academy is not willing to conduct such review and prepare the required report. Prohibits the Administrator from obligating any funds for use by another nonprofit scientific entity until specifically authorized to do so by a law enacted after the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Administrator, no later than October 1, 1988, to transmit to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees a report prepared by the Academy or other appropriate entity describing the review conducted under this Act and containing a statement of their conclusions as to the human health effects of exposure to agent orange and its compounds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 to carry out this Act."
