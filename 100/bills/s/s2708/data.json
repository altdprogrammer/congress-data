    "text": "State Sovereignty and Wilderness Evaluation Act of 1988 - Title I: State Sovereignty - Permits any State in which more than 25 percent of the land is owned by the United States (including land held in trust for Indians or Indian tribes) to submit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House a notice of disapproval of the designation of a wilderness area. Provides that the designation of a wilderness area shall take effect at the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of such designation unless, during such 90-day period, the State in which such area is located submits a notice of disapproval. Sets forth provisions with respect to the management of such areas: (1) during the 90-day period; (2) after the submission of a notice of disapproval; and (3) in the absence of a congressional override. Permits the Congress, by joint resolution, to override a notice of disapproval if: (1) the joint resolution specifically overrides the notice of disapproval; and (2) the joint resolution is passed by the Congress within 90 days of the date on which the State's notice of disapproval is first received. Title II: Wilderness Evaluation - Requires the Comptroller General, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, to initiate an evaluation of the effect of past wilderness designation on the natural resources of wilderness lands, the national and local economics, and the extent of subsequent public use of such lands, especially recreational use. Requires the results of such evaluation to be submitted, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. Sets forth the contents of such evaluation."
