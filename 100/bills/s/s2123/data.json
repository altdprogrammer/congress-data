    "text": "Emergency Hunger Relief Act of 1988 - Title I: Family Self Sufficiency Improvement - Subtitle A: Food Stamp Program - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to increase the minimum food stamp program (program) allotments by one percent for the period January 1, 1989, through September 30, 1989, and by one percent during FY 1990. Amends the definition of \"household\" to repeal the provision providing separate household status for certain parents of minor children and for such children. Makes permanent categorical program eligibility based on eligibility for specified social security programs. Provides an additional excess shelter deduction. States that: (1) households not required to submit monthly income reports shall have their income calculated on a prospective basis; and (2) households required to submit monthly income reports shall have their income calculated on a retrospective basis, except under specified circumstances. Repeals the requirement of prior approval by the Secretary of Agriculture for less than monthly income reporting of certain households. Prohibits a state agency from requiring periodic reporting of households: (1) made up entirely of migrant or seasonal farm workers; (2) made up entirely of homeless persons; or (3) with no earned income and in which all adult members are elderly or disabled. Requires that households reporting monthly be provided with clear and understandable reporting forms. Adjusts the automobile asset limitation to reflect Consumer Price Index changes. Provides full program benefits for breaks in certification of 30 days or less. Permits households subject to benefit prorating to receive an aggregate benefit allotment. Extends the scope of program informational activities. Amends the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act to make permanent the authority for homeless persons in shelters to receive food stamps. Subtitle B: Related Programs - Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, as amended by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, to extend the temporary emergency food assistance program (TEFAP) through FY 1990. Increases the amount of TEFAP funds for emergency feeding organizations. Amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to authorize appropriations through FY 1993 for the community food and nutrition program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study (through the National Academy of Sciences) of the kinds of medical problems commonly suffered by program participants and the resulting special diets; and (2) report to the Congress. Title II: Child Nutrition Promotion - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to exclude foster care and adoption assistance from program income determinations. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to increase the school breakfast program reimbursement rate by three cents per meal as of July 1, 1989. Amends the National School Lunch Act to permit specified private nonprofit organizations to participate in the summer food program. Provides an additional meal or snack to children who attend day care centers which are open more than eight hours a day. Repeals the provision tying reduced price lunch eligibility to program eligibility. Title III: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective dates for provisions of this Act."
