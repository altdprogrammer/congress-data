Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires eligible applicants to use such grants for model programs for: (1) early identification of prekindergarten children aged three and four who are at high risk of dropping out of elementary or secondary school; and (2) assisting such children to acquire cognitive and language development skills necessary to succeed in school. Sets forth application requirements. Sets the Federal share of the costs of such programs at 90 percent for the first year, 70 percent for the second year, and 50 percent for the third year. Limits to 25 percent that portion of the annual appropriations for this Act which may be used for grants to community-based organizations and nonprofit private organizations. Limits the amount of a grant to any one applicant. Requires annual evaluation of such grants program. Requires dissemination of information on the activities assisted under this Act."
