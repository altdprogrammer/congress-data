    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate", 
    "date": "1988-06-17", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 4418 passed in lieu) National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1988 - Title I: National Science Foundation Authorization - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993 to the National Science Foundation (NSF). Sets forth the following categories for which FY 1989 funds for research and related activities are to be available: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) geosciences; (5) computer and information science and engineering; (6) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (7) distributed programs, including the programs under titles IV and V of this Act; (8) Science and Technology Research Centers; and (9) program development and management. Authorizes FY 1989 funds for the following additional programs: (1) academic research facilities modernization; (2) the U.S. Antarctic Program; and (3) science and engineering education, including specified amounts for precollege programs and for College Science Instrumentation. Requires a specified percentage increase in the amounts available for science and engineering education in certain categories. Limits the amounts that may be used for consultation, representation, or other extraordinary expenses. Permits transfers of funds among categories as long as transfers do not exceed ten percent of authorized amounts. Permits transfers in excess of ten percent if specified congressional committees are given 30 days' notice in writing. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to allow portions of National Science Board meetings to be closed to the public when the Board considers possible NSF budgets for a particular fiscal year, if the President's budget for that fiscal year has not yet been submitted to the Congress. Revises provisions relating to the Executive Committee of the National Science Board. Repeals provisions that require certain oaths and statements before acceptance of NSF scholarships or fellowships and make members of Communist organizations ineligible for such scholarships or fellowships. Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization and Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to revise provisions for membership on the Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering. Requires the Committee to report biennially rather than annually. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to authorize the Director to hire, on a temporary basis, personnel on leave of absence from academic, industrial, or research institutions. Requires the NSF to encourage efforts by academic institutions and States that historically have received relatively little Federal research and development funding to improve their research programs and infrastructures. Directs the National Academy of Sciences to study and report to the Congress concerning current U.S. earthquake engineering research efforts. Provides that the mandated review of the three-year period of operation of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research be conducted by an independent review panel. Title II: Academic Research Facilities Modernization - Academic Research Facilities Modernization Act of 1988 - Instructs the NSF Director to establish and carry out a new academic research facilities modernization program, making awards to institutions of higher education for the repair, renovation, or replacement of obsolete laboratories and research facilities. Prescribes criteria for the awards and directs the Director to promulgate procedures and to conduct comprehensive planning activities in connection with implementation of the program. Requires that the resultant comprehensive program plan include provisions defining the appropriate roles and responsibilities of Federal, State, and local governments, institutions of higher education, and appropriate nongovernmental organizations with respect to research facilities. Requires the Director to submit a report containing the comprehensive plan to specified congressional committees by March 31, 1989. Mandates that at least ten percent of the funds appropriated for the program be set aside for institutions of higher education having substantial enrollments of Black, Hispanic, or Native American students in science and engineering. Title III: Undergraduate Science and Engineering Improvement Program - Undergraduate Science and Engineering Improvement Act of 1988 - Directs the NSF to implement a comprehensive Undergraduate Science and Engineering Improvement Program, granting awards to institutions of higher education for projects designed to improve the state of undergraduate science and engineering education. Title IV: College and University Innovation Research Program - College and University Innovation Research Program Act of 1988 - Instructs the NSF Director to establish a five-year pilot program, modeled after the Small Business Innovation Research Program, to make grants and provide forgivable loans to eligible faculty members for scientific research, in the interest of developing prototype inventions and processes with economic potential. Makes awards available in the following phases: (1) Phase I, to fund exploratory research; (2) Phase II, to provide additional funding to advance any new technology, product, or service; and (3) Phase III (not NSF funded) to support research and development to create new domestically-produced products, processes, and services. Sunsets operating authority for the program five years after this Act's enactment. Requires the Director to: (1) establish within the NSF the College and University Innovation Research Program Revolving Fund to finance the program and to receive monies recouped under the program of forgivable loans; and (2) submit to the Congress both an initial and a follow-up report describing and assessing the program under this title. Title V: Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research - Authorizes and directs the NSF Director to continue to operate the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to assist States that have historically received relatively little Federal research and development funding and have demonstrated a commitment to improve their higher education science and engineering research programs. Permits second awards to States under the program and authorizes the Director to engage in additional activities to improve participating States' research bases and competitive potential. Directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to report to the Congress, not later than November 1, 1988, on desalination research and technology."
