Provides that any such costs and fees shall be paid by the Corporation, by the recipient, or by the attorney, as determined by the Court. (Current law provides for: (1) the awarding of such costs and fees only where the action was pursued to harass the defendant or where the Corporation or recipient abused legal process; and (2) the payment of such costs and fees by the Corporation.)"
