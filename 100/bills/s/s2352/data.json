Adjusts certain boundaries of the Coronado National Forest. Authorizes appropriations, including to provide for at least ten full-time equivalent employees of the BLM to perform resource management and law enforcement activities as a part of the administration of: (1) certain lands transferred from the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge to the BLM under this Act; and (2) BLM lands in the Black Canyon Corridor."
