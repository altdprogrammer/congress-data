    "text": "Business Incubator Review Act of 1988 - Declares it to be U.S. policy that the Federal Government should encourage the development and operation of business incubators as an economic development tool. Directs the President to create a Business Incubator Review Group, including certain cabinet officers and other appropriate individuals, to review Federal policies and programs relating to business incubators and to report to appropriate congressional committees describing current programs and recommending improvements and changes. Terminates the Group 30 days after submission of the required report. Directs Group members to review business development regulations promulgated by their respective agencies and to take action to assure that business incubators are eligible for relevant grants and loans. Instructs the Secretary of Commerce, through the Clearinghouse for State and Local Initiatives on Productivity, Technology, and Innovation, to study and report to appropriate congressional committees on business incubators, including descriptions of State and local programs. Authorizes appropriations for this undertaking. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to assign to the Clearinghouse for State and Local Initiatives on Productivity, Technology, and Innovation the duty to collect information on Federal programs supporting business incubators and to assist and advise State and local governments with respect to such programs."
