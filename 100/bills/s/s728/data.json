Requires reexamination of such separate household status at least every six months. Defines \"homeless individual\" as a person: (1) who lacks a fixed nighttime residence; and (2) whose primary nighttime residence is a supervised temporary shelter, institution, temporary accommodation in another's residence, or a place not ordinarily used for sleeping. Authorizes food stamp outreach for the homeless. Requires States to provide food stamps within five days of application to: (1) the homeless; and (2) persons whose combined gross income and liquid resources are less than their monthly rent and utilities. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement certain vendor payment provisions within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Title II: Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) - Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to provide for an increased variety of commodities for distribution under the temporary emergency food assistance (TEFAP) program. Increases FY 1987 TEFAP authorizations. Authorizes FY 1988 program authorizations. Title III: Effective Date - Makes the provisions of this Act, with stated exceptions, effective not later than 160 days after enactment."
