Authorizes the Secretary of Labor (current law authorizes the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor) to make regulations and orders regulating and restricting industrial homework. Provides that the Secretary may not make any regulation or order under the Act that would prohibit an individual from engaging in homework as an employee of an employer subject to the Act, except that the Secretary may make such an order with respect to an individual employer found to be in violation of the Act. Directs the Secretary, within one year after enactment of this Act and each year thereafter, to report to the Congress on: (1) the impact on industries and employers of the Secretary's regulations and restrictions on industrial homework; and (2) the economic effect on industries and employees of permitting industrial homework."
