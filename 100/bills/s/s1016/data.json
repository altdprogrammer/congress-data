Permits funds under this Act to be used for grants to institutions of higher education for: (1) the costs of their participation in the literacy corps program; and (2) stipends for student coordinators engaged in the literacy corps program. Permits such funds to also be used for technical assistance, collection and dissemination of information, and evaluation. Sets forth grant application requirements. Requires the institution to establish one or more courses for instruction for academic credit designed to combine the training of undergraduate students with experience as tutors. Requires individuals, as a condition of receiving credit in such course, to perform at least six hours of voluntary, uncompensated service each week of the academic term in a public community agency as a tutor in such agency's educational or literacy program. Sets forth provisions for technical assistance and coordination contracts. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989."
