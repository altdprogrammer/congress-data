Requires that Federal policies, regulations, and public laws be interpreted and administered in accordance with this Act. Directs Federal agencies to use reliable demographic, natural resource, and environmental information in planning and decisionmaking and to assist State and local governments in efforts to balance population, resources, and environmental quality. Requires Federal agencies to act to eliminate any deficient or inconsistent policy which limits or prevents compliance with this Act. Directs the agencies to recommend to the President and the Congress any administrative or legislative action deemed necessary. Requires the President, within three years of enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on: (1) the current and foreseeable trends in national and global population size and age structure, including annual figures on population increases or decreases in each nation and the level of net migration into the United States; (2) an evaluation of the adequacy of available natural resources to fulfill population requirements; (3) an evaluation of the short-term and long-term impact that such trends will have on the economy and national security of the United States; (4) a review of the effects of Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, programs, and activities on the attainment of national and global population stabilization; (5) a detailed demographic analysis of population growth, losses, or shifts in different regions of the United States and their impact on the economy, natural resources, environmental quality, and the provision of public services; (6) any destabilizing impacts which population growth and shifts may have on other nations, particularly the developing nations; (7) a summary of the findings of agency policy reviews; and (8) recommendations or legislative actions considered necessary."
