Establishes in the Treasury the National Organ Transplant Trust Fund and appropriates to it amounts equal to those designated on tax returns. Establishes a program through which Trust Fund monies will be used to pay the costs of organ transplantation procedures and immunosuppressive drugs for individuals deemed unable to pay for a reasonably medically necessary transplant procedure. Authorizes, in addition, the use of Fund monies to pay the costs of notifying potential beneficiaries about the Trust Fund, and for other administrative expenses, including the solicitation of contributions."
