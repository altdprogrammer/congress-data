Requires the transfer to the Senate or appropriate Senate committee of all information that is transferred to the President in the course of such investigation relating to any person nominated to be: (1) the head of certain departments; (2) Chief Justice, associate justice, circuit judge, or district judge; and (3) an officer of the United States who is required to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Provides that this Act does not apply to any person nominated to be an ambassador or an officer in the military or foreign service. Prohibits cabinet-level officials, the Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, or Navy and the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget, the Central Intelligence Agency, or the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from continuing service during a succeeding presidential term unless such persons are reappointed to such positions by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."
