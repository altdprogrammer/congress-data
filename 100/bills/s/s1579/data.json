Rept. 100-1055) Title I: Revisions and Extension of Certain Programs with Respect to Preventive Health and Health Services - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991 for preventive health and health services block grants. Amends provisions specifying the uses for such grants to include grants related to elevated serum cholesterol, chronic diseases, immunization services, communications equipment for emergency medical services systems, and uterine and breast cancer. Requires that the annual application mandated by current law include a statement of the public health objectives expected to be achieved through the use of the payments. Specifies additional information and evaluations which must be included in the annual report mandated by current law. Allows grants for demonstration projects for emergency medical services for children to be for not more than a two-year period, subject to annual evaluation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. (Current law limits such grants to a one-year period and makes no reference to an evaluation.) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Repeals provisions authorizing the Secretary to make grants to States with regard to: (1) health information and health promotion; and (2) identification of needs for block grants relating to preventive health and health services. Title II: Revision and Extension of Certain Programs with Respect to Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Health Information, and Health Promotion - Revises provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to grants concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted diseases. Authorizes appropriations for sexually transmitted disease projects and programs for FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991 to carry out the provisions of title XVII (Health Information and Health Promotion) of the Public Health Service Act. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act, to develop model programs through which employers in the public sector and employers that are small businesses can provide for their employees a program to promote healthful behaviors and discourage unhealthful behaviors. Directs the Secretary to provide related technical assistance. Title III: General Provisions - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
