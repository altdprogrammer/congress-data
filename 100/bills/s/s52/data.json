Prescribes guidelines for such implementation, including: (1) taking action to assure an effective cooperative effort in furtherance of the Program; (2) taking administrative and financial measures to assure the effective functioning of the Interagency Accord on Continental Scientific Drilling; (3) assuring the continuing operation of the Interagency Coordinating Group; and (4) assuring that the Interagency Coordinating Group receives appropriate Federal agency cooperation. Requires a report to the Congress within 180 days of enactment describing: (1) policy objectives; (2) projected schedules of scientific and engineering events that would advance Program objectives; (3) resources and funding levels for FY 1989 that would be required by each participating Federal agency to implement projected schedules of events and Program policy objectives; and (4) cooperation with the international community. Requires the Interagency Coordinating Group to submit annually a report describing the resources and funding levels needed for the next fiscal year (beginning one year after submission of the policy objectives report)."
