Title II: Management of Coastal Plain - Declares that it is congressional policy that oil and gas activities on the Coastal Plain which are conducted with no significant adverse impact upon fish, wildlife, and the environment shall be deemed compatible with the purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and that no further compatibility findings by the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) are required under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Title III: Coastal Plain Competitive Leasing Program - Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for Coastal Plain resources exploration, development, and production. Declares that this Act is the sole authority for leasing on the Coastal Plain. Directs the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations to implement this Act. Declares that the Congress finds that the \"Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement\" (April 1987) on the Coastal Plain satisfies the legal requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Sets forth the administrative parameters for: (1) lease sales and lease terms; (2) exploration and development and production plans; (3) plan approval; (4) bonding requirements; and (5) lease suspension and cancellation.

Prohibits any surface disturbance prior to the publication of final environmental regulations for Coastal Plain oil or gas leasing. Applies such regulations to subsurface property interests owned by the Inupiat Eskimo. Title IV: Coastal Plain Environmental Protection - Directs the Secretary to promulgate environmental protection regulations which ensure that Coastal Plain activities will result in no significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and the environment. Requires site-specific assessment and mitigation. Designates the Sadlerochit Spring area as a special area for wildlife conservation and environmental protection. Authorizes the Secretary to exclude such area from leasing and to designate other Coastal Plain areas as special areas requiring protection. Directs the Secretary to prepare and periodically update a facilities construction and siting plan for oil and gas development and transportation. Authorizes the Secretary to grant rights-of-way and easements across the Coastal Plain in a manner that does not adversely affect fish, wildlife, and the environment.

Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations providing for bi-annual facility inspections for compliance with environmental and safety regulations. Title V: Land Reclamation and Reclamation Liability Fund - Makes leaseholders fully responsible and liable for land reclamation within the Coastal Plain and other Federal lands adversely affected by lease activities. Requires establishment of the Coastal Plain Liability and Reclamation Fund within six months of a commercial discovery within the Coastal Plain, to be administered by the holder of the trans-Alaska pipeline right-of-way, who shall collect fees based upon the crude oil volume entering such pipeline. Prescribes revenue collection and expenditure procedures. Title VI: Disposition of Oil and Gas Revenues - Sets forth an allocation schedule for revenue distribution related to oil and gas leasing within the Arctic National Refuge, Alaska. Mandates that moneys deposited into the Land and Water Conservation Fund shall be credited to a special account within the Fund. Prescribes the administration of such Fund. Title VII: Approval of Conveyances in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - Precludes conveyance by the Secretary of any Arctic National Wildlife Refuge land interests within the Coastal Plain without prior approval by an Act of Congress.

Outlines the contents of such plan. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transmit to the Congress within 15 months after the date of enactment of this Act a study of present and projected offshore and onshore oil and gas developments in the Alaska Arctic region. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from conducting first lease sales under this Act until 21 months after its date of enactment. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an Energy Research and Demonstration Grant Program in the areas of energy conservation and alternative energy sources whose focus shall be energy technologies which can significantly reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil. Title X: Export Prohibition on Crude Oil - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to extend its crude oil export limitations and licensing requirements to domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted under this Act."
