    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 2616 passed in lieu) Omnibus Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1987 - Title I: Compensation and Other Benefits - Part A: Compensation and Related Cost-of-Living Adjustments - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to direct the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to increase the rates of veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation by the same percentage (4.2 percent) as that which is to be provided to Social Security recipients and Veterans Administration (VA) pension beneficiaries as of January 1, 1988. Requires such rate increases to be published in the Federal Register. Increases the amount of payment for specially adapted housing assistance, the automobile assistance allowance, and service-connected death benefits (the burial allowance). Part B: Other Compensation-Related Provisions - Provides a presumption (for purposes of eligibility for veterans' benefits) of service-connection for former prisoners of war (POW's) who suffer from peripheral neuropathy, irritable bowel syndrome, or peptic ulcer disease, if the disabilities become ten percent or more disabling. Reduces from six months to 90 days the period of internment required to establish eligibility for outpatient dental care by the VA. Provides for the inclusion of systemic lupus erythematosus among the chronic diseases that are presumed to be service-connected if manifest to a disabling degree of ten percent or more within one year of the veterans' discharge from active service. Extends eligibility for certain Social Security-equivalent benefits to those survivors receiving benefits under the Reinstated Entitlement Program for Survivors (REPS) rather than under the Social Security Act. Exempts from any sequestration order provided under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 the VA's program of rehabilitation services for certain service-connected disabled veterans and the educational assistance program for survivors of veterans who die from service-connected causes or whose death occurred while rated as totally and permanently disabled, as well as dependents of veterans whose disability is currently rated as total and permanent. Requires the VA to contract, subject to the availability of appropriations, for a comprehensive review to be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or by an alternative appropriate scientific entity, of all scientific evidence, studies, and literature pertaining to the human health effects of exposure to agent orange and its component compounds. Requires such contract to be entered into no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. Requires the Administrator, no later than October 1, 1988, to transmit to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (the veterans' committees) a report on the results of such review. Part C: Education Provisions - Revises the standard for evaluating the training time of VA students enrolled in courses with laboratory instruction. Extends the delimiting period for educational assistance for members of the all-volunteer force for certain veterans and other eligible persons who have been prevented from using such entitlements as a result of alcohol or drug dependence or abuse conditions. Defines an alcohol or drug dependence or abuse condition for purposes of the extension. Requires an individual so affected to file an application for such benefits within a specified period, and to then utilize such extended benefits within a specified period not to exceed four years from the date of such extension. Makes identical delimiting period extensions for: (1) programs of rehabilitation for veterans with service-connected disabilities; (2) educational assistance for post-Vietnam era veterans; (3) educational assistance for Vietnam-era veterans; and (4) educational assistance for veterans' survivors and dependents. Authorizes the Administrator to waive required annual educational institution compliance surveys when an institution has a demonstrated record of compliance with all veterans' education requirements. Requires that the effective dates for the award of benefits under the Post-Vietnam Era Education Assistance Program correspond, to the extent feasible, with the effective dates of awards of VA disability compensation. Repeals the VA's authority to make education loans in the form of accelerated payment of educational assistance allowances. Part D: Insurance Provisions - Amends Federal veterans' life insurance provisions to authorize the Administrator to increase periodically the amount of monthly annuity payments to beneficiaries under the following policies: (1) National Service Life Insurance; (2) Veterans Special Life Insurance; (3) Veterans Reopened Insurance; and (4) United States Government Life Insurance. Prohibits any State from imposing taxes on any premiums paid under a Serviceman's Group Life Insurance or under a Veterans' Group Life Insurance policy. Authorizes the Administrator to administer directly the Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance program. Part E: Pension Provision - Excludes reimbursement for property loss (from any source) from the beneficiary's income as used by the VA in determining eligibility for, and rates of, pension payments and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation. Title II: Veterans' Radiation Exposure - Veterans' Radiation Exposure Disability and Death Benefits Act of 1987 - Sets forth findings, includidng the following: (1) a significant portion of the veterans present at nuclear detonations were exposed to ionizing radiation which was measured by what proved to be an inaccurate method of determining the amount of such dosage; (2) the present process of adjudicating claims by veterans based on such radiation exposure has not resulted in fair resolution of such claims, due in part to the inaccurate measurement of health risk caused by such radiation dosages; and (3) certain body organs have shown a high susceptibility to the induction of cancers by ionizing radiation, creating a much higher possibility of cancer in various organs and areas of the body. Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to provide either a monthly disability or a monthly death benefit to a veteran who has died or is suffering from a disease based on the Government's testing of nuclear weapons or on the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Specifies the diseases based on such radiation exposure for which such benefits shall be paid, requiring manifestation of such disease within a specified period following exposure to such ionizing radiation. Bases the rates of compensation to be paid on the rates of compensation for service-connected death or disability benefits. Requires the Administrator to give special consideration to claims for compensation or dependency or indemnity compensation based on such radiation exposure and involving specific forms of cancer manifesting themselves within five years after exposure. Denies the payment of any such benefits when there is affirmative evidence that the disease was not incurred as a result of the veteran's exposure to testing or involvement in the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Treats any benefits paid under this Act as service-connected benefits for purposes of the applicability of other veterans' benefits provisions. Defines a veteran's estimated service-related radiation exposure for purposes of adjudicating a claim for benefits provided under this Act. Amends the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act to require a certain advisory committee's report concerning the possible adverse effects resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation to be forwarded to the House and Senate veterans' committees. Makes the deadline for application for benefits under this Act and the eligibility for VA health care for radiation-exposed veterans September 30, 1991.

Directs that the NRC conduct a crash test and a drop test involving such a container, and that the NRC certify such container as safe for the transport of such plutonium. Requires such tests to be designed by the NRC after public notice and after reasonable opportunity for public comment on the design of such tests. Requires the results of all such tests to be: (1) available to the public; and (2) submitted to the Congress. Title III: Health Care - Part A: Health-Care Programs - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to authorize the VA, in the case of veterans who request such services, to furnish procreation-aid services in cases where the veteran's service-connected disability impairs the veteran's ability to procreate. Authorizes the VA to contract with non-VA health-care entities to provide emergency hospital care for veterans being furnished nursing home care in the community at VA expense, and to provide inpatient or outpatient observation and examination of veterans to determine eligibility for VA benefits. Amends the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1979 to conform certain reporting requirements contained under such Act to changes made in the VA's contract authorities by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). Allows the VA to furnish to any eligible veteran residing or sojourning abroad: (1) hospital care or medical services for a service-connected disability; or (2) vocational rehabilitation for a service-connected disability. Revises current eligibility criteria for VA domiciliary care to provide eligibility to persons in need of such care who either have a service-connected disability or have no adequate means of support. Requires the VA to conduct, from January 1, 1988, to December 31, 1991, a four-year pilot program at not less than five nor more than ten demonstration project sites to evaluate noninstitutional alternatives to institutional care.

Places certain limitations on the authority of the Administrator to prescribe limitations on the furnishing of health care services to veterans, except during periods of national or regional emergency. Increases the per-diem rates for the care of veterans in State homes, authorizing the Administrator to increase such rates by the percentage increase in the cost of care in VA general hospitals. Makes technical adjustments to provisions of current Federal law establishing a priority for the awarding of State home construction grants. Precludes per-diem payments made by the VA to State veterans' homes from being considered a \"third-party liability\" under the Medicaid program, and therefore, being deducted from medicaid payments to State homes.

Authorizes the Administrator to provide, or assist in the provision of, rehabilitative recreational activities to disabled veterans.

Outlines administrative provisions concerning the establishment of such centers, requiring the Administrator to prescribe regulations to carry out such provision. Subpart 2: Other Medical Administration Matters - Repeals a provision of current Federal law which authorizes the Administrator to furnish tobacco to hospitalized veterans. Revises the period of time during which the VA may institute legal action to recover the cost of VA health care in certain circumstances. Expands the immunity from liability for VA health-care employees to include under such immunity any negligent or wrongful act committed by such employees while in the scope of their employment (making the Federal Government liable for such acts instead of the individual employees). Authorizes the Administrator to settle administrative tort claims in an amount equal to the amount of settlement authority which the Attorney General provides to a U.S. Attorney. Replaces the current Veterans' Affairs Committees approval resolutions process for VA major medical construction or acquisition projects with a specified legislative authorization process. Replaces the existing prohibition against increasing the contract amount by more than ten percent of the amount specified by the Committees' resolution process with a requirement that the Administrator give the veterans' committees 30 days' advance notice whenever the cost of a project would exceed by more than ten percent the amount specified in the authorizing legislation.
