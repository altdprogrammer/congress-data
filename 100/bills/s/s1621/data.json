Increases the threshold amount of a Federal contract covered by such Act from $2,000 to $100,000 or, in the case of Department of Defense contracts, $1,000,000. Provides that helpers of a class of laborers or mechanics shall be considered as a separate class, with their prevailing wages to be determined on the basis of the corresponding class of helpers. Authorizes the Secretary, in making a wage determination, to limit the use of helpers employed at a particular site."
