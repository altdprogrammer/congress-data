Rept. 100-556) Amends the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 and other Federal civil rights law to provide that a judicial official (includes both State and Federal judges) shall not be liable for any costs, including attorney fees, or injunctive relief in any proceeding brought against the official for an act or omission committed in his or her judicial capacity. Creates an exception if the action was clearly in excess of the official's jurisdiction or, in the case of injunctive relief, if a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. Prohibits a Federal court from issuing an injunctive or declaratory order against a State judicial officer for an act or omission committed in the official's judicial capacity unless there is no adequate remedy in State court and there is imminent danger of irreparable harm to the petitioner."
