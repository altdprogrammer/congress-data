Permits an income tax deduction for self-employed individuals in the amount of their contributions to group health plans that are not self-insured and that provide medical benefits to employees. Requires: (1) an eligible plan to benefit all employees not covered by another group health plan: and (2) that at least half of the plan participants not be self-employed individuals or employee family members of such individuals."
