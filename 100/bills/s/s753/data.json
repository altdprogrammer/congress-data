    "text": "Independent Counsel Amendments Act of 1987 - Makes the statute regarding independent counsels permanent law. Authorizes the Attorney General to investigate a person subject to such statute when the Attorney General receives information that such person may have violated a Federal criminal law other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction. (Current law requires an investigation if such person has violated a criminal law other than the type described.) Authorizes the Attorney General to conduct a preliminary investigation on an additional person or matter referred from the independent counsel if such person or matter is not covered in the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel. Authorizes the reimbursement of reasonable attorney's fees (current law simply says \"attorney's fees\") to certain subjects of an investigation. Requires determinations or applications for appointment of an independent counsel to be made by the Deputy Attorney General if the information or allegations involve the Attorney General or a person who has a personal or financial relationship with the Attorney General."
