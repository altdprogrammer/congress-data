    "text": "Export Administration Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to exclude China from the definition of \"controlled country\" for purposes of such Act. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to grant a general license for exports to qualified foreign parties that the Secretary has certified as having a high expectation of being reliable end users. Defines qualified foreign parties to include Government entities from countries that have agreed to maintain export controls. Prohibits any fee from being charged in connection with the submission or processing of an export license application. Declares that no permission to reexport any goods, technologies, or services subject to U.S. jurisdiction may be required: (1) for shipment to an end user in any country which maintains export controls pursuant to a specified international agreement (except for certain highly critical goods, technologies, or services that are unilaterally controllable by the United States); or (2) from any country when the goods, technologies, or services to be reexported are incorporated in other products and no license is required for the export of either the incorporated material or the products into which they are incorporated, the value of the U.S. content of such products is 35 percent or less, or the goods are normal and usual replacements for U.S. origin components in a legally exported foreign made product and do not exceed the value of the U.S. content in the product. Prohibits requiring permission to export to any country other than a controlled country (under the national security export control provisions) of any goods or technology which, were it made in China on March 1, 1987, would require only notification of participating governments of the group known as the Coordinating Committee. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to require notification of the Department of Commerce of such exports. Requires the Secretary to issue an export license for the export to China of any good on the Commodity Control List for exhibition at a trade show if the exhibitor adheres to specified conditions. Imposes a timetable for responses by the Secretary to allegations of foreign availability by export license applicants. Requires the Secretary to publish any assessment of such foreign availability. Requires the Secretary to conduct regular reviews of the performance level of goods or technology below which exports to China require only notification of participating governments. Prohibits entering into international agreements under which export restrictions do not apply equally to goods or technology both of U.S. origin and of non-U.S. origin. Sets forth the conditions under which national security export controls may be imposed on goods containing embedded or incorporated microprocessors. Adds provisions covering West-West foreign availability of controlled goods or technology. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a validated export license for the export of goods or technology that the Secretary has determined are available in fact from sources outside the United States if the goods or technology do not exceed the technical parameters of those available from sources outside the United States to any country to which the source country does not place controls on such exports. Sets forth the procedures for obtaining a license for the export of such goods or technology. Imposes a timetable for responses by the Secretary to allegations of West-West foreign availability. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees whenever the Secretary determines that such foreign availability does not exist. Provides for interagency cooperation in determinations of foreign availability. Declares that the President, before imposing export controls for foreign policy reasons, should choose diplomatic alternatives to export controls which offer opportunities of distinguishing the United States from, and expressing U.S. displeasure with, specific actions of foreign nations. Authorizes (current law requires) forfeiture of certain property by persons convicted of violating a national security export control. Sets forth factors the Secretary shall consider in determining whether to impose a civil penalty for such violations. Provides for judicial review of civil penalties imposed by the Secretary and of orders by the Secretary that temporarily deny a person export privileges. Amends the International Economic Powers Act to require the President, in exercising emergency powers, to take only those actions which will have an adverse impact on the country or countries that are the source of the threat which precipitated the declaration of national emergency. Requires the President to try to avoid taking actions whose primary impact is on U.S. citizens or their property. Authorizes the President, in exercising emergency powers, only to prohibit or control the export of U.S. goods or technology in accordance with procedures contained in a specified section of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Deletes \"foreign policy\" as a basis for declaring a national emergency."
