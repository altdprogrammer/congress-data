Directs the Secretary, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on the implementation of such arrangements. Directs the Secretary, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on the impact upon living marine resources of the United States of all driftnet fishing in the North Pacific Ocean off the coasts of the United States both inside and outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the Secretary of State, to initiate negotiations with foreign governments regarding arrangements on enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to driftnet fishing vessels. Directs the Secretary to implement a net bounty system to pay persons recovering and turning over to the Secretary lost, abandoned, or discarded driftnet or other plastic fishing net material. Requires such payments to be made from the Fishery Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund. Directs the Secretary to develop recommendations to establish a driftnet marking, registry, and identification system to determine the vessel origin of lost, discarded, or abandoned driftnets or driftnet fragments. Directs the Secretary, no later than six months after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress concerning such recommendations and their implementation."
