Makes the United States liable for damages resulting from a search or seizure conducted by a law enforcement officer acting within the scope of employment in violation of the fourth amendment. Permits recovery of actual and punitive damages not exceeding $25,000. Authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney fees. Limits recovery of a person convicted of an offense for which evidence was illegally seized to actual physical personal injury and property damages. Makes such remedy the exclusive civil remedy for a violation of the fourth amendment to the Constitution. Authorizes a Federal agency to discipline an officer who conducts an illegal search or seizure upon a determination, after notice and hearing, that the officer lacked a good faith belief that the search or seizure was constitutional."
