    "date": "1988-08-01", 
    "text": "Veterans' Agent Orange and Vietnam Service Disabilities Act of 1988 - Title I: Agent Orange Presumptions, Research, and Outreach Matters - Creates a presumption that, for the purposes of wartime disability compensation for Vietnam veterans, the following diseases shall be considered to have been incurred in, or aggravated by, active military, naval, or air service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era: (1) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; (2) soft-tissue sarcoma; and (3) a disease that is determined by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to be reasonably associated with the known biological effects of dioxin or other toxic herbicides used in Vietnam and that is listed in regulations which the Administrator of Veterans Affairs shall prescribe for purposes of this Act. Provides that Vietnam veterans who have diseases that are associated with such herbicides shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service unless: (1) the results of credible laboratory tests indicate that the level of dioxin or other toxic agent in the veteran's serum is within the range of levels considered normal for veterans who served during the Vietnam era but did not serve in Vietnam; and (2) the service records of any such veteran indicate that the veteran did not participate extensively in tactical operations in Vietnam. Provides that such presumption is otherwise non-rebuttable. Authorizes the Administrator, for purposes of this Act, to require a veteran to submit to a blood test to determine the level of dioxin or other toxic agent in such veteran's serum. Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or another appropriate nonprofit private scientific organization to determine the normal range of serum dioxin or other toxic agent levels. Authorizes the Administrator to apply the presumption that diseases associated with toxic agents in veterans who were exposed to such agents in Vietnam were incurred or aggravated by such service, to veterans who served actively outside of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and were exposed to such agents. Requires the Administrator to enter into an agreement with an appropriate nonprofit private scientific organization to: (1) conduct a survey of all scientific studies of the effects of dioxin and other toxic agents in herbicides used by the United States in Vietnam on humans or animals; and (2) determine which (if any) diseases are reasonably associated with the known biological effects of exposure to dioxin or other such agents on humans and appropriate animal models. Designates the NAS as the appropriate nonprofit organization, unless: (1) the NAS does not enter into such an agreement with the Administrator; (2) the Administrator has notified the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees of an alternative organization; and (3) 90 days have elapsed since such notification. Directs such organization, within one year after enactment of this Act, to report to the Administrator and the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees the name of each disease reasonably associated with the known biological effects of exposure to dioxin and other such agents and the biological basis for the association of such disease with such effects. Requires the Administrator, within 90 days of receipt of such report, to determine which diseases (if any) are associated with such exposure and to prescribe regulations listing each such disease. Directs the Administrator to periodically (but not less than annually) survey additional completed studies and to enter into an agreement with such organization to conduct a survey to determine whether any of the previous determinations regarding such diseases should be modified and whether any diseases should be added to the list. Requires that the Administrator: (1) compile and analyze, on a continuing basis, all clinical data obtained by the VA in connection with physical examinations and treatment furnished after November 3, 1981, to veterans who were exposed to dioxin or any other such toxic substance; and (2) submit to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees a semiannual report containing such compilation and analysis, along with a discussion of the disabilities identified or treated by the VA, the Administrator's explanation for the incidence of such disabilities, and other reasonable explanations for the incidence of such disabilities. Directs the Administrator to establish and maintain a system for the collection and frozen storage of voluntarily contributed samples of blood and tissue of veterans who performed active service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Authorizes the Administrator to make such tissue available for studies of the feasibility of conducting research on: (1) health hazards resulting from exposure to dioxin and other toxic agents in herbicides used by the United States in Vietnam; and (2) health hazards resulting from active service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. Requires the Administrator to: (1) award contracts or furnish financial assistance to non-Government entities to carry out such studies; and (2) report the results of such studies to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees. Directs the Administrator to: (1) conduct an outreach program for furnishing to veterans of active service in Vietnam services and information relating to health risks resulting from exposure to dioxin or other toxic agents used in herbicides during the Vietnam era; (2) update information on veterans contained in the Veterans Administration Agent Orange Registry; and (3) organize the information in such registry to enable the Administrator promptly to notify a veteran of any increased health risk resulting from such exposure. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, to report to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees on the research being conducted to develop treatments for physiological absorption of dioxin and other toxic agents used in herbicides by the United States in Vietnam, including research relating exposure to dioxin and other toxic agents outside Vietnam. Makes funds appropriated for the Centers for Disease Control available to carry out this Act. Title II: Advisory Committee on Special Studies Relating to the Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Phenoxy Herbicides and Contaminants - Requires at least one-third of the members of the Advisory Committee on Special Studies Relating to the Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Phenoxy Herbicides and Contaminants to be individuals selected by the Secretary from scientists recommended by veterans organizations. Prohibits any Federal officer or employee from serving as Chairman of the Committee. Requires the Secretary of Defense, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, to transmit to specified House and Senate committees a schedule of reports on the Ranch Hand study and other studies conducted by the Department of Defense. Provides that each schedule shall require at least two progress reports each year and a final report. Directs the Secretary to submit such reports to such committees."
