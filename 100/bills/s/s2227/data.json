    "text": "Ouachita National Forest Quartz Mineral Leasing Act - Provides that all lands to be leased for quartz mineral within the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, shall be leased to the highest bidder under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture for lease issuance. Requires competitive leasing by the Secretary of the Interior under the same conditions applied to leases for hardrock minerals under specified law. States that this Act does not apply to valid quartz mineral mining claims for which a patent application has been filed and all patent requirements have been complied with by a specified date. Deems failure to file a patent application within such time period as an abandonment of the quartz mineral claim. Declares that after March 29, 1988, quartz mineral deposits within the Ouachita National Forest shall no longer be subject to location and entry under the General Mining Law of 1872."
