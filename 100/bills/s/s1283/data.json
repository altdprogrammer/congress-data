    "text": "Medicaid Catastrophic Coverage for Children Act of 1987 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to cover individuals: (1) who have not attained age 21; (2) who have an acute and chronic disabling mental or physical condition; and (3) whose family has incurred expenses for medical or remedial care for the year which are equal to the lesser of ten percent of the family's countable income or $10,000. Raises such expense limits to 12 percent of the family's countable income or $13,000 where the family has more than one eligible child. Requires that the full Medicaid benefit package be made available to such individuals without the imposition of durational or numerical limitations on physicians' services or inpatient or outpatient hospital services. Requires that benefits be provided to each individual pursuant to a plan of care which is established and periodically reviewed by a multidisciplinary care coordination team. Bases such plans on the early and periodic screening and diagnosis of eligible individuals. Sets the Federal medical assistance percentage with respect to care provided to such individuals at 90 percent. Prohibits States from raising their Medicaid eligibility standards or curtailing Medicaid services after May 26, 1987. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a continuing study over the five-year period during which this Act's program remains effective (from October 1987 through September 1992) of individuals receiving assistance under such program and the cost-effectiveness and socioeconomic implications of the program. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress annual reports regarding such study and final recommendations by April 1, 1992, regarding the feasibility and desirability of extending the program."
