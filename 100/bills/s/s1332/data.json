    "text": "Learning Disabled Youthful Offender Rehabilitation Act of 1987 - Authorizes programs in the interest of establishing a comprehensive educational and psychosocial prevention and intervention program to reduce the recidivism rate among first-time criminal offenders who are learning disabled. Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to applicant local district attorneys to develop educational programs as an alternative to incarceration for eligible learning disabled defendants. Requires each grant application to present a program proposal that includes the following, among other guidelines and criteria: (1) a requirement that the defendant be a first-time misdemeanor offender under age 21 who has been diagnosed as having a treatable learning disability; and (2) procedures to govern local district attorneys' determination as to suitable candidates for the program. Requires that the defendant be granted a conditional deferred prosecution, plead quilty, and receive a minimum sentence of 100 hours in the educational and vocational program tailored to the defendant's needs. Provides for restoration of the case for sentence execution or further proceedings if a finding of default is filed against a defendant. Provides for issuance of a bench warrant if a defendant absconds. Authorizes grant fund use for the creation of systems to: (1) identify learning disabled individuals; and (2) hire evaluative and remedial personnel to identify and treat eligible defendants. Requires grant recipients to submit an initial report to the Attorney General (to be followed a year later by a supplemental report) with respect to specified aspects of the funded program, including the academic ability and employment success of each program participant. Authorizes appropriations."
