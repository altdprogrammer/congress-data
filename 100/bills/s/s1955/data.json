    "text": "Great Lakes Coastal Barrier Act of 1987 - Amends the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to include in the Coastal Barrier Resources System those coastal barriers of the Great Lakes that are recommended by the Secretary of the Interior to the Congress for review under the Act. Directs the Secretary to recommend to the Congress undeveloped coastal barriers along the Great Lakes that are appropriate for inclusion in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Prohibits the Secretary from recommending any area which is publicly owned and protected by Federal or State law, or held by a qualified organization primarily for wildlife refuge, sanctuary, recreational, or natural resource conservation purposes. Directs the Secretary, before making the recommendations, to consult with Federal agencies, States bordering on the Great Lakes, and the public. Gives the Congress 90 days after the Secretary submits the boundaries of the coastal barriers to review the boundaries. Declares that, after those 90 days and subject to modification by law, the barriers designated by the Secretary shall be included in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Directs the Secretary to review the System maps at least once every five years and make modifications to reflect changes occurring as a result of natural forces. Requires that reviews be made in consultation with appropriate States, coastal zone management agencies, Federal agencies, and the public. States that limitations on Federal expenditures under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act shall not apply to highways located within Michigan if the Congress adds new units to the Coastal Barrier Resources System, and those units include portions of U.S. or State highways in Michigan."
