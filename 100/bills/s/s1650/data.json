Authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to reallocate among other foreign countries the quantity of such products which could have been imported from Panama prior to the enactment of this Act. Terminates such prohibition if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) the Government of Panama has demonstrated substantial progress in the effort to assure civilian control of the armed forces and that the Panama Defense Forces and its leaders have been removed from nonmilitary activities and institutions; (2) the Government of Panama has established an independent investigation into allegations of illegal actions by members of the Panama Defense Forces; (3) a nonmilitary transitional government is in power; and (4) freedom of the press and all other constitutional guarantees to the Panamanian people are restored."
