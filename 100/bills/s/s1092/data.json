Directs the Secretary to include in such report appropriate legislative recommendations if coal imports are adversely affecting the management of the Federal coal leasing program and the economic condition of one or more sectors of the U.S. coal industry. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to impose an $8 per ton tariff on coal from countries whose coal exports to the United States historically exceed their imports from the United States. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include within the category of import-sensitive articles coal subject to the duty imposed under the Tariff Schedules of the United States."
