Grants the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts authority to contract for psychiatric aftercare. Amends the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to permit persons convicted of certain labor-related offenses to seek relief in Federal court without first attaining Justice Department consent. Eliminates the requirement that the Commission respond to defendant petitions for guideline modifications. States that, with respect to offenses committed before the effective date of the Commission's sentencing guidelines, authority to lower a sentence below a statutory minimum shall be governed by specified provisions of Federal law. Limits the term of imprisonment to be served by persons who violate their conditions of supervised release."
