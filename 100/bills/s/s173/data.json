    "text": "Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require that, upon the death of an individual who was married at least three years prior to the date of death or was divorced after at least three years of marriage, the surviving spouse or surviving divorced spouse shall inherit all of the wages and self-employment income credited to such individual during marriage. Terminates such requirement on December 31, 2010. Requires the appropriate congressional committees to study the probable impact on beneficiaries of such termination. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit to certain congressional committees a draft of necessary changes to the law to reflect the substantive changes made by this Act."
