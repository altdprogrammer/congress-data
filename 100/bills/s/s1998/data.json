Authorizes FERC to grant such a petition even if it has previously certificated such transportation. Directs FERC to grant such a petition if it is demonstrated that the local distribution company is willing to transport such gas: (1) without discriminating on the basis of source, ownership, or destination; and (2) at a cost determined by its State commission."
