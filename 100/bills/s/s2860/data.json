    "text": "Bangladesh Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 - Expresses support for assistance programs for the people of Bangladesh in response to the 1988 floods. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to permit funds generated from the sale of U.S. agricultural commodities to be used, with U.S. approval, for disaster relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction assistance in any area of a country participating in the Food for Development Program that is affected by a serious natural disaster. Provides for the retroactive application of this Act. Calls for: (1) a specified amount of the local currencies generated under Food for Development agreements with Bangladesh to be used for assistance for victims of the 1988 floods; and (2) an extension of the period during which such currencies must be used. Requires the President, with the assistance of the Office of Technology Assessment, to report to the Congress on efforts by the international community to develop regional programs for the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins that are designed to ensure a predictable water supply in the dry season and to promote flood control."
