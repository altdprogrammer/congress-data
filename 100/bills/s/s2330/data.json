Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that a minimum of $4,000,000 (currently, a maximum of $10,000,000) in funds made available for foreign assistance programs be used for programs to promote the participation and integration of women in the development process in developing countries. Requires that not less than $2,000,000 of such funds be extended as matching funds to support the efforts of AID field missions to integrate women into their programs. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress annually on the implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations to be made available for the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women."
