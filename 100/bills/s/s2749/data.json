Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years beginning after FY 1988 for National Guard and Reserve military construction and land acquisition projects in specified amounts at specified locations. Limits the obligation of funds for the Army Air Defense system. Revises provisions relating to multiyear procurement authority to allow the President to request from the Congress relief from the requirement of a certain cost savings that must occur before such a contract is authorized to be entered into. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 to require a certain report under such Act to be submitted to the Appropriations Committees of the Congress in addition to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. Authorizes the President to extend the term of office for the officer serving as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until June 1, 1989. Directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct an independent assessment of Army and Air Force studies and analyses of close air support aircraft alternatives for meeting U.S. military requirements for the period between the assessment and the year 2000, and beyond.

Amends the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 to extend until March 15, 1989, the deadline for a report on the implications of a potential Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty for alternative U.S. forces postures in the 1990's. Requires the President to submit an interim report on such subject as of December 15, 1988. Waives certain congressional review periods otherwise applicable in the case of the transfer of two specified obsolete submarines. Title II: Closure and Realignment of Military Installations - Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) close or realign all military installations as recommended by the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure; and (2) initiate and complete all such closures and realignments by specified dates.
