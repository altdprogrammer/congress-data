Permits the FY 1989 expenditure of unobligated independent living program payments made to a State for FY 1987. Authorizes a State to include in its independent living program: (1) foster care children for whom the State is not making foster care maintenance payments; and (2) for six months, children for whom such care or payments were discontinued on or after their 16th birthday. Requires the application of procedural safeguards to any determination regarding the services needed to assist a child in the transition from foster care to independent living. Prohibits the use of Federal funding for independent living initiatives programs on room or board."
