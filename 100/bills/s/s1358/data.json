Makes nonvoidable any termination of a lease or contract pursuant to the terms of the lease or contract and permitted by applicable nonbankruptcy law. Specifies that any interest of a debtor in an asset acquired pursuant to a regularly conducted foreclosure sale or other procedure permitted by law for acquiring a debtor's interest upon default under a security agreement shall be deemed to be taken for new value and not in consideration of an antecedent debt."
