    "text": "Process Patent Act of 1987 - Amends the patent laws to make it an infringement of patent to use, sell, or import into the United States without authority a product produced by a process patented in the United States. Requires the infringer to know or be on notice that the product was made by a process patented in the United States before a process patent holder may recover damages. Authorizes the court to dispose of infringing products as specified. Makes this provision effective prospectively only. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to report annually to the Congress for five years on the effect of this provision on the importation of manufacturing ingredients in certain domestic industries. Places on the defendant the burden of proof in an infringement action to show that a given product was not produced by the patented process."
