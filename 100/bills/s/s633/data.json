Requires the President to ensure the compliance of public vessels with this requirement to the extent practicable. Establishes criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act, based upon several factors, including the circumstances, extent of the violation, and the resulting economic benefit. Makes all Federal agencies responsible for enforcing this Act. Authorizes citizen suits against violators or public officials for failure to act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study methods to reduce or eliminate the disposal of plastics in U.S. waters, requiring a report to the Congress within six months. Directs the Administrator, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a public outreach program to educate the public about the harms caused by the improper disposal of plastics, including penalties under this Act. Title II: Implementation of Annex V - Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to administer and enforce the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (Annex V) which prohibits the disposal of any material from a ship. Title III: Relation to Other Law - States that this Act does not preempt or supersede other Federal or State laws. Title IV: Authorization - Authorizes appropriations."
