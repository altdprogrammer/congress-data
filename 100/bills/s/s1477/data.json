Includes in each such system a Senior Scientific, Technical, and Acquisition Personnel Service (comparable to the Senior Executive Service) for such employees who are specially qualified. Sets forth provisions for scientific, technical, and acquisition employees relating to employment authority and compensation. Sets forth transition provisions for employees designated as subject to an alternative personnel management system. Requires the head of each agency to regularly review the level of professional competence and professional training needs of the scientific and technical work force and the acquisition work force. Directs the Comptroller General to review and evaluate the systems established under this Act and report to the Congress and OPM within five years of its enactment."
