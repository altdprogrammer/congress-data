    "text": "Imported Natural Gas Fair Treatment Act of 1987 - Amends the Natural Gas Act with respect to natural gas imports and exports to provide that the burden of proof in establishing that a proposed importation or exportation authorization is consistent with the public interest lies upon the person seeking such authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prohibits such persons from using discriminatory rates or practices in natural gas transactions. States that the granting of an importation authorization shall not be construed as restricting the review of the prudence of the purchasing practices of any purchaser of such imported natural gas. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to transfer jurisdiction over natural gas importation and exportation from the Economic Regulatory Administration to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission."
