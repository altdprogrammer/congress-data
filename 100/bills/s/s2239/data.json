Specifies that such care shall include: (1) a medical evacuation system; (2) a trauma care hospital center; and (3) a rehabilitation capability. Directs that such care be provided: (1) in accordance with guidelines specified by the American College of Surgeons; (2) on a nondiscriminatory basis; and (3) consistent with the requirements of the 1977 Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Esquipulas II Accord of August 1987, and the March 23, 1988, Nicaraguan ceasefire agreement. Makes assistance under this Act contingent upon the approval of the Government of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan resistance and upon assurance that no reprisals will be taken against wounded persons and that the trauma center established would not be subject to any harassment. Recommends a hospital in La Trinidad, Nicaragua, as the site of the trauma center. Authorizes appropriations."
