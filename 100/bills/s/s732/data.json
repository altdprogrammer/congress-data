Sets forth criteria to govern grant applications and the use of grant funds. Lists the factors the Secretary must consider in determining which hospitals will receive grants. Limits grants to a maximum of $50,000 per year and to a term of no more than two years. Restricts certain capital-related expenditures of grant moneys. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress at least every six months concerning the grant program and to submit a final report at a specified time. Authorizes appropriations from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for FY 1988 through 1989."
