Prohibits the FTC from instituting a civil action, in cases involving consent orders, to obtain civil penalties for unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Permits a district court to review certain FTC determinations of law which found an act or practice unfair or deceptive. Revises the effective dates for cease and desist orders issued by the FTC. Applies FTC civil investigative demand procedures only to acts, practices, or methods of competition declared unlawful by a law. Denies the FTC authority to: (1) study, investigate, or prosecute agricultural cooperatives for any action not in violation of antitrust Acts; or (2) study or investigate agricultural marketing orders. Provides for congressional review and veto of final rules promulgated by the FTC. Makes any such rule effective unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 90 days of the rule's submission. Prohibits the FTC from intervening in the proceedings of any Federal or State agency except where required by Federal law: (1) unless requested by a Member of Congress or a Federal, State, or local official; or (2) without first notifying specified congressional committees. Excludes Federal credit unions from the FTC's unfair acts and practices regulatory authority. Directs the National Credit Union Administration Board to promulgate and enforce regulations concerning unfair acts and practices by credit unions. Authorizes appropriations for the FTC for FY 1988 through 1990. Directs the FTC to conduct a study of advertising which uses the offering of the opportunity to receive something of value as an inducement to purchase that which is being advertised. Requires the FTC to submit the results of such study to specified congressional committees within one year of the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the FTC to submit semiannual reports in FY 1988 through 1990 to specified congressional committees on instances in which: (1) resale price maintenance has been suspected or alleged; and (2) predatory pricing practices have been suspected or alleged. Directs the FTC to study and report to the Congress on: (1) the use of potentially unfair, deceptive, or misleading practices in the marketing, sale, cost, and coverage of health insurance for the elderly; (2) the increase in property and casualty insurance rates to small business owners, local governments, physicians, dentists, and child care centers; and (3) unfair and deceptive practices in the life care home industry. Directs the FTC to monitor complaints concerning the marketing of imported imitation Native American arts, craft, and jewelry in order to determine the extent to which such imports contain the English name of their country of origin. Requires the FTC to distribute a consumer information brochure to assist consumers in filing complaints with the FTC with respect to such imports. Directs the FTC: (1) to study and report to the Congress on deceptive mail practices used in conjunction with the sale of products or services related to governmental functions and the severity of the injury to consumers from such practices; and (2) if necessary, to initiate a trade regulation rule proceeding respecting such practices."
