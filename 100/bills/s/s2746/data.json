    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 4686 passed in lieu) Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to initiate aviation maintenance and safety research on: (1) fire and smoke resistance technologies; (2) specified aspects of aircraft maintenance and structural technologies; (3) the relationship between human factors and aviation accidents; and (4) air traffic control (including dynamic simulation models). Requires the Administrator to submit a national aviation research plan to the Congress. Cites plan contents. Requires the Administrator to report annually to certain congressional committees concerning the previous year's research accomplishments. Establishes within the FAA the Civil Aeromedical Institute to: (1) conduct specified aspects of civil aeromedical research; (2) advise on human factor aspects of proposed air safety rules, aviation personnel training programs, and joint aviation projects; and (3) provide medical consultation services regarding medical certification of airmen. Establishes a research advisory committee within the FAA to advise the Administrator regarding the aviation research program. Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to authorize appropriations for FY 1989 through 1990 for aviation projects. Directs the Administrator to research the effects of automation on the performance of the next generation of air traffic controllers and the air traffic control system, and to report to the Congress regarding such research. Authorizes the Administrator to enter into an agreement with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) regarding the use of NASA facilities to study the human factor aspects of a highly automated environment upon air traffic controllers. Prescribes the contents of such research. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to: (1) issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to determine the feasibility of installing (in all air carrier aircraft) rupture resistant crashworthy fuselage fuel tanks and fuel lines which disconnect and seal in the event of an accident; and (2) undertake research to develop technologies to prevent rapid fuel dispersal and combustibility after an air crash."
