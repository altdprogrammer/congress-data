    "text": "American Partnership for Our Children's Future Act of 1988 - Title I: Income Tax Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an individual taxpayer a refundable income tax credit, in an amount based on adjusted gross income (minimum credit of $150), for each dependent below the age of compulsory school attendance in the State where the taxpayer resides. Sets the maximum credit amount as the total employee tax withheld from the taxpayer's wages during the year under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. Disallows application of the nonrefundable dependent care income tax credit with respect to a taxpayer's dependents under age 15, unless the child is physically or mentally incapable of self-care. Title II: Employer Income Tax Incentives - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income amounts spent by an employer in providing employee child care, comprehensive parental and medical leave programs, or both."
