    "text": "Ground Water Research Act of 1987 - Title I: Programs of the Environmental Protection Agency - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a national research, development, and demonstration program to support the protection, maintenance, and restoration of groundwater resources of the United States. Requires such program to include research, demonstrations, and surveys of causes, prevention, and correction of groundwater contamination. States that priority shall be given to projects which demonstrate the fate of contaminants in groundwater and develop methods and procedures for controlling pollution sources, monitoring water quality, restoring contaminated groundwater, and reducing the contaminating effects of waste materials. Directs the Administrator to investigate the effects on human health and the environment, and on the Nation's water supply needs. Directs the Administrator to establish a media-specific research committee for groundwater resources to report annually for at least five years on the major research issues of groundwater resources, the current status of the research in such issues, and a plan for the succeeding three years. Requires such report to include a list of all major policy decisions affecting groundwater, control technology projects, health effects research, and other research related to groundwater. Makes such report the management plan for the program and requires its review by the Science Advisory Board and submission to the Congress. Directs the Administrator to appoint a Groundwater Research Manager in the Office of Research and Development to carry out such plan. Directs the Administrator to establish a program of research to develop technologies for the control of groundwater pollution. Requires that such program be carried out utilizing demonstration projects through contracts, cooperative agreements, or grants. Requires the Administrator to evaluate projects on the basis of the potential of the proposed method to effectively control sources of contaminants presenting the greatest risk to human health, the environment, or groundwater and such method's potential application in other locations and circumstances as well as the technical and financial capacities of the project's proposer. Requires the Administrator to supervise and monitor such projects. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent of costs. Limits any State's share of available funds to 15 percent. Directs the Administrator to conduct a technology transfer program, including a central reference library. Requires such program to protect trade secrets from public disclosure. Directs the Administrator to list contaminants known to occur in groundwater. Requires an annual review and revision of such list, providing procedures for any person to petition for additions to such list. Requires the Director of the National Toxicology Program to develop and transmit to the Administrator a proposed research program for each listed contaminant which includes studies of chemical and physical properties, health and ecological effects, and its dispersion and persistence when released. Requires importers or manufacturers of listed contaminants to register with and report annually to the Administrator concerning amounts and other information. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations. Authorizes reimbursement from such manufacturers and importers for costs of such contaminants research program. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct further research if necessary. Directs the Administrator to publish criteria for each listed contaminant upon completion of its research program, based on the properties and effects of such contaminant and its association with activities which have potential to be sources of the contaminant in groundwater, including a risk assessment posed by the contaminant at various concentrations in and with respect to various uses of water. Establishes criminal penalties for the release of protected information such as trade secrets. Requires the Administrator to make grants to universities or research institutions to establish and operate four groundwater research institutes to conduct research and training and disseminate information on the protection and restoration of groundwater. Bases selection on whether such institute would be located in a region making significant use of groundwater with significant contamination problems and the capacity of such institute to carry on and lead such research. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent of costs. Designates the National Center for Ground Water Research as one of the institutes. Requires another to serve an area of primarily karstic topography and a third to serve an area of primarily intermountain glaciated geology. Earmarks funds for technology transfer. Requires the Administrator to approve and evaluate each institute's research. Directs the Administrator to conduct a series of nationwide groundwater quality assessments to identify the frequency and concentration of contaminants in groundwater associated with various categories and subcategories of sources or potential sources of contaminants. Includes monitoring at public and private wells. Establishes an assessment schedule for: (1) pesticide applications; (2) septic tanks and cesspools; (3) landfills, surface impoundments, and wastepiles; (4) Class V injection wells; (5) fertilizer applications; (6) irrigation return flows; and (7) publicly owned treatment works. Requires as preliminary phases to such assessments: (1) a survey to determine the types and distribution of sources for each category; (2) the development and preparation of techniques and protocols to be used; and (3) the preparation of health advisories for each contaminant. Requires groundwater quality assessments to determine the impact of contaminant sources on the quality of drinking water specifically and generally, and determine the vulnerability of sources of groundwater and the effectiveness of various control strategies. Requires the Administrator to notify the water system or well owner when a contaminant is found, but requires that information affecting a well owner be kept confidential. Directs the Administrator to notify the appropriate government authorities for response when a source for a contaminant is identified. Requires the Administrator to cooperate with the States and utilize the Science Advisory Board in planning and conducting assessments. Requires the Administrator to provide the Congress with a plan for implementing these requirements and a status report on each assessment which shall also be submitted to the President, the States, and the public. Requires peer review of all studies conducted under this Act. Authorizes the provision of facilities and equipment for demonstration projects under this Act, limiting construction of facilities on non-Federal land. Title II: Programs of the Geological Survey - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Geological Survey, to undertake research, investigations, appraisals, surveys, and related activities of the Nation's water resources. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with other government agencies and to perform such activities on a reimburseable basis, as specified. Includes regional aquifer systems analysis and a toxics hydrology program in such activities. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees and the States on the condition of the Nation's groundwater and groundwater information and monitoring programs. Directs the Secretary to establish a national groundwater quality and quantity assessment. Requires such program to coordinate government efforts in such area, seek to achieve uniform data collection, and provide information and assistance as required. Amends the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to make conforming changes. Title III: Programs of Other Federal Agencies - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Agricultural Research Service, to establish a national research, development, and demonstration program with respect to the impact of agricultural practices on groundwater quality, including the application of pesticides and nutrients, irrigation practices, and the operation of animal feedlots. Requires the Secretary to address: (1) chemical and biological interactions and processes, including the fate and transport of substances released by agricultural practices; (2) analytical models and testing methodology; and (3) management and control. Title IV: General Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct research and investigations and report to the Congress within-two years on practices for improving the efficiency of fertilizer uses in agriculture, including timing and rate of applications. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989. Requires the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the chemical constituents of commercial fertilizer products sold in the United States. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to study and report on the public health effects of nitrates, nitrosamines, and other metabolites of nutrients and nitrogen in drinking water supplies, including sources, levels of exposures, and methods and costs of control. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to conduct research and report to the Congress on developing a cost effective leak detection system for undergound storage tanks containing petroleum. Requires the use of best available technology. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the Geological Survey to study and report to State and local governments on the existing and projected use of geothermal wells on groundwater. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to conduct research and report to the Congress on the use of microbial activity to neutralize and contain hazardous or mining wastes. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on the impact of agricultural drainage wells on groundwater, including alternatives for drainage. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to the Agricultural Research Board to study and report to the Congress on the impact of conservation tillage and other soil and water conservation practices on groundwater quality. Directs the Administrator to establish a national groundwater clearinghouse. Requires the President to coordinate and report to the Congress on the coordination of groundwater research activities, including agency-by-agency review. Vests in the United States any patent rights resulting from inventions created in the course of or under contract of the Administrator under this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to waive such rights in the best interests of the public and the United States, based on the need to encourage participation and other factors. Authorizes a reserve of limited rights, such as a nonexclusive license, to a contractor or inventor. Permits the Administrator to grant exclusive licenses if to do so would bring an invention to the point of commercial or practical application, so long as competition is not substantially lessened.
