Authorizes appropriations for the employment of up to 30 persons who shall report to the Under Secretary. Requires the head of each agency to include with each appropriation request a statement as to whether and to what extent the amounts representing actual transactions and balances for the most recently completed fiscal year were derived from accounting systems which conform to the requirements prescribed by the Comptroller General and implemented by the Under Secretary. Requires such statements to be included in the President's annual budget for each pertinent budget section. Requires the designation of an agency chief financial officer in the: (1) Department of Agriculture; (2) Department of Commerce; (3) Department of Defense; (4) Department of Education; (5) Department of Energy; (6) Department of Health and Human Services; (7) Department of Housing and Urban Development; (8) Department of the Interior; (9) Department of Justice; (10) Department of Labor; (11) Department of State; (12) Department of Transportation; (13) Department of the Treasury; (14) Department of the Army; (15) Department of the Navy; (16) Department of the Air Force; (17) Defense Logistics Agency; (18) Environmental Protection Agency; (19) General Services Administration; (20) National Aeronautics and Space Administration; (21) Small Business Administration; and (22) Veterans Administration.
