Limits the aggregate quantity of lamb which may be entered (imported) in any calendar year under such Act. Allows such amount to be increased or decreased in relation to an increase or decrease in the domestic production of lamb. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, within 30 days after the enactment of this Act, to prescribe necessary regulations to convert live lamb into a poundage suitable for purposes of applying the import limitations required under this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct a study to determine whether a disproportionate quantity of lamb meat is entered quarterly into the United States. Directs the Secretary, by the later of June 1, 1988, or 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, to report the results of such study to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee."
