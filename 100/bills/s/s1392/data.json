Specifies such sanctions as: (1) making South Korea ineligible as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the generalized system of preferences; (2) prohibiting the Overseas Private Investment Corporation from providing any insurance, reinsurance, guarantees, or financing for projects in South Korea; and (3) requiring the U.S. Executive Director of each relevant multilateral development bank to cast a negative vote on any loan or other financial or technical assistance for South Korea which is not directed to programs which serve basic human needs."
