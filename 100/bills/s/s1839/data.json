Sets forth standards for such a center. Sets forth matters which, as a condition of payment, must be certified by an existing State program which determines eligibility under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act or by a State-administered preadmission screening program meeting certain minimum requirements. Makes deductibles inapplicable to adult day health care, requiring only the payment of a specified coinsurance amount. Provides for the evaluation of plans of correction submitted by centers found not to meet the conditions of participation and for sanctions against such centers, in lieu of cancellation of certification, including civil fines and suspensions of payments. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations regarding adult day health care programs. Requires the Secretary to adopt the standards established by the National Institute of Adult Day Care as the minimum standards for qualifying as a provider of such care."
