Prohibits stockpiling of cigarettes between the issuing and effective dates of the standard. Provides for judicial review of the rule. Prohibits the manufacturing or importing of a cigarette unless the cigarette is in compliance with a standard issued under provisions of this Act. Declares violation of the prohibition to be a violation of provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. States that this Act does not preempt any law of a State which prescribes a more stringent fire safety standard for cigarettes. Prohibits, in any civil action for damages, admitting compliance with the standard as a defense."
