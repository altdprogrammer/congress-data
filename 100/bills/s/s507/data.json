Directs the Secretary to assure that such grants are distributed among the States on the basis of population and geographic characteristics. Directs the Secretary to take into consideration the degree to which the State application was developed through consultation with teachers, administrators, teacher union representatives (where applicable), local educational agency personnel, faculty from institutions of higher education, and the educational regional resource center (where appropriate) serving the State. Sets forth requirements for State plans and for local applications. Sets forth the Federal and nonfederal share of the costs of such programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993."
