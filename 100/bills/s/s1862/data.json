Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Provides formulae for the allotment of appropriated funds to the States. Establishes a minimum allotment of $50,000 for each State. Authorizes, in the event a State does not submit an allotment application or notifies the Secretary of Health and Human Services that it does not intend to use the full amount of the allotment, an organ transplant center in the State to apply for the amount of the allotment not allocated to the State. Enumerates the purposes for which the States may use such allotments. Details the application procedures and grant requirements. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the impact of this Act. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to authorize States to provide immunosuppressive drugs to individuals who have received organ transplants."
