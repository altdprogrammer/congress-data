Repeals the authority of the Commission to revoke a station license or construction permit for willful or repeated failure of a station to grant or sell broadcast time to a candidate for Federal office. Repeals the requirement that a licensee grant equal opportunities to all political candidates who use the licensee's broadcasting station."
