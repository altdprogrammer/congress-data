Title II: Tort Claims - Excludes from immunity from suit (thereby allowing tort claims to be brought against) a negligent or wrongful act or omission of a person while exercising duties in or for the Veterans Administration's Department of Medicine and Surgery. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to settle any claims arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act to the extent delegated by the Attorney General, within specified limitations."
