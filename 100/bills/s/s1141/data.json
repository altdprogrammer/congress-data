Specifies that storage must take place: (1) on the grounds of the commercial nuclear powerplant which generated the spent fuel; (2) on the grounds of a commercial nuclear powerplant to which spent fuel has been transshipped; or (3) at a monitored retrievable storage facility licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
