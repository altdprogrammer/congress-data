Amends the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to authorize the Secretary of State to purchase, maintain, and operate facilities for radio transmission of information about U.S. policies, including the leasing of associated real property (either within or outside the United States) for periods not to exceed 40 years (currently not to exceed 25 years). Authorizes the Secretary, or any Government agency, in carrying out the provisions of the Act to lease, maintain, and operate aircraft. Authorizes payments received by or for the use of the Agency in connection with English-teaching, motion picture, and television programs conducted by the Agency to be credited to the Agency's applicable appropriation. Amends the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 to authorize the Director of the United States Information Agency to facilitate the placement in the United States and other countries of educational and cultural television programs and motion pictures produced by the Agency and foreign governmental institutions, individuals, or public or private organizations. Authorizes the Director to enter into an agreement with Pakistan for the establishment of a fund for which the United States will provide a one time grant for English language training or other cultural, educational, and scientific programs of mutual interest. Requires U.S. representatives on any board created to administer such fund to be designated by the Director predominantly from U.S. agencies. Authorizes the Director to make available to the fund up to $598,176 in foreign currencies owned by the United States in Pakistan or owed to the United States by Pakistan."
