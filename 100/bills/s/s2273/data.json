Provides that such funds and other FY 1988 funds appropriated pursuant to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program, which have been retained by the Secretary of HHS and allocated, but not distributed, for the benefit of the Crow Tribe, shall remain available for that purpose until expended. Directs the Secretary of HHS and the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an interagency agreement for the administration on an expedited basis of such transferred funds. Requires that such agreement include assurances that the Secretary of the Interior will follow certain requirements of such Act regarding the provision of technical assistance. Requires such funds to be used to provide, through the Crow agency social service program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the assistance and benefits available under such Act to those Indian households that meet the eligibility criteria established by the State of Montana and the Crow Tribe for such year. Provides for equitable consideration of claims or applications involving all forms of energy. Requires that, if direct vendor payments are made, the vendor shall agree to refrain from termination of service to an eligible household until administrative actions involving the withholding of FY 1988 grants under such Act from the Crow Tribe have been resolved."
