Makes all laws and regulations generally applicable to Indians applicable to the Tribe and its members, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this Act. Restores all rights and privileges of the Tribe and its members under any Federal treaty, agreement, or other authority which were diminished or lost under a specified 1954 statute. Makes the Tribe and its members eligible for all Federal services and benefits furnished to federally recognized tribes or their members without regard to the existence of a reservation for the Tribe. Deems members of the Tribe in specified counties in the State of Oregon to be residing on a reservation for purposes of the availability of such services, notwithstanding the future establishment of a reservation for the Tribe. Declares that the Tribe shall be considered an Indian tribe for the purposes of the Indian Tribal Government Tax Status Act. Provides that the Indian Reorganization Act shall apply to the Tribe and its members. Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into negotiations with the Tribal Council of the Coquille Tribe with respect to establishing a plan for economic development for the Tribe; and (2) upon approval by the Tribal Council, submit such plan to the Congress. Requires that such plan provide that any real property: (1) transferred by the Tribe or its members to the Secretary be held in the name of the United States for the benefit of the Tribe; (2) taken in trust by the Secretary pursuant to such plan be subject to all legal rights and interests in such land existing at the time of the acquisition of such land by the Secretary and subject to foreclosure or sale under State law; and (3) transferred pursuant to such plan be exempt from Federal, State, and local taxation. Provides for the transfer of land to be held in trust for the Tribe as part of its reservation. Requires the State of Oregon to exercise criminal and civil jurisdiction within the boundaries of the reservation. Declares open the membership roll of August 29, 1960, compiled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Requires the Interim Council to establish and publish an application and enrollment process. Specifies the criteria for enrollments. Establishes procedures for verification of eligibility for enrollment and for appeals of adverse determinations.
