Establishes in the Treasury the National Organ Transplant Trust Fund and appropriates to it amounts equal to those designated on tax returns, as well as any other cash contributions made to it. Directs each State to establish a program through which Fund monies will be used to provide assistance in paying the costs of organ transplantation procedures and immunosuppressive drugs for individuals who meet certain financial need requirements and who have a medical condition for which a transplant procedure is reasonably medically necessary. Prescribes conditions to govern Fund administration. Permits payment of Fund monies to a State only if the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that the State is properly carrying out its program and has fully accounted for previously received monies. Requires the State's chief health officer to place monies received from the Fund into a separate interest-bearing account, to be disbursed only to eligible individuals. Limits the ways in which States may use Fund monies. Requires each State to submit an annual report concerning its organ transplant program."
