Declares that the authorized amounts and personnel ceilings for such intelligence activities are those specified in the classified schedule of authorizations prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate as amended by the Senate Committee on Armed Services. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires the Director to notify the House and Senate Intelligence Committees whenever he exceeds the authorized ceiling. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1988 and 1989. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 237 full-time Intelligence Community Staff Employees. Provides that such staff shall be administered in the same manner as the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1988 and 1989. Title IV: Enhanced Counterintelligence and Security Capabilities - Requires the Attorney General to submit annual reports to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on the admission to the United States, over the objections of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, of certain Soviet diplomatic personnel. Authorizes the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to provide additional compensation to the New York Field Division to defray unusual living expenses associated with such employment. Title V: DOD Intelligence Personnel Improvements - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay a uniform allowance to civilian employees of the Defense Attache Offices located outside the United States. Extends through FY 1989 the Secretary's special authority to terminate the employment of Defense Intelligence Agency employees and Department of Defense military intelligence personnel. Exempts the Defense Intelligence Agency from any requirement to disclose information on its organization, functions, or personnel. States that such exemption shall not apply to any responsibility of the DIA to report to the Congress. Amends the National Security Agency Act of 1959 to allow the Secretary of Defense to offer advanced training in certain skills critical to the mission of the National Security Agency. Title VI: General Provisions - Provides that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States."
