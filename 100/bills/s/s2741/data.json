    "date": "1988-08-11", 
    "text": "Partnerships in Child Care Act of 1988 - Amends title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act to establish a Child Care Grant Program (Program) under which States receive allotments, varying in size among States on the basis of the number of children under age 15 residing with families in each of the States, covering 75 percent of the costs of creating new child care programs and expanding and improving existing child care services. Authorizes the use of such funds in promoting public partnerships with private child care entities. Authorizes appropriations for the Program for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires States to designate a State agency which will administer the funds provided pursuant to this Act and coordinate programs and services that are assisted with such funding with the child care services of other State and local agencies. Sets forth State grant application requirements, including that States: (1) describe the activities that will be implemented with such grants; (2) use no more than ten percent of their allocations for administrative expenses; (3) ensure that all eligible child care providers are registered or licensed in conformance with State and local regulatory standards; (4) report annually to the Secretary on the services and programs created or assisted with such grants; and (5) give priority to child care programs that serve low-income areas. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the child and dependent care tax credit from 30 to 40 percent reduced by two percent (but not below 20 percent) for each $2,000 by which the taxpayer's income exceeds $12,000. Makes 75 percent of such credit refundable in advance for taxpayers whose income does not exceed $32,000. Prohibits credits for child care services which are provided outside the taxpayer's household and do not comply with all applicable State or local laws and regulations. Establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services a Coordinator of Child Care who is to be appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the Secretary. Requires the Coordinator to coordinate the Department's child care activities, collect and publish State child care standards, and implement a national child care data collection system. Authorizes appropriations for such activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Commission on Child Care to conduct a national assessment of the quality of day care provided in a range of settings and submit a report to the Congress, within three years of this Act's enactment, that includes: (1) model child care standards; (2) a strategy for the recruitment, retention, and training of qualified child care personnel; and (3) recommendations for expanding child care availability through the private sector. Requires the Secretary to enter into agreements with five to ten States to establish models for a continuum of child care services for children of ages of infancy through adolescence, giving priority to States that propose to utilize and coordinate existing State resources and facilities through public partnerships with the private sector. Authorizes appropriations for such programs for FY 1990 and 1991. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding such programs by the close of 1993. Directs the Coordinator of Child Care to submit a report to the Congress, within 18 months of this Act's enactment, that contains the results of a study conducted by the Secretary of the availability, accessibility, and quality of day care services and an inventory of State child care standards. Requires the Secretary to review and report to the Congress and the President regarding Federal policies regarding leave, alternative work schedules, and other programs and policies that assist working parents. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) Federal, State, and local governments should serve as models for private businesses in providing child care benefits for employees; and (2) State and local governments should review their programs and policies that assist working parents."
