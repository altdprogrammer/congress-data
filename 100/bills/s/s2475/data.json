    "text": "Farmers' Market Nutrition Enhancement Act - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to authorize three-year demonstration project grants in seven States to provide coupons (between ten and 20 dollars' worth) to special supplemental food program (WIC) recipients for use at farmers' markets. Requires at least 30 percent State matching funds. Sets minimum and maximum grant amounts at $75,000 and $700,000, respectively. Prohibits the use of funds to construct or operate a farmers' market. Limits the use of funds for administrative costs. Requires: (1) State recipients to make annual reports to the Secretary of Agriculture; and (2) the Secretary to provide the Congress with a project evaluation report within two years after the last grant award. Authorizes FY 1989 through 1991 appropriations."
