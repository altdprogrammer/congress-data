    "text": "Hazardous Waste Reduction Act - Requires filings of the annual toxic chemical release forms required under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 to include a toxic chemical waste reduction and recycling report for each listed toxic chemical for the preceding calendar year. Requires such report to include information on a facility-by-facility basis as to the amounts and disposition of each toxic chemical, including levels of waste reduction and recycling achieved and expected. Requires that toxic chemical waste reduction practices be delineated according to set categories, such as equipment, redesign, and substitution of raw materials. Requires the inclusion of a production index for each toxic chemical waste and a list of techniques used to identify waste reduction opportunities. Provides protection for trade secrets. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a central receiving facility at EPA for the storage and retrieval of waste management program information. Requires the Administrator to collect, coordinate, and consolidate data collection requirements under environmental statutes. Requires all such information to be compiled into a data base organized on an industry-by-industry basis according to Standard Industrial Classifications and on a waste stream basis. Directs the Administrator to establish a Waste Reduction and Recycling Clearinghouse Program to include information on approaches to waste reduction and recycling and information from States receiving grants for technical assistance programs. Requires the Clearinghouse to be actively involved in technology transfer and the development of waste reduction technologies. Requires the Administrator to make matching grants to States for innovative waste reduction programs. Requires such programs to make specific and targeted technical assistance available to businesses as well as for funding experts and research and providing training. Directs the Administrator to report annually to the Congress on the waste reduction information gathered pursuant to this Act. Requires such report to include a profile of waste reduction levels on an industry-by-industry basis and identify priorities as to industries, pollutants, and research. Establishes the Office of Waste Reduction within EPA to collect waste reduction plans and information from other EPA offices on an industry-by-industry basis, administer the clearinghouse and State grants programs, and carry out other related responsibilities including improving EPA's ability to evaluate multimedia waste management practices and the potential for waste reduction through information collection and retrieval. Authorizes appropriations."
