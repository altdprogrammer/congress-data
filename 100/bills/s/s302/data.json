Exempts from such tax crude oil or refined petroleum products purchased for export. Specifies that such fee shall be imposed only at a time when the average international price of crude oil for any four-week period is less than $18 per barrel. Sets the rate of such tax as the difference between $18 per barrel and the average international price of crude oil for the preceding four-week period."
