    "text": "International Volunteer Military Training Act - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to authorize the President to enter into agreements with foreign governments purchasing defense articles under such Act by which the United States will make available certain Federal retirees to provide training and advice to such countries regarding the maintenance, management, or technology skills needed by the countries as a result of the acquisition of such articles. Requires such programs to be implemented through existing procedures, including the use of Department of Defense and host country personnel in identifying and implementing such programs. Requires each host country to pay the United States for the travel expenses, health insurance, and a per diem for each Government retiree utilized in such a program, together with a fee to cover the administrative expenses incurred with respect to such retiree by the sponsoring private and voluntary organization. Allows certain credits allotted under such Act or certain funds made available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to such countries to be utilized in lieu of such payment. Requires the Federal Government to reimburse each retiree the amounts paid or credited with respect to each such individual. Authorizes the President to reimburse private and voluntary organizations for the expenses incurred in establishing and administering the retiree programs. Authorizes appropriations."
