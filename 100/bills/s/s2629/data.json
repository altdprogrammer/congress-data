Authorizes the Secretary to postpone any withholding or reprogramming of Federal-aid highway funds with respect to a non-compliant State if the Secretary determines that such action would result in hardship to the State. Requires the Secretary to restore promptly the unobligated balance of any withheld funds when the Secretary determines that a State has come into compliance for the fiscal year for which the funds were withheld or reprogrammed. Precludes the Secretary from reducing apportionments for noncompliance during FY 1987 and 1988 until final enforcement regulations have been promulgated. Repeals the 55 mile-per-hour national speed limit."
