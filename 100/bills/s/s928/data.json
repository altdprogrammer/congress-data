Requires the Government to consider antidumping and countervailing duties when awarding procurement contracts. Establishes procedures to prevent the release of confidential information presented to, or obtained by, the U.S. International Trade Commission or other administering authority during an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding. Requires any party submitting information to the administering authority during such a proceeding to serve the information upon all other parties to the proceeding. Requires any person submitting information to the Department of Commerce or the International Trade Commission in an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding to certify that it is accurate and complete. Establishes a private cause of action for customs fraud. Permits recovery of actual damages for injuries sustained, equitable relief, and reasonable attorney's fees. Allows the United States to intervene in such an action as a matter of right."
