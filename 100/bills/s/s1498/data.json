Earmarks specified amounts of appropriated funds for: (1) expenses of arms control negotiations conducted with the Soviet Union on strategic arms reductions, intermediate-range nuclear forces, and space and defensive weapons; (3) the Reduced Enrichment in Research and Test Reactors program; (4) the program for visiting scholars in the field of arms control and disarmament. Requires the President to submit to the Congress an annual report by the U.S. Commissioner on the activities of the United States-Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Standing Consultative Commission established under the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems. Revises the requirements for the annual report concerning arms-control compliance to require the inclusion of information on actions taken by the Soviet Union with regard to the size, structure, and disposition of its military forces in order to comply with existing arms control agreements. Requires the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to submit an annual report to the Congress setting forth a comprehensive list of research, development, and other studies relating to arms control and disarmament issues concluded during the previous calendar year by Government agencies or for Government agencies by private or public institutions or persons."
