Provides that the Federal share of a State's construction costs on the Interstate System shall include the interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State to the extent that the bond proceeds have been expended in the construction of such projects on the System. Prohibits the Secretary from approving applications for the Federal share of construction costs if the amount of approved applications in the category of funds involved exceeds certain apportionments for the applicant State."
