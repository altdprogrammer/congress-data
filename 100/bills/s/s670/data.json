Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase the maximum individual income tax rate to 35 percent; (2) eliminate the phase-out of personal exemptions; and (3) include net capital gain in the calculation of phase-out of the 15-percent rate (thus setting a 28 percent maximum individual long-term capital gains rate)."
