Specifies limited activities that may be subject to an exempt agreement, understanding, or concert of action between or among insurers, members of an advisory organization, or other persons. Permits insurers in joint underwriting, pools, or residual market mechanisms to cooperate with each other in the following activities if the residual market mechanism is required by law or approved by a government agency, or if the joint underwriting pools do not unreasonably restrain trade: (1) making rates, rating systems, policy forms, underwriting rules, surveys, inspections, and investigations; (2) furnishing loss statistics; and (3) carrying on research on causes or the prevention of losses. Permits any State to: (1) establish or approve a residual market mechanism; and (2) require a workers' compensation and employers' liability insurer to adhere to the uniform classification system and uniform rating plan applicable to such types of insurance in such State, provided that no such insurer shall agree with any other insurer or with an advisory organization to use any rate."
