Transfers direct administrative authority and responsibility over the Foreign Building Office of the Department of State from the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration to the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security. Requires the Secretary of State to submit an annual report to the Congress concerning security-related factors and the contracting and construction plans for each Government construction project planned or underway in a foreign country. Establishes an interagency board to review and approve all such reports. Specifies that the board shall consist of representatives of the Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and National Security Agency and shall be headed by the Under Secretary of State for Management. Requires the Secretary to consider utilizing the Army Corps of Engineers, in lieu of other Government or private contractors, to manage the construction of any Government project in any Communist-controlled country."
