Amends Federal law relating to procurement and supply within the VA to direct the VA to procure medical and pharmaceutical supplies only under national contracts awarded by the VA. Permits local contracts to be used for such procurement only in certain emergency situations and only for a specified maximum percentage of all such procurement. Requires the medical center director of each VA medical center, at the beginning of each fiscal year, to submit to the Administrator a list of all medical and pharmaceutical supplies procured by that medical center under a local contract during the preceding fiscal year."
