Requires that, in determining which rural health care providers will participate in such projects, the Secretary: (1) take into account the extent to which the proposed project will test the use of volunteers and paraprofessionals in the delivery of such care; and (2) ensure that approximately 75 percent of the projects are community-based while approximately 25 percent are hospital-based. Requires the Secretary to conduct an on-going evaluation of each project which includes an analysis of the quality of care provided, community and recipient acceptance of the project, and the financial impact of the project on the programs under titles XVIII (Medicare), XIX (Medicaid), and XX (Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act. Provides that such projects may include case management services and home health, day, and respite care, but prohibits the inclusion of services for which payment is otherwise made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the results of such projects by January 1, 1994. Authorizes appropriations for such projects from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund through FY 1993."
