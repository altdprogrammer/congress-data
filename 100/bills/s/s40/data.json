Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a utilization facility operating license unless the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has issued a finding regarding whether such facility has in place an offsite emergency plan which will provide assurance that the public health and safety will be protected. Revokes upon enactment of this Act any license issued by the Commission that is not based upon such a finding by FEMA."
