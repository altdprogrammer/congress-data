Provides that, on or before August 1, 1988, and each fifth year thereafter, the President shall transmit to the Congress a plan for the National STORM Program and its budgetary requirements, specifying the activities to be conducted and the Federal agency which will conduct them. Directs the President, on or about January 1, 1989, to transmit to the Congress a progress report on implementing the National STORM Program. Directs the Administration to: (1) place a high priority on reinstating the two geostationary operational environmental satellite (GOES) system; (2) compensate for the absence of a second GOES satellite by taking actions such as increasing hurricane reconnaissance flights; and (3) undertake an immediate analysis of how best to maintain a two GOES system."
