Urges the Government of Thailand to reinstitute its former policy of first asylum and officially end its policy of interdiction of arriving refugee boats. Urges the United States and other western nations to maintain their policies of resettlement. Urges the Government of Hong Kong and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to maintain their policies of first asylum. Urges the Department of State to continue working with ASEAN and other governments to meet security concerns while responding to the humanitarian needs of Southeast Asian refugees. Urges the President and the Department of State to admit the full number of Southeast Asian refugees that is fixed each year. Urges the Government of Vietnam to: (1) issue exit permits to Vietnamese who have letters of introduction from the United States or are former reeducation camp members and expand the Orderly Departure Program to stem the movement of refugees out of Vietnam; and (2) cease its occupation of Cambodia. Urges the governments of Indochinese countries to cease their policies of repression. Urges the United States to participate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and ASEAN in preparing an international conference on Indochinese refugees which seeks to adopt a program to deal with the Vietnamese boat people."
