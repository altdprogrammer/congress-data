    "text": "Expresses the concern of the congress over the October 1987 arrests of 43 Sarawak tribal people. Encourages the Malaysian Government and the State of Sarawak to: (1) consult with the indigenous groups of the forest of Sarawak who are concerned with the future of the forest; (2) release all those imprisoned for the expression of their views and lift all restrictions on the rights of those detained for their opposition to the environmental and public policies of the Government of Malaysia; and (3) cease attacks on the independence of the Malaysian judiciary. Calls upon the President to: (1) encourage the importation into the United States of only hardwood harvested in a sustainable manner, and urge other countries to adopt similar practices; (2) encourage Malaysia and all countries marketing tropical hardwood to promote sustainable forestry practices; and (3) urge the Malaysian Government and the Government of the State of Sarawak to release those imprisoned for the expression of their views, lift restrictions on the rights of those detained for opposition to governmental public policies, and cease attacks on the Malaysian judiciary. Urges the President to communicate to the International Tropical Timber Organization that the United States: (1) advocates that the interests of indigenous peoples play a key role within the Organization; (2) encourages the Organization to develop environmentally sound policies; and (3) condemns imports of tropical hardwood from logging concession areas where activities cause environmental damage, are not managed for sustained use, or endanger the way of life of the inhabitants of the forest."
