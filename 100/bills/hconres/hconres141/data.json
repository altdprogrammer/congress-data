States that the Congress: (1) regrets the decision by President Chun to suspend discussions on constitutional reform and hold elections under the existing electoral system; (2) calls upon both the Government and the opposition to enter into a good-faith dialogue on the political future of South Korea; (3) believes that one of the objectives of such dialogue should be electorial reform; and (4) calls upon all elements in South Korea to renounce the use of violence for political purposes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Government of South Korea should take specified steps toward democratization while simultaneously moving to establish a climate of trust which would facilitate the establishment of a meaningful dialogue with the opposition. States that the Congress welcomes the proposals made by Democratic Justice Party Chairman Roh Tae Woo for political reforms in Korea."
