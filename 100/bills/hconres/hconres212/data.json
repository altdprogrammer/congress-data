Calls upon the President to immediately suspend all military and non-emergency economic assistance to Haiti (except for assistance specifically related to the electoral process) until the President reports to the Congress that the NGC is providing such protection and support. Urges the President to express support for free and fair elections and concern over deteriorating security conditions in Haiti."
