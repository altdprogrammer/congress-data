States that the basis for such reserve should be: (1) all signatory nations shall agree to bring virgin land into crop production and return a certain percentage of cropland to its natural state; (2) an emergency provision to allow a portion of the cropland of all signatory nations to be put back in production if emergency food reserves are depleted or if production did not meet domestic consumption; and (3) a coordinated international food aid program."
