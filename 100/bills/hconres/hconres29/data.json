Declares that such violations, especially Soviet refusal to permit emigration, affect U.S.-Soviet relations. Calls upon the Soviet authorities to release specified individuals who wish to emigrate. Declares that the Congress dedicates itself to support, as a priority in the 100th Congress, the restoration of human rights to all Soviet citizens, especially the right of all Soviet Jews and others who have requested exit permits to emigrate."
