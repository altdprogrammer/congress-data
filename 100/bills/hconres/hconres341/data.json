Urges the Agency for International Development to: (1) redirect resources to providing low-cost vehicles; and (2) report to the Congress on the effectiveness of multilateral development banks regarding lending for mobility needs of the poor in developing nations. Urges U.S. officials to increase the emphasis multilateral development banks place on nonmotorized, low-cost alternatives to private motor vehicles. Urges the Peace Corps to encourage the use of nonmotorized transport technologies in its projects and by its volunteers."
