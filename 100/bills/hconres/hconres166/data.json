States that the Congress should not appropriate additional funds to such resistance forces unless the President: (1) finds and reports to the Congress (and the Congress accepts such findings) that the United States supports the efforts of President Arias and the assistance to such forces in formally supported by the Organization of American States or the nations adjacent to Nicaragua, is in the national security interests of the United States, and will not interfere with Nicaragua's acceptance of a cease-fire and peace plan; or (2) certifies to the Congress that Nicaragua has not signed a peace plan which has been accepted by neighboring nations and which is supported by the United States."
