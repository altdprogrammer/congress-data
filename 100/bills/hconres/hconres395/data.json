Concludes that: (1) the data in the 1982 Department of Energy radiation study is inadequate and that the conclusions as to habitability are not supported by such data; (2) the comprehensive, independent study of Rongelap pursuant to the Veterans' Compensation Rate Increase and Job Training Amendments of 1985 should be immediately undertaken, should examine all the Rongelap Atoll islands, and should specifically examine radiation and related problems with respect to the children on Rongelap, past cumulative doses of plutonium, and chromosome damage to the entire Rongelap population; and (3) the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Energy should make available to the Government of the Marshall Islands such sums as may be necessary to contract for such study."
