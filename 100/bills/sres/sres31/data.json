Urges the Secretary of State to take specified actions to encourage Soviet military withdrawal and a peaceful settlement of the situation in Afghanistan. Urges the: (1) Soviet Union to present a timetable of no more than four months for the withdrawal of its forces at the next session of U.N.-sponsored indirect negotiations in February 1987; and (2) Government of Pakistan to resist Soviet pressure to accept less than such a timetable for withdrawal of such forces."
