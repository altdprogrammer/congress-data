    "text": "Condemns: (1) violations by the Japanese squid gillnet fleet of fishing boundaries in the Northern Pacific Ocean; and (2) the Japanese Government's failure to provide for adequate enforcement of regulations covering the activities of such fleet. Requests the President to direct the appropriate executive agencies to achieve: (1) a negotiated settlement providing for changes to the Japanese laws and regulations governing such fleet and more active enforcement by Japanese authorities; and (2) more effective monitoring and enforcement by U.S. agencies. Urges the Secretary of State to direct the efforts of the State Department toward achieving an agreement with Japan providing for specified enforcement measures, including; (1) a guaranteed level of at-sea boardings and inspections by Japanese enforcement vessels; (2) a fisheries observer program involving U.S. observers; and (3) the right of U.S. authorities to board and inspect Japanese fishing vessels. Urges the Secretary of Transportation to direct the efforts of the Coast Guard toward increasing surveillance and enforcement efforts in connection with the squid fishery. Urges the Secretary of Commerce to invoke provisions imposing sanctions in the form of higher fees for Japanese gillnet fishing permits, for FY 1987, or provide to the Congress a full and adequate justification for failure to do so in light of Japan's failure to adequately regulate its squid fishing vessels in accordance with U.S. Japanese, and international law."
