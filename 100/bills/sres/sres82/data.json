    "text": "Declares that the Senate urges the Government of South Africa to: (1) release all political prisoners and begin negotiations within a specified time with black leaders of South Africa to end apartheid; (2) propose a specific plan to institute reforms in place of apartheid; and (3) abolish apartheid and install a new democratic government that guarantees equal rights to all citizens. Urges the U.S. Government, if the above-mentioned actions are not implemented, to discontinue the use of U.S. veto power to block proposed sanctions against South Africa in the United Nations, cut all telecommunications between the United States and South Africa, and continue such actions until the abolition of apartheid. Urges the U.S. Government to support white minority rights and to discourage divestment of American business in South Africa if South Africa ends the apartheid system."
