Directs that such support include the temporary storage and organization of, system of access to, and security of documents related to the negotiating records of such treaties. Directs the Majority and Minority Leaders to make arrangements with the executive branch to provide for the transmission, organization, and system of access to the negotiating record relating to such treaties submitted for advice and consent.
