Declares that the report and recommendations of the advisory board established under Public Law 100-2 to provide for a temporary prohibition of strikes or lockouts with respect to the Long Island Rail Road labor-management dispute shall be binding on the parties, except that nothing in this joint resolution prevents a mutual written agreement by the parties different from those established by this joint resolution. Prohibits the parties to the dispute from taking action with respect to the issue of repair and maintenance of a certain motor vehicle fleet until the next conference between such parties under the Railway Labor Act. Directs the parties to consider such issue in the conference."
