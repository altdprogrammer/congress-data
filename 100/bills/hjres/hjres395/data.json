    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-498) Makes continuing appropriations for FY 1988. Provides that because the spending levels included in this Act achieve the deficit reduction targets of the Economic Summit, sequestration is no longer necessary. Rescinds sequestration orders issued by the President on October 20, 1987, and November 20, 1987, pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Makes continuing appropriations for FY 1988 for programs, projects, or activities provided for in the following Acts as modified and prescribed under this Act: (1) the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1988, which includes the Department of Commerce Appropriation Act, 1988, the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1988, the Department of State Appropriation Act, 1988, the Judiciary Appropriation Act, 1988, Cuban Political Prisoners and Immigrants, the Indochinese Refugee Resettlement and Protection Act of 1987, and Adjustment to Lawful Resident Status of Certain Nationals of Countries for Which Extended Voluntary Departure Has Been Made Available; (2) the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1988; (3) the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1988; (4) the Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act, 1988; (5) the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1988; (6) the Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988; (7) the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988; (8) the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988, which includes the Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 1988, the Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, 1988, and the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 1988; (9) the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1988; which includes the Congressional Operations Appropriations Act, 1988; (10) the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 1988; (11) the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988; (12) the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988; and (13) the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1988, which includes the Treasury Department Appropriations Act, 1988, the Postal Service Appropriation Act, 1988, the Executive Office Appropriations Act, 1988, and the Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988. Makes appropriations and grants authority under this joint resolution from December 21, 1987, until: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this resolution; (2) enactment of the applicable appropriations Act by both Houses without any provision for such project or activity; or (3) September 30,1988, whichever first occurs. Allows appropriations required to be apportioned to be apportioned on a basis that indicates the need for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation to the extent necessary to permit payment of such pay increases as may be granted pursuant to law to civilian officers and employees and to retired and active military personnel. Requires amounts and authorities provided by this joint resolution to be in accordance with the reports accompanying the bills as passed by or reported to the House and the Senate and in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Conference accompanying this Act. Prohibits in FY 1988 any increase in the rate of pay for any office or position in the legislative, executive, or judicial branch or in the District of Columbia government to a rate exceeding the rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. Prohibits funds appropriated for FY 1988 by this Act from being expended to enter into any contract for the construction or repair of any public building or public work in the United States or U.S. possession with any foreign contractor, subcontractor, or supplier of products whose country denies fair market opportunities to U.S. products or services in procurement or bidding for construction projects funded by that country or by an entity controlled by that country. Authorizes waivers in the public interest. Requires the United States Trade Representative to maintain a list of such countries. Provides a two percent pay increase for Federal employees. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to provide a two percent pay increase for members of the armed forces. Transfers unobligated Department of Defense funds for FY 1987, or for previous years, to the President to provide humanitarian assistance, and for the transportation of such and other assistance, to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance, to remain available through February 29, 1988. Suspends the transportation of lethal assistance to the Nicaraguan resistance and allows for its resumption only if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) at the time of such certification no ceasefire is in place; (2) the failure to achieve such ceasefire results from the lack of good faith efforts by the Government of Nicaragua; and (3) the Nicaraguan resistance has engaged in good faith efforts to achieve such ceasefire.
