    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #12 (78-5)) Rescinds specified disaster relief funds under the Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1987 and made available by Public Laws 99-500 and 99-591. Transfers a specified amount from previously appropriated FY 1987 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster relief funds to the emergency food and shelter program. Transfers from such funds a specified amount to the Veterans Administration (VA) for treatment of chronically mentally ill veterans as provided for by this Act. Amends Federal law to authorize the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to contract for care, treatment, and rehabilitative services in halfway houses, therapeutic communities, psychiatric residential treatment centers, and other community-based treatment facilities of eligible veterans suffering from chronic mental illness disabilities. Includes within such coverage homeless veterans with such disabilities. Requires the Administrator to approve the quality and effectiveness of such program before entering into a contract for such care. Requires the Administrator to designate a VA employee to provide case management services for each veteran provided care and services under this provision. Sets forth the order of priority for providing such care to eligible veterans. Authorizes the Administrator to contract to provide in-kind assistance under this provision. Requires the VA to receive full reimbursement from the contract facility for any such in-kind assistance provided. Directs the Administrator, no later than three years after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees concerning the provision of such services. Disapproves the recommendations of the President relating to pay rates of Members of Congress, Federal judges, and Federal officials under the Executive Schedule. Disapproves a proposed deferral (D87-33) of budget authority for the Department of Agriculture's temporary emergency food assistance program."
