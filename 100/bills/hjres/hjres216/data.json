Declares U.S. policy to support: (1) a cease fire and a negotiated solution to the Iran-Iraq conflict, including a withdrawal to the internationally recognized border; and (2) the establishment of an international tribunal to investigate the origins of the conflict. Expresses the sense of the Congress that if Iran or Iraq rejects peace negotiations and an internationally sanctioned cease fire, including withdrawal to the internationally recognized border, the United States should support internationally approved measures against that country, and maintain existing trade limitations."
