Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should initiate negotiations with the Soviet Union for the purpose of establishing an international medical center in the Soviet Union to treat victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident; (2) such negotiations should include proposals that any concerned government should be allowed to send medical personnel to serve on the staff of such center and that the costs of operating such center should be shared among all participating nations; (3) the United States should participate in such center only if the center's facilities and services are made available to all who need them; and (4) the United States should encourage individuals and organizations from the private sector to donate or loan necessary medical equipment, supplies, and services to such center."
