    "text": "War Powers Amendments of 1989 - Amends the War Powers Resolution to repeal provisions requiring the President to terminate any use of U.S. armed forces: (1) within 60 days after such use is required to be reported to the Congress unless the Congress authorizes their continued use or the President is unable to meet such deadline as a result of an armed attack on the United States; or (2) if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution. Revises provisions concerning congressional action under the War Powers Resolution. Allows the President to continue the use of U.S. armed forces for an additional 30 days beyond that required by a joint resolution enacted by the Congress providing for the withdrawal of U.S. armed forces if the President certifies that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of U.S. armed forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces. Sets forth expedited procedures for the consideration of joint resolutions concerning the use of U.S. armed forces. Repeals provisions relating to concurrent resolutions. Makes certain conforming amendments. Repeals provisions of the Department of State Authorization Act, FY 1984 and 1985 relating to expedited procedures for joint resolutions and bills requiring the removal of U.S. armed forces from hostilities."
