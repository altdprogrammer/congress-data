Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) immediately investigate the scheduling practices of air carriers at major hub airports in order to determine whether such practices make it likely that one or more flights will not depart as scheduled because of the number of flights scheduled at any one time; (2) request air carriers to discuss and agree on schedules if an investigation reveals that scheduling practices make it unlikely for flights to depart as scheduled; and (3) prescribe schedules to ensure that flights are liley to depart as scheduled if the carriers cannot agree upon such schedules among themselves. Requires any air carrier that cancels a flight for reasons other than weather or aviation safety to provide free transportation on the next available flight to the same destination."
