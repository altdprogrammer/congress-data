Terminates such limit on December 31, 1990. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an import licensing system for foreign milk protein products which gives: (1) first preference to importers or users who establish that there are no substitutes for their products; (2) second preference to importers or users who establish that domestically produced skim milk or skim milk solids cannot be substituted for their products; and (3) third preference to all other importers or users. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to reclassify and impose a duty on casein, caseinates, and milk protein concentrate for human food and animal feed use."
