Requires air carriers to enter into an initial agreement, not later than 60 days after enactment, which establishes a conforming operation schedule. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe schedules if air carriers do not enter into such agreement. Authorizes the Administrator to resolve any schedule disputes and to exempt air carriers from the antitrust laws to the extent necessary to implement agreements."
