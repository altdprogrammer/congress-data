    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Federal Property Management Improvement Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to allow surplus government property which is to be sold at fixed sale prices to be offered to specified organizations that have expressed an interest in such property in order to permit them a prior opportunity to make the purchase. Describes such organizations as States, territories, possessions, political subdivisions, or tax-supported agencies. Requires an explanatory statement of the circumstances of each disposal by negotiation of: (1) any personal property which has an estimated fair market value in excess of $15,000; (2) any real property that has an estimated fair market value in excess of $100,000; (3) any real property disposed of by lease for a term of five years or less, if the estimated fair annual rent is in excess of $100,000 for any of such years; (4) any real property disposed of by lease for a term of more than five years, if the total estimated rent over the term of the lease is in excess of $100,000; or (5) any real property or real and related personal property disposed of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property any part of the consideration for which is real property. (Current provisions require such a statement for each disposal by negotiation of any real or personal property having a fair market value in excess of $1,000.) Requires the annual report of the Administrator of General Services to contain a listing and description of any negotiated disposals of surplus property having an estimated fair market value of more than $15,000, in the case of real property, or $5,000, in the case of any other property, other than disposals for which an explanatory statement has been prepared. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress biennially on programs for the donation of Federal surplus property. Requires a copy of such report to be sent to the Comptroller General for review and evaluation. Authorizes the use of proceeds from dispositions of surplus real and related personal property for costs of environmental and historic preservation services. Requires the advice of the Attorney General with respect to the antitrust implications of the disposal of real property if the estimated fair market value is less than $3,000,000 (currently, $1,000,000)."
