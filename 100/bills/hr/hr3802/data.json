Revises provisions concerning coinsurance for post-hospital extended care services to require a reduction in the amount payable for the first seven days of any calendar year. Provides a formula for determining the amount of the coinsurance. Ends the requirement that, in the case of post-hospital extended care services, a physician certify that the services were needed on a daily basis. Provides coverage for post-hospital home health services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that determinations made under Medicare provisions by fiscal intermediaries and carriers with respect to coverage of home health services and post-hospital extended care services are based upon uniform criteria of nationwide application."
