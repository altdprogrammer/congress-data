Declares that the Corporation's purpose is to: (1) acquire feed material for uranium enrichment and for the gas centrifuge technology activities of the Department of Energy; (2) repay the maximum amount of revenue to the Treasury for past uranium enrichment expenditures; and (3) establish a mechanism to convey the Corporation or the centrifuge technology to domestically-controlled private interests. Directs the Secretary of Energy to transfer to the Corporation all properties owned by the Department of Energy which relate to uranium enrichment and gas centrifuge technologies."
