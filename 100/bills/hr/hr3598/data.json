Allocates such safety inspectors to the Research and Special Programs Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Federal Highway Administration. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to subject to a civil penalty any persons who commit violations of such Act (currently such persons must knowingly commit violations). Establishes a minimum civil penalty for violations of such Act or of its regulations. Authorizes appropriations."
