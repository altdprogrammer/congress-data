Requires the Secretary to use such lands to: (1) satisfy the remaining Federal debt to Arizona for relinquishments of land for the Central Arizona Project; and (2) acquire Catalina State Park and other specified lands in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Provides that those lands in the Catalina State Park and Madera-Elephant Head Trail area that are acquired in accordance with this Act shall be included in the National Forest System, and that such Park shall be managed cooperatively by Arizona and Federal authorities. Provides that all lands acquired by the Government under this Act shall be exempt from any further planning requirements of the 1976 National Forest Management Act until the 1986 Coronado Forest Plan is revised, at which time future management direction shall be determined as part of planning for the entire National Forest. Revokes executive and public land orders which withdrew the Santa Rita Experimental Range for a Forest and Range Experiment Station. Withdraws from entry under the public land laws certain lands lying within the Coronado National Forest for use as a Forest and Range Experiment Station administrative headquarters site. Revokes a certain public land order which withdrew lands for forest administrative sites. Places specified Federal lands into the National Wildlife Refuge System as part of the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. Revokes certain orders which withdrew lands from the Colorado River Storage Project, for the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge, for the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge, and in aid of the Salt River Project.
