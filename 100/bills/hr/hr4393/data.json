Permits the reimbursement of attorneys' fees and expenses where a complaint against a Federal judge or magistrate has been dismissed. Title II: National Commission on Judicial Impeachment - National Commission on Judicial Impeachment Act - Establishes the National Commission on Judicial Impeachment to: (1) investigate and study the problems and issues involved in the appointment and tenure (including discipline and removal) of article III judges; (2) evaluate the advisability of proposing alternatives to current arrangements with respect to such problems and issues; and (3) prepare and submit to the Congress, the Chief Justice, and the President a report detailing the findings and conclusions of the Commission. Terminates the Commission 30 days after the submission of such report. Authorizes appropriations."
