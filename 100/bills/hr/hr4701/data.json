    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 with respect to automatic telephone dialing systems (telephone terminal equipment with the capacity to store or produce numbers, dial them, and deliver a prerecorded message without manual assistance). Makes it unlawful for any person in interstate or foreign communications to: (1) use such a system to call anyone on record with a common carrier as objecting to the receipt of such message; or (2) use any automatic telephone dialing system not in compliance with prescribed technical standards that, among other things, provide for release of the receiving party's line within five seconds after that party hangs up. Directs common carriers to maintain a list of persons who notify them of their objection to receiving messages from automatic dialing systems."
