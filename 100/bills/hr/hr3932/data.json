Requires that a specified amount be returned to the Treasury if the former Vice President is the incumbent President. Requires amounts authorized for presidential transition costs to be increased by an inflation adjusted amount to reflect the actual increases in such costs since the previous presidential transition. Requires the President-elect and the Vice President-elect to disclose to the Administrator all private money received for use in their preparation for the assumption of official duties. Requires the Administrator to make such disclosures public. Requires the President-elect and the Vice President-elect to disclose to the public a list of the names of all transition personnel and the most recent employment and source of funding which support the transition activities of such personnel. Requires public disclosures to be made before the initial transition team contacts a Federal department or agency. Prohibits the President-elect and the Vice President-elect from accepting more than $5,000 from any person, organization, or other entity for transition purposes. Authorizes the use of Government aircraft for transition purposes, on a reimbursable basis, if requested by the President-elect or the Vice President-elect, or their designee, and approved by the President. Provides that when the President-elect or the Vice President-elect request the use of a chartered aircraft, any collections received from persons occupying space on such aircraft shall be deposited to the credit of appropriations for presidential transitions. Requires the President-elect and Vice President-elect to provide an estimate to the Administrator of the aggregate value of in-kind contributions made between November 9, 1988, and January 20, 1989, which were received for transition planning purposes for: (1) transportation; (2) hotel and other accommodations; (3) office space; and (4) furniture, furnishings, office machines and equipment, and office supplies. Requires the Administrator to make such information available to the public. Authorizes the payment of certain travel and transportation expenses for any individual performing presidential transition activities. Authorizes the President to fill executive agency vacancies for not more than 120 days (under current law, not more than 30 days), unless a nomination to fill such vacancy has been submitted to the Senate. Declares that if such nomination has been made, the designated person may serve: (1) until the Senate confirms the nomination; (2) for not more than 120 days after the Senate rejects the nomination or the nomination is withdrawn; or (3) if designated when the Congress has adjourned sine die, for no more than 120 days after the Congress next convenes."
