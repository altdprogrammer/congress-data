Requires each State education agency to adopt and implement a plan to ensure that each homeless child within the State is provided full and equal educational opportunities. Requires each local education agency to ensure that qualified personnel interview families and children in temporary housing within their district to determine the educational needs of homeless children. Prohibits any State or local residency requirement from barring any homeless child from attending school. Requires the local education agency where the child is living, subject to the best interest of the child, to: (1) continue the child's education in the district of origin for the remainder of the school year; or (2) enroll the child in the school district where the child is actually living. Makes such choice available regardless of whether the child is living with homeless parents or has been temporarily placed elsewhere by the parents. Requires that each homeless child be provided with adequate transportation to the school selected. Requires that the records of each homeless child be maintained so that they are immediately available when a child enters a new school district. Requires the local educational agency to ensure that each homeless child may participate in all educational programs and services."
