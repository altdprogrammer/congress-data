(Present law prohibits the export of only Alaskan oil.) Defines an \"export refinery\" as any crude oil refinery which would export more than 33 percent of the petroleum products produced by the refinery during a specified period of time. Exempts from such restrictions crude oil and refined or partially refined petroleum products exported to a country adjacent to the United States, if specified conditions are met."
