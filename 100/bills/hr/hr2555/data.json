Applies these provisions to: (1) the spouse of a Member of Congress who files a joint tax return; and (2) a Member's dependent child whose principal place of abode is that of the Member or the Member's spouse. Includes within the term \"Member of Congress\" delegates from American Samoa. Applies such provisions retroactively."
