Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to require that the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress, Delegates to the House of Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, and the Senate and House leadership be the rate payable for such positions on the date of enactment of this Act. Makes it out of order in the House to consider any bill or resolution which adjusts the pay of Members or modifies income tax credits or deductions for Members as a separate and distinct class, unless: (1) it takes effect at the beginning of the subsequent Congress; and (2) it is comprised solely of items adjusting the pay of Members. Requires a record vote on such legislation."
