    "text": "Fishing Vessel Safety Act of 1987 - Title I: Fishing Vessel Safety - Amends Federal law to add fishing vessels to the list of vessels subject to inspection and certification by the Coast Guard. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (the Secretary) to prescribe specified safety regulations for fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels which are not required to be inspected under the revised list and for documented fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels which are operating beyond the Boundary Line. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations for minimum safety standards for fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels and associated equipment. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the operating stability of certain documented fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels. Makes exceptions to specified safety provisions in this Act for certain fish processing vessels. Prohibits operation of a vessel in violation of this Act or in the absence of emergency assignments and periodic emergency drills in compliance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Provides for termination of unsafe operations of fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels. Empowers the Secretary to exempt a vessel from the requirements of this Act. Exempts automatically certain small fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels not operating on the high seas. Establishes civil fines, in rem penalties, and criminal penalties for violations of this Act or its regulations. Sets crew requirements regarding safety training and safety training certification for fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels. Requires operators of such vessels to be licensed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Requires regulations prescribed by the Secretary regarding casualty reports to be uniform for all vessels engaged in commercial service. Requires the Secretary to: (1) compile statistics concerning marine casualties from insurers of fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels; and (2) prescribe regulations to gather a statistical base for analyzing vessel risks. Imposes a civil fine for failure by insurers to comply with collection requirements for marine casualty statistics. Establishes a Fishing Vessel Safety Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on fishing vessel navigation safety, marine insurance, vessel design and operation, personnel training, and other matters. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Committee before taking significant actions.
