Provides that terms or conditions under such contracts shall be no more restrictive for family-building benefits than for obstetrical benefits. Defines \"family-building procedure\" as a medical procedure to overcome infertility (including procedures to achieve pregnancy and to carry pregnancy to term) and procedures relating to child adoption. Requires such contracts to provide that: (1) benefits shall consist of reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses directly relating to the adoption of a child; and (2) benefits shall be available only after the adoption becomes final. Authorizes the use of sick leave for purposes relating to family-building procedures."
