Sets forth elements which must be included in the plan and a specific schedule for FY 1990 through 1992, including requirements relating to an oceanographic research vessel and a fisheries research vessel. Authorizes NOAA to fill 301 additional personnel positions in connection with the modernization and expansion. Requires that an implementation plan be submitted to the Congress. Authorizes the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, notwithstanding specified provisions and if the Under Secretary makes certain findings, to enter into multi-year contracts for the construction, lease, or other acquisition of property, including vessels, and a multi-year charter agreement for a vessel. Authorizes the Under Secretary to provide in each contract or charter agreement for the liability of the United States in the event of termination of the contract or agreement before expiration of its term. Requires all modernization or construction work performed on vessels under this Act to be carried out in private shipyards in the United States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 through 1999."
