Authorizes the Commission to lease office space in the District of Columbia and to contract for necessary services and supplies. Exempts from the ineligibility (for agricultural price supports and other related benefits) provisions of the highly erodible land conservation program, persons who grew alfalfa during the 1981 through 1985 crop years in a rotation practice approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, and who have: (1) submitted an approved soil conservation plan with the Secretary and the local committees; and (2) will comply with such plan by no later than June 1, 1988. Permits acceptance as a conservation plan, with regard to the exemption from loss of agricultural benefits due to crop production on highly erodible land, a Soil Conservation Service-approved certificate of the conservation measures a producer has taken. States that the Secretary of Agriculture, the Soil Conservation Service, and the local soil conservation districts shall minimize the documentation required to obtain such an exemption."
