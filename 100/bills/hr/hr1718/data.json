Requires the infringer to know or be on notice that the product was made by a process patented in the United States before a process patent holder may recover damages. Limits damages for unknowing infringement to reasonable royalties. Makes this provision effective prospectively only. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to report annually to the Congress for five years on the effect of this provision on the importation of manufacturing ingredients in certain domestic industries."
