Mandates that such regulations require that half of the gasoline sold by each refinery in a calendar year shall have ten percent ethanol content; and half shall have a two and one-half percent ethanol content and a five percent methanol content. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend from 1992 until 2000 the excise tax rate reductions applicable to: (1) qualified methanol and ethanol fuel; (2) fuels containing alcohol; (3) gasoline mixed with alcohol; and (4) gasoline used to produce certain alcohol fuels. Provides that the extension of such reductions shall not affect revenue transfers to the Highway Trust Fund."
