    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to establish as the national long-term goal that the air within buildings be as free of radon as the ambient air outside of buildings. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish and make available to the public by June 1, 1989, an updated version of its document titled \"A Citizen's Guide to Radon.\" Sets forth the information which such guide must provide, including information as to the health risk associated with different levels of radon exposure. Requires the Administrator to develop and make available to the public by June 1, 1990, model construction standards and techniques for controlling radon levels within new buildings. Directs the Administrator to develop and implement activities to assist State radon programs such as: (1) an information clearinghouse; (2) proficiency programs rating the effectivenss of radon measurement and mitigation devices, methods, and services; (3) training seminars for government officials and private and professional firms dealing with radon; (4) radon measurement and mitigation methods; and (5) a national data base on the location and amounts of radon. Authorizes the Administrator to provide a State with technical assistance in developing or implementing programs addressing radon. Requires the Administrator to: (1) provide information concerning technology and methods of radon assessment and mitigation to professional organizations representing private firms involved in building design, engineering, and construction; and (2) submit an annual plan to the Congress identifying the assistance to be provided to States for radon programs. Directs the Administrator to impose charges on persons applying for a proficiency rating and on private and professional firms participating in training seminars to defray the costs of such program and seminars. Authorizes appropriations to start such program and seminars. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991 for the development of model construction standards and techniques, publication of the radon guide, and operation of training seminars. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States on an annual basis for radon assessment and mitigation, covering the same types of activities the Administrator may provide directly through technical assistance. Gives preference to States that have made reasonable efforts to ensure the adoption of model construction standards and techniques within the State. Grants priority to State projects which involve serious radon contamination or potential for reduction, including the development of innovative techniques. Limits the Federal share of costs to 75 percent in the first year, 60 percent in the second, and 50 percent in the third. Limits per State grants to ten percent of the total funds available. Places other limitations on the uses of grant money. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Directs the Administrator to study the extent of radon contamination in the Nation's school buildings, including a statistical survey of radon levels in schools in each State and a list of areas which have a high probability of including schools which have elevated radon levels. Requires the Administrator to provide States with a list of high risk areas and other information concerning radon risks, testing, and mitigation. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) provide devices to States for conducting radon tests; and (2) undertake diagnostic and remedial efforts at high radon level school buildings to reduce such radon levels and develop the necessary technology and expertise for use by local educational agencies and States. Sets forth radon study reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Administrator to make grants to at least three colleges, universities, institutions of higher learning, or consortia of such institutions for the establishment and operation of regional radon training centers which develop information and provide training to government officials, professional and private firms, and the public regarding the health risks posed by radon and demonstrated methods of radon measurement and mitigation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires the head of each Federal department or agency that owns a Federal building to conduct, with the Administrator's assistance, a study to determine the extent of radon contamination in such buildings. Directs the Administrator to compile a list of areas that have a high probability of including Federal buildings with elevated radon levels. Requires that such studies be completed by June 1, 1990, and their results reported to the Congress by October 1, 1990."
