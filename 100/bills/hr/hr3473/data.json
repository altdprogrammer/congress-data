Sets forth the matching requirements by State and local governments for FY 1988. Sets a ceiling of Federal funds per program of $500,000. Mandates as a prerequisite for such grant that the recipient demonstrate to the Secretary that it will implement a program for disposing of hazardous materials contained in such vehicles in an environmentally safe manner. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989. Requires the Secretary to study: (1) the number of abandoned vehicles and the scope of the problems (including environmental and safety hazards) caused by such vehicles; and (2) a methodology for developing a permanent reclamation program for such vehicles. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year after enactment of this Act regarding such study results, including recommendations for a trust fund which would be financed by a surcharge on the vehicle manufacturer, and which would fund the reclamation program."
