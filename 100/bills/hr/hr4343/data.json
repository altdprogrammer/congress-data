Outlines the contents of such report. Requires the Secretary to evaluate potential alternatives to meet petroleum demand scenarios on a consistent basis. Requires the Secretary to prepare a study of present and future oil and gas development in the Alaskan Arctic regions, (excluding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). Outlines the study contents. Requires that the energy plan and study be accompanied by a certain report incorporating a legislative action recommendation concerning the future management of specified lands under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (Coastal Plain lands). Prohibits oil or gas exploration or production within the Coastal Plain, including land exchanges or leasing activities leading to production or exploration, until authorized by an Act of Congress."
