Lowers to $500 (currently $5,000) the threshold commercial or archaeological value of an archaeological resource (including cost of restoration or repair) above which, for certain violations of the Act, specified criminal penalties are mandated. Directs each Federal land manager to: (1) establish a program to increase public awareness of the significance of, and the need to protect, archaeological resources located on public lands and Indian lands; and (2) report annually to specified congressional committees on actions taken under such program."
