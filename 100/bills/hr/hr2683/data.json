(Current law does not say \"generic or specific.\") Authorizes the Department of Energy to issue regulations regarding trespass or the introduction of dangerous materials or instruments upon any property or facility subject to its jurisdiction, administration, custody, or licensing authority. Applies certain criminal penalty provisions to persons who willfully destroy or damage a nuclear facility during its construction where the action could affect public health and safety if undetected before operation. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to authorize the Commission to issue regulations requiring firms subject to defect disclosure requirements to implement procedures to identify, evaluate, and report defects in a nuclear facility or activity. Makes such firms directly responsible for failure to notify the Commission. Subjects to a civil penalty any individual who knowingly and consciously fails to provide such notice."
