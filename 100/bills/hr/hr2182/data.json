Sets December 1 of such year as the effective date for such rules. Authorizes the Supreme Court to determine the extent such rules shall apply to proceedings then pending, except that the Supreme Court shall not require the application of such rule to further proceedings then pending to the extent that, in the opinion of the court in which such proceedings are pending, the application of such rule in such proceedings would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former rule applies. Requires the Conference periodically to compile rules and orders with regard to procedures dealing with judicial discipline. Requires the Conference periodically to review the procedural rules for consistency with the Conference's rules of practice, procedure, and evidence.
