Directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine the mineral character of such lands and the fair market value of the mineral interests. Requires the College to pay to the United States: (1) any administrative costs incurred by the United States in conveying such mineral interests to the College; and (2) the fair market value of such mineral interests; or (3) one dollar, if the Secretary of the Interior determines that such mineral interests have no value."
