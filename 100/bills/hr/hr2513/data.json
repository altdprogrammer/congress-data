    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries with amendment, H. Rept. 100-740 (Part I)) Requires the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Chief of the Corps of Engineers, with the Director of the Department of Fish and Game of the State of California (if such Director elects to participate), to jointly undertake a study of the fishery resources and habitats of the Russian River Basin in California, develop goals and short-term and long-term recommendations for maximizing the restoration and conservation of the resources and habitats, and submit the study and recommendations to the Congress. Requires a joint memorandum of understanding setting forth the responsibilities of each agency in carrying out the study. Designates that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the lead agency. Requires consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service, commercial and recreational fishing interests, local governments, and (if the California Director elects not to directly participate) the California Department of Fish and Game. Sets forth required elements of the study. Requires the State of California, if the California Director elects to participate, to pay, from non-Federal sources, one-third of the cost of the study. Allows that payment to include in-kind contributions, including personal services rendered by volunteers meeting qualifications established by the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Directs the Secretary of the Army to extend until October 1, 1991, the permit issued to the Cazadero Dam committee for the construction of summer dams and beaches in specified tributaries. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army for FY 1990 and 1991."
