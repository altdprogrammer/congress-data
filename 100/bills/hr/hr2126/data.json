Authorizes the Inspector General to investigate information received from Commission employees regarding violations, fraud, gross waste of funds, or a danger to the public safety. Prohibits any reprisal action taken against an employee for making a complaint or disclosing information to an Inspector General. Establishes in the Commission the Office of Investigations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Prescribes the oversight responsibilities of the Director regarding the investigation of non-compliance with radiological health and safety laws on the part of Commission licensees, permittees, applicants, contractors, and vendors. Requires the Director to appoint a Deputy Director and an Assistant Director. Confers responsibility upon the Assistant Director for supervising investigations conducted by the Commission's regional offices. Requires the Director to submit semiannual reports to the Commission (which in turn shall submit them to the Congress) summarizing the activities of the Office of Investigations. Transfers the Commission's Office of Inspector and Auditor to the Office of Inspector General of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. States that no person may restrict the communication of any Commission employee with a member of Congress or the Inspector General regarding: (1) possible violations of law; or (2) mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to the public safety. Prohibits retaliatory personnel actions against Commission employees for making such a protected communication. Requires the Inspector General to: (1) investigate any allegations by a Commission employee regarding such violations or retaliatory actions; and (2) report investigation results to the Commission. Sets forth remedies for victims of retaliatory actions."
