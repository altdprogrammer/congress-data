Authorizes the Governors of a majority of States in a marine research region to develop and submit for approval to the Marine Research Coordination Board (Board) a combined, interstate proposal for a Center which identifies the research organizations which will participate in the Center and the goals of such Center. Identifies the marine research regions as the Gulf of Maine, Greater New York Bight, Mid-Atlantic Bight, Tropical, Gulf of Mexico, Southern California Bight, North Pacific, Gulf of Alaska and Arctic Seas, Insular Pacific, and Great Lakes Regions. Requires each Center to develop and submit for the Board's approval every three years a marine research plan which: (1) identifies research needs and priorities in the region over the next ten years; (2) inventories all federally-funded projects regarding the marine environment expected to be conducted in the region during the three-year term of the plan; (3) explains the means by which the Center will select and supervise projects to be funded under this Act; (4) describes each project expected to be assisted with appropriations authorized pursuant to this Act; and (5) lists the equipment and supplies used commonly for research projects in the region. Authorizes the Board to make annual administrative, research, and equipment grants to Centers which submit applications for such grants. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires each Center to support baseline monitoring of fundamental marine environmental conditions and submit periodic reports on the status of marine environmental quality and resources in the region to the Board. Requires that such reports be made available to the public, State Governors, and local, State, and Federal agencies. Authorizes the establishment of the Marine Research Coordination Board at the Federal level to manage and coordinate the efforts of the Centers and report periodically to the Congress on the activities and findings of such Centers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993."
