Sets forth certain features of such coins and provides for their design, issuance, and sale. Terminates the minting of such coins after June 30, 1990. Requires the Secretary to deposit in the Treasury all surcharges received from the sale of such coins, to be used to reduce the national debt. Declares that no law governing procurement or public contracts is applicable to the procurement of goods and services for carrying out this Act, except that this provision does not relieve any person from complying with any law relating to equal employment opportunity. Extends for one year, until August 10, 1989, the moratorium on voluntary termination of Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation insured status. Repeals all provisions of this Act, except for those relating to the extension of the moratorium on termination of FSLIC insured status, on the day after the date of enactment of this Act. Declares that no person shall be liable for not complying with the repealed provisions while they are in effect."
