Requires the Small Business Administration to promulgate regulations for the prepayment of such loans, and to devise and implement a plan to notify the borrower of any such loan that such loan may be refinanced if the borrower takes action within one year after regulations are issued. Grants any certified development company which is the holder of any such debenture the right of first refusal with respect to the refinancing. Requires the Administration to issue regulations to implement this Act within 60 days after its enactment."
