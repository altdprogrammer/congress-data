Transfers all interests in lands held by the Band to the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Band. Requires the Band to transfer to the United States any interest in lands acquired after enactment of this Act. Provides that such lands shall constitute the Band's reservation. Authorizes the Band to adopt a constitution that will take effect only after being filed with the Secretary of the Interior. Limits membership in the Band, until a constitution is adopted, to every individual who: (1) is named in the tribal membership roll in effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or (2) is a descendant of any such individual.
