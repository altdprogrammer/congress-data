    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1987 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission for FY 1988 and 1989. Precludes the FCC from enforcing any regulation that prevents the receipt of any information from the Congress. Extends through FY 1989 the authority for the Commission's travel reimbursement program. Repeals the requirement for the Commission to submit an annual management report to the Congress. Provides for the Commission to review its Schedule of Charges and adjust such Schedule to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index every two years after April 1, 1987 (currently, April 7, 1986). Authorizes the Commission, during FY 1988 and 1989, to make grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, private nonprofit organizations to use older Americans in providing technical and administrative assistance for projects related to the implementation, promotion, or enforcement of the Commission's regulations. Requires the Commission to certify that such action will not result in: (1) displacing the Commission's current employees; (2) employing any individual when someone else is on layoff status from the same job; (3) filling a position prior to publicly announcing it and prior to attempting to fill it under normal procedures; or (4) affecting existing contracts for services. Requires participants in any program under such a grant or cooperative agreement to execute: (1) a statement certifying compliance with the Commission's standards of conduct; and (2) a statement of employment and financial interest. Prohibits the employment of program participants in policymaking positions."
