Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress if such minimum requirements are not met, citing the reasons for such noncompliance, and the steps proposed to ensure compliance. Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to review within six months after enactment of this Act whether the Departments of Defense and Transportation are placing systems-specialist positions in classes and grades conforming to published standards and to take any corrective action necessary. Requires OPM to report to the Congress (and to the Secretaries of Transportation and Defense) the results of a mandated review of training and promotion procedures and special pay rates for airways systems specialists. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to ensure that at least 75 percent of all systems specialists employed by the Department by September 30, 1992, are at the journeyman level and to submit a written report to the Congress if such requirement has not been met. Mandates that: (1) the overtime hourly rate of pay for airways systems specialists equal one and one half times the hourly basic pay; (2) all such amount be premium pay; and (3) standby status entitle such specialists to premium pay at specified maximum levels. Directs OPM to prescribe regulations regarding home leave for airways systems specialists attending the Federal Aviation Administration Academy for specified lengths of stay. Prescribes a minimum per diem allowance for the training period at such Academy."
