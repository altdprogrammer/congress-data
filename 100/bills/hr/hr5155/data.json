    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Amendments Act of 1988 - Amends the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 to redefine the terms \"abuse\" and \"neglect\" to include acts which result in the death of a mentally ill individual. Includes within such Act's coverage persons who are in the process of being transported to a facility for admission or who are involuntarily confined in a municipal detention facility for reasons other than a criminal conviction. Sets forth requirements for the responsibilities and composition of State governing boards. Makes State governing boards responsible for: (1) developing, jointly with the system advisory council, the annual priorities of the system established to protect and advocate the rights of the mentally ill; and (2) the planning, design, implementation, and functioning of the system. Includes among the responsibilities of the system advisory council giving advice on ongoing policies and priorities and annual plans, priorities, and reports. Requires each system to include in its annual report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a section prepared by the advisory council that describes the activities of the council and its assessment of the operations of the system. Grants the system access to all records of any individual who has died or whose whereabouts are unknown. Encourages systems to consider subcontracting with: (1) groups run by individuals who are receiving mental health services; and (2) family members of the mentally ill. Increases the percentage of funds which may be used by systems for training and technical assistance. Limits the percentage of appropriated funds which may be used by the Secretary to provide technical assistance for eligible systems. Requires each eligible system to: (1) provide the public with a mechanism to comment on the priorities and activities of the system; and (2) establish a grievance procedure for clients and prospective clients of the system. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991 for allotments under such Act."
