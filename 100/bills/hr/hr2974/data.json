    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) Amends Federal armed forces provisions to require that if a regularly scheduled adjustment in military retired and retainer pay (to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)) is not made by reason of law, then the next increase in such pay should be adjusted to account for such previously precluded increase. Revises provisions relating to the prorating of initial CPI increase adjustments for new retirees. Revises provisions relating to the computation at age 62 of military retired pay and Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) amounts available to persons who first became members of the armed forces after July 31, 1986, and to members of the armed forces who retired, then returned to active duty after such date, and then retired once again. Provides that, for such members, the amount of military retired pay to which they are eligible will be recomputed to take into account changes in the cost-of-living and CPI adjustments since the date of their initial retirement from the armed forces. Makes identical recomputation adjustments for such members who are SBP participants to take into account cost-of-living and CPI adjustments since initial retirement in the base amount of SBP benefits for which such member's dependents will be eligible. Excludes reserve members on active duty only for training from the protection afforded other members of the reserves serving on active duty from being involuntarily released from such duty within two years of becoming eligible for retired or retainer pay (unless such release is approved by the Secretary of the military department concerned)."
