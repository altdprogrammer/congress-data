Requires each title to be assigned a bill number and considered separately. Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives and the Senate: (1) to consider such bill or joint resolution unless each title corresponds to a regular appropriation bill; and (2) for any general provisions of such bill or joint resolution to not be contained in the appropriate title. Excludes any bill or joint resolution making supplemental appropriations from provisions of this Act. Makes such Act applicable to FY 1988, 1989, and 1990."
