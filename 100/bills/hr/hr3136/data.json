    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1987-08-06", 
    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Defense (the Secretary) to develop a plan for the detection, intervention, prevention, and treatment of child abuse on military installations. Requires such plan to be revised not less than one year after its initial development and not less than once every three years thereafter. Requires each plan developed, as well as each update, to be submitted to the Congress. Outlines features to be included in the plan developed under this Act, including the training of appropriate personnel on military installations in the detection, investigation, and treatment of child abuse on such installations. Directs the Secretary to consult with appropriate agencies in developing such plan. Directs the Secretary to establish a task force to make recommendations to the Secretary concerning coordination and integration of services pertaining to the detection, intervention, prevention, and treatment of child abuse in order to maximize available resources. Directs the Secretary to establish a child protection team for each military installation to provide, on a 24-hour-a-day basis, specialized diagnostic assessment, evaluation, consultation, and other supportive services as specified. Requires a child protection team for a military installation to begin an investigation of each report of child abuse on such installation within 24 hours of the time such report is received. Requires such team to begin such an investigation immediately if it appears from the report that: (1) the family concerned may flee; (2) the child will be endangered; (3) the child will be unavailable for purposes of conducting the investigation; or (4) the facts otherwise so warrant. Requires each team, in conducting such an investigation, to: (1) determine the composition of the family or household; (2) determine whether there is any indication that any child in the family or household is abused; (3) determine the immediate and long-term risk to each child if the child remains in the existing home environment; (4) determine the protective treatment and services necessary to safeguard and ensure the child's well-being and development; and (5) whenever possible, seek to interview the child concerned in a neutral setting, other than where the abuse occurred. Directs each such child protection team, within three days of receiving a child abuse report, to submit a report of child abuse to the commanding officer of the military installation involved. Directs the Secretary to designate an appropriate officer at each military installation for purposes of taking a child into protective custody, without the consent of the parents or legal guardians, if the circumstances are such that continuing the child in the child's place of residence presents an imminent danger to the child in the child's place of residence, or when circumstances indicate the need for a medical examination. Authorizes a child to be kept under such protective custody until the next regular session of the appropriate court or tribunal, or for as long as ordered by such court or tribunal. Requires any officer who takes such a child to immediately notify the commanding officer of such installation that he or she has done so. Requires such commanding officer to then: (1) initiate an investigation by the child protection team for the military installation; and (2) make every reasonable effort to notify the parents or legal guardians of the child that the child has been taken into protective custody. Requires a commanding officer to similarly notify such parents or legal guardians in the case of institutional child abuse in an institution on a military installation. Presumes a child under the age of 13 to be competent as a witness for purposes of an investigation into an offense allegedly committed against such child."
