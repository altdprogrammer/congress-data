    "text": "Bus Regulatory Reform Act Amendments of 1987 - Requires the Interstate Commerce Commission (the Commission), when considering a petition for the discontinuance of bus transportation within on State, to take into account the extent to which interstate and intrastate revenues are less than the variable costs of transportation (currently it has to accord great weight to such revenues). Requires the Commission, when considering such a petition, to accord great weight to whether the transportation is the last motor carrier of passenger service to such point, and whether a reasonable alternative to such service is available. Requires the Commission, when making any findings related to the public interest concerning public transportation certification, to accord great weight to the recommendations of each State in which the transportation to be authorized will be provided. Declares that it is the Federal transportation policy to coordinate State and Federal regulatory actions to ensure bus service to rural communities which have no other means of public transportation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Commission, the States, and national associations representing governmental agencies should cooperate in developing innovative regulatory approaches to ensure the preservation of bus service in areas which are threatened with the total loss of public transportation service."
