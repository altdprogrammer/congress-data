    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1988-06-28", 
    "text": "Pesticide Food Safety Act of 1988 - Title I: Pesticide Registration - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to make it the responsibility of each registrant to apply for the reregistration of such registrant's pesticides within a specified time frame. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): (1) to review the data and either reregister the pesticide or notify the registrant that the data is insufficient; (2) to permit sufficient time for applicants to obtain any requested information; and (3) in reviewing an application for reregistration, to consider the adequacy of regulations promulgated for such pesticide under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Permits the prior registration of a pesticide to remain in effect until the Administrator makes a final decision, in the event a hearing is requested following issuance of a notice of denial (but allows the Administrator to initiate action to suspend such registration). Makes failure to meet hearing and final decision time limits grounds for a civil action. Establishes schedules for reregistration of pesticides initially registered or reregistered post-1978 and pre-1978. Makes reregistration the functional equivalent of registration. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1995. Directs the Administrator, in making determinations under FIFRA concerning unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of a pesticide that results in a post-harvest residue in or on food, feed crops, or processed food, to consider ways in which the consumer may be affected by such residues and by such pesticide. Revises procedures governing cancellation of pesticide registration after expiration of the period for registration. Prohibits the continued sale of a pesticide for more than a year after the effective date of a cancellation or denial notice or order, except that, in extraordinary circumstances, the period may be extended if in the public interest. Title II: Pesticide Residues - Amends the FFDCA to include in the definition of \"pesticide chemical\": (1) any substance used in the production, storage, or transportation of processed food; and (2) as the Administrator deems appropriate, any active or inert ingredient of a pesticide or substance present in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food as a result of the metabolism or other degradation of a pesticide. Revises the definition of \"food additive\" to exclude pesticide chemicals in or on, or used in the production, storage, or transportation of, any processed food. Revises what is deemed \"adulterated food\": (1) as it relates to pesticide chemicals; and (2) to include a new animal drug (or conversion product thereof) which is unsafe. Makes the FFDCA provisions relating to tolerances for pesticide chemicals applicable to chemicals in processed food (currently, such provisions only apply to those in or on raw agricultural commodities). Precludes the Administrator from establishing or leaving in effect a tolerance above a level deemed to be associated with a negligible risk to human health for pesticide chemicals which raise prudent concerns of oncogenic risks on the basis of a validated test and other evidence, unless the Administrator: (1) finds clear and convincing evidence that the benefits to consumers associated with such a tolerance in terms of an adequate, wholesome, and economical food supply outweigh the risks; or (2) takes appropriate action under the FFDCA or FIFRA to substantially reduce the dietary risks associated with the use of an alternative pesticide chemical for control of the same pest on the same crop, where such alternative poses greater risks than the first. Requires relative risk determinations to be based on actual usage of such pesticide chemicals and on residue levels anticipated routinely in or on raw agricultural commodities or processed foods. Provides that where a pesticide chemical has been used on a raw agricultural commodity in conformity with a granted exemption or a prescribed tolerance and such commodity has been processed, the residue of the chemical in the processed food shall not be deemed to be unsafe if it has been removed to the extent possible in good manufacturing practice and the residue concentration is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the commodity. Directs the Administrator to modify or revoke any exemption from the requirement of a tolerance to the extent necessary to protect the public health. Title III: Integrated Pest Management - National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act Amendments of 1988 - Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act Amendments of 1985 to establish within the office of the Administrator an interagency committee to oversee coordination between the Department of Agriculture's conservation, commodity, research, and education programs and the EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. States that the committee's mission is to design an integrated pest management (IPM) initiative, focusing on developing economical pest control techniques and the reduction of pesticide residues associated with traditional production practices for minor crops when such reduction may lessen dietary risk from pesticide residues. Directs the interagency committee to: (1) develop IPM research and education initiatives targeted toward principal pests of minor crops; (2) report to the Congress annually regarding the committee's activities and funding; (3) report on policy recommendations or other agricultural or regulatory programs which warrant congressional attention regarding on-farm use of safer, efficient pest control methods and technologies; and (4) advise the Administrator regarding the implications of genetic resistance to pesticides in pest populations and the viability and profitability of IPM systems with regard to registration, reregistration, and cancellation actions. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture and Administrator to develop and submit to the Congress studies of: (1) policy and programmatic barriers to the adoption of IPM systems and other management practices; and (2) the impact of extending coverage under the Federal Crop Insurance Program to cover pest losses suffered by farmers applying recommended IPM techniques when such losses are determined to result from unanticipated natural and biological events that unavoidably reduce the effectiveness of IPM practices. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1994. Amends Federal provisions relating to competitive grants under the Department of Agriculture's agricultural research program to include research to develop and refine IPM techniques and other pest control technologies targeted toward major pests of minor use crops among the areas designated as high priority research."
