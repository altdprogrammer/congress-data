    "text": "Youth Employment Opportunity Wage Act of 1987 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to authorize employers to pay employees under 20 years of age, between May and September of each year, 75 percent of the minimum wage rate. Exempts such employees from special certificate requirements. Restricts such authorization to: (1) hours worked by eligible employees in compliance with applicable child labor laws; and (2) youth employed after May 1 of each year. Prohibits the removal of employees ineligible for the subminimum wage rate in order to replace them with employees who are eligible. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act. Terminates the minimum wage rate exception after September 30, 1989. Directs the Secretary of Labor to monitor the implementation of this Act and to report to the Congress concerning the employment effects of the wage authorized by this Act."
