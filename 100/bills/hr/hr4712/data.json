Establishes the Office of Government Ethics as an independent agency within the executive branch. (The Office is currently under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management.) Requires the Director to make an annual report to the Congress. Requires the Director to ensure that each executive agency has established procedures on how the agency is to collect, review, evaluate, and make public financial disclosure statements filed by its officers or employees. Requires the Director to prescribe regulations under which each executive agency shall be required to report to the Office on a description and evaluation of the agency's ethics program. Requires each agency to notify the Director regarding ethics matters that refer to officials outside the agency. Authorizes the Director to order specific corrective action for agencies based on failure to establish an ethics program or to modify such program. Authorizes the Director to recommend corrective action for any officer or employee found to have violated any law, rule, regulation, or Executive order relating to conflicts of interest, standards of conduct, or financial disclosure."
