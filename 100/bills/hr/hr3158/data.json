    "text": "Air Travelers' Bill of Rights - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to require commercial air carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers in the United States (including foreign air and commuter air carriers) to report to the Secretary on a monthly basis specified information regarding flight delays, cancellations, reroutings, luggage status performance, and \"bumped\" passengers. Requires the Secretary to make such information available to the public at all public airports in a timely fashion. Directs the Secretary to require that each such air carrier disclose to each passenger at the time of ticket purchase specified information regarding flight cancellations, overbookings, delays, liability for luggage, and to provide a complaints and comments form regarding carrier service. Prohibits any air carrier from cancelling a flight for economic reasons unless reasonable efforts are made to notify each passenger and to make similar service available within a reasonable time. Directs the Secretary to require that air carriers provide passengers with: (1) a written explanation whenever a flight has been delayed by more than three hours; and (2) accommodations for carry-on hanging baggage on each aircraft with seating for 15 or more passengers. Establishes a civil penalty for violations of regulations under this Act."
