Authorizes the President to restore any terminated trade or defense agreement or terminate any import restriction if he determines that New Zealand has rescinded or modified its policy of restricting access of U.S. nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed naval vessels to its ports. Authorizes the President to terminate any defense cooperation and trade agreements providing for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of barriers to trade between the United States and any nation that restricts access of such U.S. naval vessels to its ports.
