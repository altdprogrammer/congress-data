Requires such Plan to address the sediment starvation of such wetlands, including: (1) an analysis of the need for river water diversion, increased flow, or navigation locks or channels; (2) the feasibility of repairing such lands; and (3) the role of government programs in developing and implementing such Plan. Limits the Federal share to a maximum of 75 percent. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989."
