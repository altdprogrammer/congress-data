Requires the Secretary to make payments to persons denied program assistance on such grounds. Directs and authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations requiring that a determination of any farm program application provision must be made within 45 days of approval by a county committee (with exceptions for redeterminations involving fraud or substantial noncompliance)."
