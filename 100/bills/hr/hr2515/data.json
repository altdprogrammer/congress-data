Entitles witnesses appearing before a grand jury to have the right to counsel during questioning. Provides that such counsel may not address the grand jury, raise objections, make arguments, or otherwise disrupt the proceedings. Allows the court to: (1) exclude such counsel from the grand jury room or take other measures necessary to assure that the counsel complies with such restrictions; and (2) order separate representation of witnesses."
