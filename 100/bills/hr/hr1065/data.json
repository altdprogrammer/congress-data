Mandates that such regulations require that at least 30 days before the owner or operator of any major fuel burning installation may obtain coal mined outside the United States such owner or operator notify the Secretary in writing with a statement expressing the bona fide intention to obtain such coal. Details the contents of such notice, especially price information. Requires the Secretary to place appropriate notices setting forth such information in the Federal Register and in a publication widely read by the coal industry. Requires owners or operators to notify the Secretary in writing regarding a cost comparison of foreign coal offers and domestic coal offers received during a 20-day waiting period. Requires the Secretary to publish such information in the same publications. Permits such owners or operators to obtain coal from any supplier ten days after publication of the cost comparison data. Subjects any person who violates this Act to a specified civil penalty."
