Limits the total cost of the project (taking into account funding from all sources). Authorizes appropriations to the Board for FY 1989 and subsequent fiscal years in an amount equal to one-half the total cost of the project. Prohibits any such appropriations from being used for any purpose until the Comptroller General determines that an amount equal to one-half of the total cost of the project is available to the Board from non-Federal sources. Provides for transfer of any portion of such funds to the General Services Administration to carry out such project. Provides that the Cooper-Hewitt Museum shall also be known as the National Museum of Design."
