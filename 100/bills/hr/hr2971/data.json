    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987 - Amends the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act to extend the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to provide cotton classification services and to collect fees for such services through FY 1992. Provides that the uniform cotton per bale classification for a crop year shall be the previous year's fee, exclusive of prior adjustments, and as may be adjusted for the percentage change in the Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product as indexed during the most recent 12-month period. Provides that the uniform per bale classification fee for a crop year may be increased, or decreased, by up to one percent for every 100,000 bales produced below, or above, 12,500,000 bales. Stipulates that such adjustments shall not exceed 15 percent unless fees and other income sources will not provide an ending operating reserve of at least ten percent of estimated operating expenses. Authorizes the Secretary to add a special surcharge or up to five cents a bale if the projected fiscal year ending reserve is less than 25 percent of estimated operating expenses. Prohibits the Secretary from establishing a uniform per bale classification fee if (when combined with other revenues and adjusted for expenses) doing so will result in a projected operating reserve of more than 25 percent. States that the Secretary should continue to recognize that central billing can reduce administrative costs. Directs the Secretary to announce: (1) the uniform classification fee and any crop surcharge by June 1 of the year that such fee applies; and (2) the FY 1987 fee as soon as practicable after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study (and perform testing as necessary) of the differences between processing efficiency and product quality for Light Spotted and White grade cottons; (2) conduct a survey and research to determine why an increasing proportion of the cotton crop is being classified as Light Spotted; and (3) submit an initial report to the appropriate congressional committees by October 1, 1988, and a final report as soon as practicable."
