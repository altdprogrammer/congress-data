    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) Nursing Shortage Reduction and Education Extension Act of 1988 - Title I: Special Projects - Replaces provisions of title VIII (Nursing Education) of the Public Health Service Act relating to nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds with a new subpart on the same topic. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants and enter into contracts for special projects to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Prohibits the Secretary from approving or disapproving an application for a grant or contract until after consultation with the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Removes provisions authorizing the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for special projects to: (1) provide retraining for nurses after periods of professional inactivity; (2) demonstrate clinical nurse education programs which combine educational curricula and clinical practice; and (3) demonstrate methods to encourage nursing graduates to practice in health manpower shortage areas. Replaces provisions authorizing grants and contracts for continuing education for nurses with provisions authorizing the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for special projects to demonstrate improved geriatric nursing training. Replaces provisions authorizing grants and contracts to increase the supply or improve the distribution of nurses with provisions authorizing the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for special projects to: (1) increase the supply of nurses, including bilingual nurses, to meet the needs of rural areas; and (2) provide nursing education via satellite. Revises the description of nursing education special projects eligible for certain grants and contracts with regard to: (1) priorities in training and education to upgrade the skills of paraprofessional nursing personnel; (2) development of curricula for certain nursing baccalaureate degree situations. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for special projects to collect the names and addresses of health facilities and nursing students and nurses willing to enter into agreements under which the facilities would repay the educational loans of the individual. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for geriatric nursing training. Requires applications for grants and contracts to be subject to peer review. Prohibits the Secretary from approving or disapproving an application unless the Secretary has received recommendations from the peer review group and has consulted with the Advisory Council on Nurses Education. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for demonstrating innovative hospital nursing practice models which include restructuring the role of the nurse, testing innovative wage structures, and evaluating the effectiveness of various benefits. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to nurse training entities: (1) to demonstrate innovative nursing practice models for services in the home and to demonstrate innovative nursing practice models for services in the home and long-term care facilities designed to increase recruitment and retention of nurses and improve nursing care; and (2) to develop projects to increase the exposure of nursing students to clinical practice in nursing home, home health, and gerontologic settings. Authorizes appropriations for grants and contracts for special projects in nurse education and for advanced nurse education for FY 1989 through 1991. Revises the guidelines for programs for the education of nurse practitioners and nurse midwives to require that they have not less than six full-time equivalent students. (Current law requires that they have eight students.) Allows service commitments by nurse practitioner or nurse midwife traineeship recipients to include services in an Indian Health Service health center, a Native Hawaiian health center, a migrant health center, a rural health clinic, or a community health center in addition to the currently allowed service in a health manpower shortage area or a public health care facility.
