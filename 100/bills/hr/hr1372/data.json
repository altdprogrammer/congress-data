Directs the State health commissioner to develop programs to identify, investigate, and report on incidents of professional negligence and to encourage facilities to take action to prevent future negligence. Fixes a statute of limitations for professional negligence actions. Encourages States to permit parties to a claim filed with a panel to enter into a settlement agreement at any time prior to a panel decision. Subjects such a settlement to the same attorney fee schedule that governs panel decisions.

Requires the Governor of a recipient State to report to the Attorney General within one year after receipt of payment concerning the use of such payment. Authorizes the Attorney General to determine the allocation of funds to qualifying States and prescribes guidelines for such determinations. Empowers the Attorney General to make decisions concerning compliance with this Act, termination of allocations and repayment of funds in the event of noncompliance, and reallocation of funds according to guidelines in this Act. Sets forth procedures, a timetable, and standards to govern application by the Governor of any State for the certification of programs to qualify a State for funding under this Act. Makes decisions by the Attorney General concerning noncompliance, the termination of allocations, State repayment of funds, and the reallocation of funds final and not subject to judicial review. Directs the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national data base and computer tracking system to monitor health professionals sanctioned for disciplinary reasons.
