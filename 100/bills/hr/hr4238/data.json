Allows Institute funds to be used to conduct research on alternative means for using judicial personnel in court decisionmaking activities. Provides that such funds may no longer be used to assist State and local courts in meeting requirements of Federal law applicable to recipients of Federal funds. States that grant recipients who file a timely application for refunding shall no longer receive automatic interim funding. Establishes certain restrictions on the disclosure of information by officers and employees of the Institute, and by recipients of Institute assistance."
