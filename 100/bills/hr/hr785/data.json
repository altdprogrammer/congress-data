    "text": "Automated Teller Machine Crime Prevention Act of 1987 - Amends the Bank Protection Act of 1968 to require each Federal supervisory agency to prescribe minimum security standards for the protection of customers using automated teller machines owned or operated by banks or savings and loan associations. Directs each agency to consider the need for emergency alarms, surveillance cameras and video transaction recorders, and secure enclosures at such machines and the need for a program to educate machine customers about how to protect themselves. Requires such standards to be voluntary for three years and mandatory thereafter. Requires each agency, within three years after enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on compliance with such standards. Directs the Attorney General to acquire and include in the uniform crime reports information on crimes committed in connection with the use of automated teller machines. Increases criminal penalties for violations of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act."
