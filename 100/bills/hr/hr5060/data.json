Title II: Enforcement Provisions - Part A: Conforming Amendments - Amends the Federal laws referred to in title I to provide that requirements applicable to legislative branch employees shall be enforced in accordance with this title II.

Part C: Complaints of Violations - Allows any individual who claims to be aggrieved by a violation of any law referred to in title I, or any employee or officer authorized to conduct inspections and investigations under such laws, to file a charge with the Office of the General Counsel for Employment Practices alleging such violation and stating a claim for relief authorized under this part. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) filing of such charges; (2) investigations, determinations, appointments, and qualifications of investigating counsels; and (3) hearings and determinations of hearing examiners. Directs the hearing examiner, upon finding a violation, to issue and serve a cease and desist order. Allows such order also to require the defendant to take any of the following actions: (1) employment or reinstatement of the complainant under appropriate terms and conditions with specified exceptions; (2) payment of compensatory damages; (3) payment of up to two years' double backpay; (4) payment of up to two years' frontpay; and/or (5) payment of witnesses' fees and allowances and attorney's fees. Prohibits the Board from compelling any Member of Congress or Senator, or their staff members, to employ, reinstate, or modify terms and conditions of employment of any individual to any position on their staff. Requires any such ordered payments to be paid from the contingent fund of the House or the Senate, as appropriate. Directs examiners to dismiss a complaint if they determine that, upon the preponderance of the evidence, the defendant has not violated any such law. Sets forth provisions relating to subpoenas and service of process. Provides for review and enforcement of final orders. Provides for review by the Board of hearing examiners' orders, upon appeal. Provides for judicial review of final orders, upon appeal, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, with further review by the U.S. Supreme Court upon writ of certiorari or certification.
