Directs the Attorney General to make the first such appointment not more than 30 days after enactment of this Act. Sets forth transitional provisions and certain powers and responsibilities of the Administrator. Applies Federal laws governing the administration of Federal penal and correctional institutions to the District of Columbia Department of Corrections, except as determined by the Attorney General. Prohibits this Act from being construed: (1) as an assumption by the Federal Government of the financial responsibility for incarceration of individuals; or (2) to require use of Federal penal or correctional institutions. Directs the Administrator, directly or by contract, to conduct a study of alternative sentencing in the District of Columbia."
