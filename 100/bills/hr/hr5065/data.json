    "text": "Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to authorize additional annual appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to be made available by the Secretary of the Interior only for the acquisition of development rights of farmland and open spaces under a farmland and open space preservation program which is part of a State's comprehensive outdoor recreation plan. Limits payments to any State from such authorized amounts for a fiscal year to 33.3 percent of the total cost of acquiring such development rights. Directs the State to bear the remaining cost. Allows property acquired or developed under this Act to be converted to non-public outdoor recreation uses without the approval of the Secretary."
