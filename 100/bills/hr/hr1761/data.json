(Currently, States may provide such coverage for individuals whose income does not exceed the Federal poverty level.) Permits States which provide such Medicaid coverage to impose a Medicaid premium on Medicare beneficiaries whose income exceeds the Federal poverty level. Requires that such premium be set at either one-third of the Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) premium, or a percentage (not to exceed five percent) of the individual's income which exceeds the Federal proverty level, but never in excess of the value of the Medicaid assistance provided to such individual."
