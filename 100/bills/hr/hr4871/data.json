Specifies the jurisdictional bases for the offenses as the use of the U.S. mails, use of interstate or foreign communications, or use of or effect on interstate or foreign commerce. Imposes criminal penalties for endeavoring to deprive or defraud U.S. inhabitants of the honest services of a public official or person selected to be a public official. Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (RICO) and electronic surveillance statutes to add a reference to the public corruption offenses created by this Act."
