Amends the National Housing Act to limit the aggregate outstanding balance on promissory notes issued by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board should rely primarily on raising funds through the Financing Corporation to provide assistance through the FSLIC to resolve cases of failed or failing thrift institutions."
