Requires such rules and regulations to meet minimum Federal standards established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary: (1) within 90 days after enactment of this Act, to establish such standards; and (2) within 90 days after establishment of such standards, to review the laws and regulations of each State. Makes the Federal standards effective in any State which does not have in effect such laws and regulations by January 1, 1990."
