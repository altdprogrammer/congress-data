Excludes from the definition of a \"bank\" for purposes of such Act: (1) foreign banks (which would meet such definition solely because such bank has a branch in the United States); (2) insured thrift institutions; (3) organizations which do not do business in the United States except as an incident to activities outside the United States; (4) certain institutions that function solely in a trust or fiduciary capacity; (5) credit unions; (6) certain institutions which engage only in credit card operations; (7) Edge Act or Agreement corporations; (8) industrial loan companies; (9) the Investors Fiduciary Trust Company of Kansas City, Missouri; and (10) certain savings banks which are associated with the Great Western Financial Corporation.
