Directs the Secretary of the Defense Force, as part of the initial objectives of the Defense Force, to develop and produce prototypes of certain defense systems, including a space-based laser weapon system and a mobile, ground-based anti-missile system for intercepting ballistic reentry vehicles in the upper atmosphere. Sets timetables for such developments. Directs the Secretary to issue special rules to govern research, development, test, evaluation, production, procurement, and contracting necessary to carry out the Defense Force's mission.
