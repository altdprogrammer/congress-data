Permits grazing and right-of-ways in the Mojave National Park to the extent currently allowed. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate the feasibility of using the Kelso Depot and the existing railroad corridor for public access and facilities within the Mojave National Park. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands within the boundaries of such Park. Withdraws all Federal lands within these Parks from entry under the mining laws, subject to valid existing rights. Requires existing claims to be operated in a manner consistent with the protection of the scenic resources of the Parks. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: National Park Wilderness - Designates as wilderness the Death Valley National Park Wilderness, the Joshua Tree National Park Wilderness Additions, and the Mojave National Park Wilderness. Title III: Yosemite - Adds specified lands to Yosemite National Park, California. Prohibits expansion of any reservoir's capacity without prior congressional authorization. Title IV: Wild and Scenic River - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a section of the Kings River, California, as a component of the wild and scenic rivers system."
