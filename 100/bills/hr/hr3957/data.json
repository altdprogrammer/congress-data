Establishes the Delaware and Lehigh Navigation Canal National Heritage Corridor Commission to assist appropriate Federal, State, and local authorities in the development and implementation of an integrated resource management plan for the Corridor. Directs the Commission, within one year after it conducts its first meeting, to submit to the Secretary of the Interior a Cultural Heritage and Corridor Management Plan which: (1) provides an inventory of Corridor property to be preserved and restored because of its national historic or cultural significance; (2) develops a historic interpretive plan; and (3) recommends policies for resource management of the Corridor. Terminates the Commission in five years, with a possible five-year extension. Requires the Secretary to approve or disapprove the Commission's Plan within 60 days after its receipt. Directs the Secretary, following plan approval, to assist the Commission in producing interpretive materials. Requires any Federal entity conducting activities affecting Canal flows or Corridor natural resources to consult and cooperate with the Secretary and the Commission. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Commemoration of Statehood Anniversaries - Statehood Centennial Commemorative Coin Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue not more than a specified number of five dollar palladium coins in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the statehood of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Sets forth certain features of such coins and provides for their design, issuance, and sale. Terminates authority to mint coins under this Act after December 31, 1990. Requires a specified amount of all surcharges received from the sale of the coins to be provided to the \"Documents West\" exhibition program and administered by the Idaho Centennial Commission, to be used only for promoting the exhibition. Requires the Secretary to deposit in the Treasury all remaining surcharges received, to be used to reduce the national debt. Declares that: (1) no law governing procurement or public contracts shall be applicable to the procurement of goods and services for this Act, except laws relating to equal employment opportunity; and (2) no firm shall be considered a Federal contractor for purposes of specified Federal regulations as a result of participating as a U.S. Mint coin consignee. Requires U.S. coins to be redesigned, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, over the next six years. Requires the reverse side of the first coin redesigned to commemorate the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution for a two-year period. Requires that any profits from the sale of uncirculated and proof sets of U.S. coins be deposited in the Treasury and used solely to reduce the national debt."
