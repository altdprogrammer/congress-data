    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Arizona-Florida Land Exchange Act of 1988 - Title I - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of the real property used for the Phoenix Indian High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Ratifies the Agreement Among the United States, Collier Enterprises, Collier Development Corporation, and the Barron Collier Company under which the United States agrees to exchange such property for certain lands in Florida located in the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge owned by Collier and specified monetary proceeds. Requires the Secretary, if such Federal property is conveyed, to convey 20 acres of such property to the city of Phoenix to provide for public open space and recreation, to transfer jurisdiction and control of 11.5 acres of such property to the Veterans Administration (VA) for expansion of a VA hospital, and to transfer jurisidiction and control of 4.5 acres of such property to the VA for conveyance to, and use by, the State of Arizona as a site for a veterans home. Provides that such property conveyed to Phoenix and Arizona shall revert to the United States if not used for the prescribed purposes. Requires the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to: (1) cooperate with the city of Phoenix in the planning and development of the property conveyed to the VA for expansion of the VA hospital; and (2) transmit to specified congressional committees semiannually a report describing the VA's efforts in carrying out such cooperative planning. Directs the Administrator: (1) to convey the parcel of 4.5 acres, without reimbursement, to the State of Arizona when the Administrator has approved the State of Arizona's application for assistance in construction of a State veterans' facility on such parcel and the State has appropriated sufficient funds to pay for its portion of the costs of construction of such facility; and (2) to transfer jurisdiction and control of such parcel to the Secretary if the State does not submit such an application for assistance and appropriate such funds within three years after such parcel is transferred to the VA. Directs the Secretary to offer such property for sale to the city of Phoenix or another purchaser. Directs the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Administrator for the temporary use by the Administrator of the gymnasium constructed on the school property in 1975. Requires Collier to provide 135 days' advance notice of its intention to accept the offer of the United States under the exchange agreement to the Secretary, the Mayor of Phoenix, the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, the InterTribal Council of Arizona (ITCA), the governing body of the Navajo Tribe, and the Governor of Arizona. Prohibits Collier from providing such notice prior to the later of one year after the enactment of this Act or the submission of a specific plan for the Phoenix exchange property. Requires the Secretary, not later than 30 days after receiving such notice from Collier, to publish notice that the Secretary will consider offers by persons other than Collier for the school property. Requires any such offer to provide for: (1) a single cash payment of a minimum acceptable price; (2) an agreement to make annual payments into the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund or the Navajo Trust Fund; and (3) an offer to enter into a planning and development agreement with the city of Phoenix. Provides that: (1) if no qualifying offer is received, Collier may accept the U.S. offer under the exchange agreement; (2) if a qualifying offer is received, Collier will be allowed to match that offer; and (3) if Collier declines to match the best qualifying offer, the Secretary shall accept such offer. Provides for the management of school property which is not conveyed or which reverts to the United States under this Act. Requires the U.S. Comptroller General to report to the Congress and specified House and Senate committees on: (1) a specific plan as it relates to final zoning proposals of the Phoenix exchange property; and (2) the actions taken subsequent to the submission of such plan relative to the disposition of such property, the value received by the United States, and the process by which such value was determined. Provided for the deposit of the monetary proceeds from the school property into the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund and the Navajo Trust Fund.
