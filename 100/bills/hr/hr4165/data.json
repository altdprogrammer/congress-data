States that whoever operates a motor vehicle in such a jurisdiction consents to certain tests if arrested for driving under the influence of a drug or alcohol. States that such tests shall be administered upon the request of a police officer having reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested was driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. States that any person refusing to sumit to such tests, after having been advised of the consequences of such a refusal, shall be denied the privilege of operating a motor vehicle for one year."
