Establishes a direct reporting relationship between the Commissioner on Aging and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary). Requires the Administration on Aging to annually collect, and include in its annual report to the Congress and the President, data on: (1) expenditures for and utilization of services funded by this Act; (2) the number of senior centers supported by this Act; and (3) the extent to which area agencies on aging comply with certain requirements regarding the delivery of services.

Authorizes appropriations for State and community programs on aging for FY 1988 through 1991. Increases the percentage of funding for such programs that may be expended by areas agencies on aging for administrative purposes from 8.5 percent to ten percent. Requires area agencies on aging to: (1) operate as separate organizational units engaged only in the planning and provision of supportive or nutrition services in the service area; (2) hold periodic hearings on activities carried out under area plans; (3) provide opportunities for older individuals to volunteer to assist in the delivery of day care to children and adults, and respite care to families; and (4) coordinate in-home services, services providing access to old age services, and legal assistance provided under the Act with the activities of community-based organizations established for victims of Alzheimer's disease and their families.

Authorizes appropriations for the State long-term care ombudsman programs for FY 1988 through 1991. Requires that State long-term care ombudsman programs be carried out through an Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, with local ombudsman entities being designated as subdivisions of such Office.
