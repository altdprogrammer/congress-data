    "text": "Construction Labor Reform Act of 1987 - Amends the Davis-Bacon Act by increasing the contract coverage threshold to $100,000 (or $1,000,000 in the case of Department of Defense contracts). Provides that mechanics and laborers employed on contracts pursuant to such Act shall be paid no less often than twice a month (rather than once a week). Prohibits division of a project into smaller contracts to avoid Davis-Bacon Act coverage. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor, where such a division has occurred, to require: (1) retroactive incorporation of all the provisions which would have been required; and (2) compensation for payment to each affected laborer and mechanic of the difference in wage rates, with interest. Removes specified authority of the Comptroller General from such Act. Provides that, in accordance with specified regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor, wages found to be due laborers and mechanics under such Act shall be paid directly to them from accrued payments withheld under the contract. Provides that any sums due to laborers or mechanics under such Act and not paid because of inability to do so within three years, shall revert to or be deposited into the Treasury. Directs the Administrator of General Services to distribute a list to all departments of the Government giving the names of persons or firms that the Secretary of Labor has found to have disregarded their obligations to employees and subcontractors. Applies the $100,000 contract coverage threshold to federally assisted construction under related Acts requiring a Davis-Bacon wage determination. Amends the Copeland Act to require submission at least twice per month of a statement of compliance with labor standards provisions of applicable law, certifying the payroll of employees during the preceding period and coverage each week any contract work is performed. Makes specified provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, relating to the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents, applicable to the jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the Secretary of Labor."
