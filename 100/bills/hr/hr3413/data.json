Provides that all right, title, and interest in the property shall revert to the United States if: (1) the Museum at 3753 Broadway in New York City does not operate as a branch of the Museum to be established at the property; (2) the Museum does not continuously use such property solely as a North, South, and Central American Indian museum and maintain its historic architectural character; (3) the Museum does not maintain such property in a manner that ensures that adequate services are provided to the U.S. courts on the fifth and sixth floors; or (4) the Museum interferes with the occupancy of such property by the courts. Prohibits the Museum from using such property as security for any obligation. Reserves to the United States: (1) air and development rights associated with such property; and (2) the right to occupy the fifth and sixth floors of the property for use by U.S. courts until the Administrator provides suitable permanent accommodations for such courts at the Foley Square Courthouse Annex. Requires the Museum to submit a plan detailing any proposed renovation or alteration of the property to the Administrator, who shall approve such action unless it would not preserve the property's historic architectural character."
