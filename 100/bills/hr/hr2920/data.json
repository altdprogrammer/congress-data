Applies such provision to meat and meat products sold at wholesale and retail, including items subject to additional preparation after entering the United States. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for exemptions by regulations covering instances when compliance is impracticable. Authorizes the Secretary either to refuse to provide or to withdraw inspection service upon the determination, after opportunity for a hearing is given, that proper labeling has not been done. Requires the Secretary to withdraw inspection upon a third violation. Provides for judicial review by the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals of the Secretary's determinations and orders with respect to country of origin labeling."
