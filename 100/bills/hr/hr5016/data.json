    "text": "Defense Consultant Reform Act of 1988 - Requires any firm awarded a contract with the Department of Defense (DOD) to certify which consultants are to be used by such firm. Declares that failure to furnish such information may be the basis for cancellation of a contract with such firm. Prohibits the DOD from contracting with any consultant under circumstances that might make the contract award improper by reason of a conflict of interest or other considerations deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Defense. Defines \"covered consultant\" to mean any person who provides consulting services to a DOD contractor or who receives a contract to provide such services to DOD. Requires any covered consultant to register with the Secretary annually. Sets forth registration requirements. Directs the Secretary to suspend for at least three years any DOD contract with a covered consultant who fails to register or to provide accurate information. Provides that such consultant shall be fined no more than $100,000. Requires the Secretary, by April 1 of each year, to provide to the Congress a list of all persons providing consulting services to DOD, including services for any advisory committee relating to DOD."
