Directs the Secretary, prior to the beginning of 1994, to conduct a study of the economic impact of this Act and such alternative price support system. Continues such system beyond calendar year 1993 unless the Congress disapproves it, by joint resolution, prior to July 1, 1993. Sets the support level at 75 percent of the parity price if the Congress disapproves such system."
