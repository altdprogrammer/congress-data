    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase excise taxes as follows: (1) from 17 cents to 51 cents per gallon on wines containing not more than 14 percent alcohol; (2) from 67 cents to $2.01 per gallon on wines containing between 14 percent and 21 percent alcohol; and (3) from $9 to $27 per barrel on beer, with a reduced rate of $21 per barrel ($7 under current law) for certain domestic production. Imposes a floor stocks tax on wine and beer on which tax was imposed before the effective date of the increase and which is held on such date for sale by any person. Sets the amount of such inventory tax to equal the amount of the excise tax increase. Applies the floor stocks tax to certain goods held in foreign trade zones."
