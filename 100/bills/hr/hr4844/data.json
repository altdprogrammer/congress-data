    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #437 (413-1)) Subtitle A: Federal Aviation Administration Drug Enforcement Assistance - Federal Aviation Administration Drug Enforcement Assistance Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Federal Aviation Administrator to modify systems relating to aircraft registration, airman's certification, and fuel system alterations in order to make such systems more responsive to the needs of drug law enforcement authorities. Cites the areas to be modified. Requires the Administrator to issue final regulations implementing such modifications within ten months after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and collect user fees to cover the costs associated with such systems' modification. Prescribes user fee guidelines. Requires the Administrator to report annually to the Congress for a five-year period regarding the progress being made under this Act. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations under this Act. Cites conditions under which an aircraft used in connection with violations under this Act may be seized by or forfeited to drug law enforcement authorities. Requires the Administrator to report annually to the Congress for a three-year period on progress being made regarding: (1) informational assistance to drug law enforcement authorities; (2) registration and certification suspensions; and (3) the training of Federal Aviation Administration personnel with respect to controlled substances traffic. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on the funding resources needed on an annual basis to implement this Act during a five-year period. Requires that budget requests transmitted by the Administrator to the President or the Secretary of Transportation relating to implementation of this Act be concurrently submitted to certain congressional committees and officials. Requires the Office of Personnel Management to report to the Congress within 120 days after enactment of this Act regarding the results of its review of a certain position classification scheme. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress the results of a feasibility study relating to the cost/benefit ratio (with respect to drug interdiction) of requiring aircraft entering the continental United States to: (1) have an operating transponder installed; and (2) have a flight plan filed with the Federal Aviation Administration before such entry. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress the results of a feasibility study pertaining to: (1) the interception of aircraft deviating from established flight corridors across the borders of the continental United States; and (2) the impact of the establishment of such corridors on safe and efficient aircraft movement and upon drug interdiction. Modifies the guidelines for revoked airmen's certificates to prohibit certification to any person whose certificate has been revoked (current law limits such proscription to five years). Permits the Administrator to issue such a certificate to a person whose certificate has been revoked if to do so will facilitate law enforcement efforts. Authorizes waiver of statutory revocation requirements upon the request of Federal or State law enforcement officials if the Administrator determines that such waiver will facilitate law enforcement efforts. Declares that this Act applies only to aircraft which are not used to provide specified air transportation. Subtitle B: Drug Recognition Expert Regional Training Program - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a regional program for training law enforcement officers to recognize and identify motor vehicle operators under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1989 through 1993. Subtitle C: Alcohol and Drug Traffic Safety - Alcohol and Drug Traffic Safety Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary to make basic and supplemental grants to States which adopt and implement drunk driving enforcement programs. Sets forth guidelines for such grants and authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Directs the Secretary to publish final regulations for program implementation in the Federal Register and to transmit them to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to transmit to the Congress within one year after enactment of this Act the results of a study by the National Academy of Sciences regarding which blood alcohol concentration levels impair the efficiency of motor vehicle operators. Requires such study to establish standards for determining impairment by a controlled substance or any other drug. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989."
