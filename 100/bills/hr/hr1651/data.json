Requires the President to negotiate with the priority foreign countries to establish adequate and effective protection for U.S. persons' rights. Directs the President to take action, such as terminating, withdrawing, or suspending any portion of a trade agreement or duty-free treatment, if unable to reach an agreement on such issues. Authorizes the President to defer such actions upon certifying to the Congress that negotiations are making substantial progress. Requires the President to consult with the Register of Copyrights, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, and interested congressional Members and committees and to keep them informed of priorities, progress, and possible U.S. concessions."
