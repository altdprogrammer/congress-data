Specifies that such Illegal Drug Coordinator shall be an official appointed by the President who, at the time of appointment, holds an office which required confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Directs the Coordinator to transfer such funds to various Government agencies and activities to more effectively fight the war against the production, distribution, and use of illegal drugs, for treatment of addicts, or to cooperate with international agencies for such purposes. Increases personnel ceilings for each agency to the extent necessary to fulfill this Act's purposes. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to finance long-term or permanent facilities and equipment not primarily used for the war against drugs, other than for an interagency data system. Specifies some of the departments, agencies, and activities to which sums may be transferred. Declares that the war against illegal drugs constitutes a dire emergency. Directs that sums provided under this Act shall not be considered to be within the funding ceiling for a given function or section under any budgetary rule, resolution, or agreement heretofore adopted."
