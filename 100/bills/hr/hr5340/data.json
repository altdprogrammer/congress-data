    "text": "Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act - Provides for the partition of the joint Hoopa Valley and Yurok Reservation. Requires the Hoopa Valley Tribe to waive all claims against the United States before the partition shall become effective. Establishes the Hoopa Valley and Yurok Reservations. Requires the unallotted trust lands and assets of each tribe to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the respective tribes. Sets the boundary between the Hoopa Valley and Yurok Reservations. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the unallotted trust land and assets of the Yurok Reservation until the tribe has organized. Requires, thereafter, that such land and assets be administered as tribal trust land and governed by the Tribe. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands or interests in lands, including rights-of-way for access to trust lands in the Reservation. Establishes the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Fund for distributions pursuant to this Act. Divides fund assets between the tribes based on settlement roll calculations. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund. Prescribes preparation and eligibility criteria for the Hoopa-Yurok settlement roll. Allows an election among the following settlement options: (1) Hoopa tribal membership option (based on the criteria of the court decision in the Short case); (2) Yurok tribal membership option; and (3) lump sum payment option. Extinguishes interest in tribal property of persons receiving payments. Provides for division of the remaining settlement funds. Ratifies the existing documents of the Hoopa Valley Tribe and confirms its status. Provides for recognition and organization of the Yurok Tribe. Establishes an Interim Council preceding election and installation of the tribal governing body. Allows the land assignment on the Hoopa Valley Reservation made to the Smokers family to continue to relatives of one-fourth or more Indian blood. Provides for a merger of the Rancherias with the Yurok Tribe if certain conditions are met. Provides that the proceeds of the sale of timber from Indian trust lands, after deduction for administrative expenses, shall be used: (1) as determined by the governing bodies of the tribes concerned and approved by the Secretary; or (2) in the absence of such a governing body, as determined by the Secretary for the tribe concerned."
