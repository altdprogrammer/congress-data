    "text": "Military Air Traffic Controller Employment Flexibility Act - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to consider employing air traffic controllers under the administrative authority of the Secretary of Defense when selecting applicants for air traffic controller positions (without regard to whether or not such controllers participated in a specified air traffic controller's strike.). Sets forth guidelines for making such decisions, and for employment probation, seniority, and back pay. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such appointments should not: (1) cause the separation or reduction in grade of any other air traffic controller; or (2) interfere with training opportunities open to air traffic controllers seeking to become fully qualified."
