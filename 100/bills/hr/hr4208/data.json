Authorizes a 30-day extension of such deadline if the Secretary determines that additional time is needed for analysis or response to public comments. Requires that a determination not to proceed with a designation be made in writing and submitted to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Directs the Secretary to publish a designation notice (or findings regarding why such notice has not been published) within 30 months after publication of a notice declaring a site to be an active candidate for sanctuary designation. Requires the Secretary to take the action necessary to promote and coordinate the use of national marine sanctuaries for research. Authorizes the Secretary to issue special use permits for the conduct of specified activities in a national marine sanctuary if it is necessary to condition access to and use of, or promote public use and understanding of a sanctuary resource. Requires that such permits: (1) authorize only those activities which are compatible with the purposes for which the sanctuary is designated, and sanctuary resource protection; (2) last for no more than five years, unless renewed; and (3) require permittees to purchase and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance against claims arising out of permitted activities and agree to hold the Federal Government harmless against such claims. Authorizes the imposition of permit fees which, after recovering permit issuance costs and costs incurred by the Secretary as the direct result of permitted activities, provide the Federal Government with a reasonable return. Authorizes the use of collected fees for the permit program, and for designating and managing sanctuaries. Imposes penalties for the violation of permit provisions. Directs each permittee to submit an annual report to the Secretary which described activities conducted pursuant to such permit and revenues derived from such activities during the year. Excludes fishing from this Act's permit process. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to specified congressional committees on the implementation of the permit process. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with nonprofit organizations to aid and promote interpretive, historical, scientific, and educational activities, and solicit private donations for such activities. Subjects anyone who destroys, causes the loss of, or injures any sanctuary resource to liability to the Federal Government for response costs and damages resulting from such destruction, loss, or injury. Subjects vessels to liability in rem for such costs or damages. Sets forth defenses to such liability. Directs the Secretary to pursue civil actions against persons or vessels who may be liable for such costs or damages.
