Establishes in the Treasury the National Organ Transplant Assistance Trust Fund and appropriates to it amounts equal to those designated on tax returns. Establishes a program through which Trust Fund monies will be used to finance grants to health care facilities where organ transplants are performed to assist the facilities in performing transplants for individuals unable to afford them. Sets forth general criteria to govern these grants."
