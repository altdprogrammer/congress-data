    "text": "Africa Famine Recovery and Development Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to add a chapter dealing with Africa Famine Recovery and Development. Authorizes the President to provide project and program assistance for long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa. Requires the purpose of such assistance to be to help the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa to participate in a process of long-term development through economic growth that is equitable, participatory, environmentally sustainable, and self-reliant. Declares that the general authorities and policies of the development assistance provisions of such Act apply to this Act. Requires the agency primarily responsible for administering development assistance programs (responsible agency) to: (1) take into account the local-level perspective of the rural and urban poor in sub-Saharan Africa during the planning and review of annual country planning documents for project assistance under this Act; (2) make available funds for a substantial expansion of development efforts by private and voluntary organizations which have demonstrated effectiveness in or commitment to the promotion of local grass-roots activities on behalf of long-term development in sub-Saharan Africa; (3) establish simplified procedures for the development and evaluation of projects to be carried out by private and voluntary organizations; and (4) consult with other organizations in order to identify relevant private and voluntary organizations. Requires the close consultation and involvement of local people in projects that have a local focus. Requires the responsible agency to ensure the participation of African women in development projects assisted by this Act. Requires the responsible agency to use the program assistance provided by this Act to: (1) help overcome shorter-term constraints to long-term development; and (2) promote reform of national economic policies to support these priorities. Sets forth examples of national economic policy reforms which can be supported by assistance provided by this Act. Requires such reforms to include provisions to protect vulnerable groups, especially poor farmers and the urban poor, from possible negative consequences of such reforms. Requires assistance for such reforms to take account of the need for adjustments should recurrence of drought make it impossible to achieve the goals of the reforms. Designates as the critical sectoral priorities for long-term development: (1) increased agricultural production and the maintenance and restoration of renewable natural resources; (2) improved health conditions; (3) voluntary family planning services; (4) improved relevance and efficiency of education; and (5) development of income generating opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed. Imposes minimum levels of assistance for certain critical sectors. Requires the responsible agency to formulate coherent country development assistance strategies. Sets forth information such strategies must analyze and address. Requires the assistance provided under this Act to be concentrated in countries that will make the most effective use of such assistance. Exempts the assistance authorized by this Act from specified limitations on the procurement of goods and services. Specifies uses for local currencies generated by assistance provided under this Act and other Acts. Provides that funds made available under this Act may be used to assist the countries in sub-Saharan Africa to increase their capacity to participate in donor coordination mechanisms at the country, regional, and sector levels. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992 for long-term development assistance for sub-Saharan Africa and for funding activities of certain international organizations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the authorization should be extended whenever appropriate. Limits transfers between accounts funded by this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID) to develop a plan for organizational changes within AID in order to carry out the long-term development assistance program for sub-Saharan Africa with maximum effectiveness. Sets forth changes the Administrator shall consider. Requires the Administrator to consult with specified congressional committees about such changes. Authorizes the Administrator to transfer certain funds in order to increase the AID resources for development assistance activities for sub-Saharan Africa. Requires the Administrator to develop a plan for evaluating AID's progress in achieving the purposes of this Act. Requires the plan to provide for: (1) interim evaluations; (2) the establishment of specific criteria for measuring the performance of U.S. development assistance for the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa; (3) the collection and monitoring of base-line data for future measurement of the effectiveness of such assistance; and (4) the measures by which the evaluations will be used to institutionalize learning within AID. Requires the plan to be developed in consultation with specified congressional committees. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Office of Technology Assessment should: (1) conduct independent evaluations of AID's performance in providing development assistance to the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa; and (2) report on such evaluations to specified congressional committees. Requires that assistance from other assistance and development programs be used to provide assistance to the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Authorizes the President to make available such amounts from the funds authorized by this Act as the President deems appropriate to support long-term development assistance for activities of international organizations which are consistent with the purpose of providing assistance for the poor majority in sub-Saharan Africa and which are undertaken in coordination with AID. Encourages the President to use the authorities provided in this Act in coordination with activities of the multilateral development banks in sub-Saharan Africa. Entitles any country in sub-Saharan Africa to debt rescheduling if: (1) that country had an average per capita income in 1984 of less that $550; and (2) at any time between October 1, 1987, and September 30, 1992, an International Monetary Fund standby agreement is in effect with respect to that country, an economic adjustment program of the International Bank for Reconstructionn and Development is in effect with respect to that country, or the President makes a specified certification to the Congress regarding economic policy reforms in such country. Provides that the debt rescheduling shall consist of a five-year grace period on all payments to the United States on specified types of loans. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of the International Monetary Fund and of the relevant multilateral development banks to pursue means by which those institutions could reschedule the payments due them by the low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Requires the President to ensure that the funds made available by this Act are not used by a country to repay loans. Requires the annual report by the President to the Congress on foreign assistance programs to include a report on the progress made in carrying out this Act. Provides that reprogramming notification requirements do not apply to funds used to carry out this Act. Makes conforming amendments to various Acts. Declares that, where appropriate, African famine relief activities should serve as the foundation for long-term development activities undertaken pursuant to this Act. Provides for the transfer of certain funds so that they may be used for management support activities associated with long-term development assistance. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the purposes of the African Development Foundation are consistent with the purposes of this Act. Amends the African Development Foundation Act to authorize appropriations for the African Development Foundation for FY 1988. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Office of Technology Assessment should conduct an independent evaluation of the performance of the African Development Foundation in carrying out its purposes and in assuring the sustainability and replicability of the development efforts which the Foundation supports. Expresses the sense of the Congress that special efforts should be undertaken to reduce trade barriers and promote economic interchange between the United States and developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
