Sets the permit term at a renewable five years and authorizes EPA to collect administrative costs from a vessel owner/operator. Title II: Waste Tracking System - Requires that a manifest be completed for municipal or commercial wastes transported by vessel and a copy returned to the EPA regional office. Title III: Waste Handling Practices - Requires that owners/operators of waste source facilities make sure that waste material is properly loaded, secured, and offloaded. Title IV: Enforcement - Requires other Federal agencies to assist in the administration of this Act. Establishes civil penalties for violations, authorizing doubling for second violations. Authorizes the Administrator of EPA to revoke vessel identification numbers for egregious or multiple violations. Establishes criminal penalties for the willful and knowing violation of this Act. Title V: EPA Responsibilities - Requires the Administrator to make manifest and vessel identification number forms available and to establish a recordkeeping system for such applications. Title VI: Tracking Study - Directs the Administrator to study the effectiveness of additional tracking systems for vessels to ensure that nonhazardous municipal and commercial waste is not disposed of at sea or in coastal waters. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to study the effectiveness and costs of tracking systems that might be applicable to vessels carrying nonhazardous municipal or commercial waste. Title VII: Coast Guard Responsibilities - Directs the Secretary to make periodic checks for vessel permits and compliance with the applicable Federal environmental laws, including the installation of tracking devices if required. Title VIII: Relation to Other Laws - States that other Federal and State laws remain unaffected by this Act. Title IX: Authorization - Authorizes appropriations. Title X: Savings Clause - Authorizes actions by other than Federal entities for violations of this Act."
