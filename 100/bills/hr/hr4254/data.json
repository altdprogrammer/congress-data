Russell Lake (once known as the Trotter's Shoals Project). Modifies the J. Strom Thurmond Dam and Reservoir project (once known as the Clarks Hill Lake and Dam) to authorize water conservation as a project purpose. Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to establish, revise, and develop for each of the water conservation projects a drought management plan to cover the project in times of low rainfall. Requires a final report on each plan by April 1, 1989. Expresses the sense of the Congress that a citizen's advisory council should be established for each of the water conservation projects to advise the appropriate district of the Corps of Engineers on its management of such projects."
