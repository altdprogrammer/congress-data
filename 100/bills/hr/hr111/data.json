Revises the individual income tax to impose a ten percent tax on the earned income of an individual in excess of a $10,000 exemption amount. Provides for annual cost-of-living adjustments to such exemption amount. Defines \"earned income\" as: (1) wages, salaries, and other employee compensation; (2) the amount of net earnings from self-employment; and (3) the amount of dividends from a personal service corporation or which are otherwise directly or indirectly compensation for services. Exempts from earned income: (1) any amount received as a pension or annuity; and (2) tips. Provides for a general amnesty for any tax (or for penalties and interest with respect to such tax) for any taxable year ending on or before January 6, 1987. Repeals all specific exclusions from gross income, all deductions, and all income tax credits to the extent related to the computation of individual income tax liability. Repeals the estate and gift taxes."
