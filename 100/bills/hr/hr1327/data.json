    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #314 (387-9)) National Health Service Corps Amendments Act of 1987 - Title I: National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program and Loan Repayment Program - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, under which the U.S. Government, in exchange for at least two years of Corps service in a health manpower shortage area, will repay student loans related to the medical professional education of eligible health care personnel. Sets forth eligibility requirements for participation in the loan repayment program. Directs the Secretary to provide to applicants specified information concerning the rights and liabilities of an individual whose application is approved. Requires the Secretary to give priority to the applications of individuals whose training is in a health care specialty needed by the Corps. Lists provisions that must be incorporated in the written contract between the Secretary and a successful applicant. Describes the scope of repayments available under the program, including government and commercial loans received by the individual for tuition expenses, all other reasonable educational expenses, or reasonable living expenses as determined by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to make loan repayments to a maximum of $20,000 for each year the recipient individual contracts to serve in the Corps. Sets the maximum at $25,000 for each year the individual contracts to serve in the Indian Health Service. Requires the Secretary, by March 1 of each year, to submit to the Congress a report containing specified data relating to the loan repayment program. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for the establishment of State programs similar to the Loan Repayment Program under provisions of this Act. Requires State programs to: (1) provide for repayment of loans; (2) establish minimum standards for the designation of areas in which individuals will perform obligated service, or provide for the use of areas designated by the Secretary; and (3) establish minimum standards for the determination of obligated service. Prohibits the Federal share of any such State program from exceeding 75 percent. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Requires the Secretary to report annually on January 20 to specified congressional committees certain data relating to the personnel needs of the Corps and the means proposed for filling them. Authorizes appropriations for such scholarships and loan repayments. Directs the Secretary, in assigning members of the Corps to health manpower shortage areas, to give priority to meeting the needs of the Indian Health Service and the needs of health programs or facilities operated by tribes or tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination Act. Requires damages for breach of service obligation contracts to be paid within one year of the breach. Directs the Secretary, if damages are delinquent for three months, to use collection agencies or, if collection agencies are unavailable, to enter into contracts for the recovery of the damages. Directs the Secretary, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by law, to disclose to credit reporting agencies information relating to damages of more than $100 that are entitled to be recovered and that are delinquent by more than 31 days. Establishes a formula for determining the amount of damages that the United States will be entitled to recover in the event of breach of contract by the individual loan payment grantee. Allows individuals who have breached their contract by failing to begin or complete their service obligation to contract with the Secretary to serve out their period of obligation at a site which: (1) is on either the Health Manpower Shortage Area Placement Opportunity List or on the Supplemental Health Manpower Shortage Area Placement Opportunity List; and (2) meets other stated criteria. Describes sites which the Secretary is required or allowed to include on the supplemental list. Authorizes the Secretary to assign individuals who have not breached their contract to such sites in certain circumstances. Title II: Revisions and Extensions of General Program for the National Health Service Corps - Sets forth procedures to be followed and data to be considered by the Secretary before removing certain areas from those designated as having a health manpower shortage. Adds ability to pay for health services to the criteria indicative of need for the purpose of designating health manpower shortage areas. Revises provisions relating to: (1) the private practice service option of the Corps; and (2) deadlines applicable to the Secretary when providing notice to certain individuals concerning obligated service in the Corps. Retains the $25,000 loan for such purposes and states that the interest rate on such loans shall not exceed five percent per year. Changes the program under which former Corps members may receive special loans to enter full-time clinical private practice in a health manpower shortage area by eliminating the option whereby an individual could engage in such practice for only one year in exchange for a loan of $12,500. Authorizes appropriations to the National Health Service Corps program for FY 1988 through 1990. Directs the Secretary, in determining the priority for the placement of members of the Corps under specified provisions in medically underserved areas, to consider: (1) whether the areas are served by at least one health professional and the effectiveness of non-Federal programs in recruiting health professionals for the areas; (2) the geographic isolation of the areas; and (3) the economic need of the populations of the areas and the association of the areas with a high infant mortality rate."
