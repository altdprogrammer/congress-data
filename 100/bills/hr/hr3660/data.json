Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make grants to applicant Indian tribes or tribal organizations for programs and activities under this title for the benefit of Indian children. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether to approve a tribal grant application, to consider: (1) the tribe's codes, regulations, and cultural factors, as well as applicable State licensing and regulatory requirements, in establishing standards for such programs; and (2) the availability of child care services provided by the State in accordance with this title. Requires coordination between tribal and State programs under this title. Includes among lead agency duties the establishment of several local advisory councils that collectively represent the entire geographical area in the State.

Requires the plan to specify that at least 75 percent of the State allotment will be used to provide qualified child care services to eligible children, on a sliding fee scale basis (according to specified funding methods) with priority given to services to children of families with very low incomes for their size. Requires that at least ten percent of such reserved funds be used to provide for the extension of part-day programs. Requires the plan to use not more than 15 percent of the State allotment for all of the following child care related activities: (1) financial assistance for State and local resource and referral programs; (2) improvement of compliance monitoring and enforcement of State licensing, registration, and other regulations; (3) training, technical assistance, and scholarship assistance; (4) adequate salaries and compensation for full- and part-time staff who provide child care services for which assistance is provided under this title; (5) grants and low-interest loans to family and nonprofit providers to establish programs and renovate and improve existing facilities; and (6) grants and low-interest loans to providers to meet government child care standards, with priority to those receiving Federal or other publicly-assisted child care programs serving families with very low incomes.

Allows a State to issue such certificates only if a resource and referral program by a organization recognized under specified providions is available to help parents locate child care services made available by eligible child care providers. Requires that a specified portion of State allotment funds be used to enable providers to extend the hours of operation of part-day programs to provide full-working-day child care services throughout the year. Prohibits financial assistance under this title from being expended for the construction of a new facility, and sets forth limitations on such assistance for renovation or repair of existing facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to make planning grants, in the first year of their program participation, to States which desire to participate under this title but cannot fully satisy the requirements of a State plan without financial assistance. Provides for a review of the operation of a State plan during the five-year period to determine the State's continued eligibility for funds. Directs the Governors of each participating State to establish, and appoint members of, a State advisory committee on child care to assist the lead agency, review and evaluate services, make recommendations on standards and practices, and perform other functions to improve the quantity and quality of child care services. Requires the committee to have a subcommittee on licensing to review the laws applicable to end the licensing requirements and policies of each licensing agency regulating child care services and programs in the State (unless the State has done such a review during the four years before the establishment of the committee). Requires the subcommittee to report to the Governor, within one year after the committee's establishment, on specified matters. Requires the Governor, within 60 days of receipt of such report, to report to the Secretary with comments and a plan for correcting or improving licensing, regulating, and monitoring of child care services and programs. Terminates assistance under this title for committee activities occurring more than 90 days after the State report is submitted. Requires States receiving funds under this title to recognize private nonprofit community-based organizations, public organizations, local governments, or public agencies representing combinations of local governments, as resource and referral agencies for particular areas designated by lead agencies, and to provide assistance to such resource and referral agencies.

Directs the State to provide outreach to businesses and encourage them to contribute to the cost of such activities. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement that three percent of its allotment be used for such activities, if: (1) the State demonstrates that such expenditure would not be substantially effective to expand the availability of child care services; and (2) such reserved amount will be expended for other specified child care services and activities. Establishes in the Department of Health and Human Services the position of Administrator of Child Care, to be appointed by the Secretary. Requires the Administrator to: (1) coordinate all of such Department's activities relating to child care, and to coordinate them with similar activities of other Federal entities; (2) annually collect and publish State child care standards, including periodic modifications; (3) evaluate activities funded under this title; (4) act as a clearinghouse for specified matters, including studies on salaries of child care workers; and (5) provide technical assistance to States to carry out this title. Establishes enforcement provisions for review of State plans and monitoring of State compliance. Sets forth provisions for payments to States of the Federal share of the aggregate amount to be expended under the State plan. Sets such Federal share at 80 percent, but raises it to 85 percent when the State demonstrates that all child care providers are appropriately licensed and regulated and that those receiving assistance meet certain requirements and minimum standards under this title. Requires the Secretary to establish a National Advisory Committee on Child Care Standards to: (1) review Federal policies on child care services and such other data as appropriate; (2) submit to the Secretary proposed minimum standards for child care programs; and (3) develop and make available to lead agencies model regulations for resource and referral agencies. Limits the areas of concern which such proposed minimum child care standards may address. Limits such standards for center-based child care services to: (1) group size limits in terms of number of caregivers and number and ages of children; (2) maximum appropriate child-staff ratios; (3) personnel qualifications and background; (4) health, nutrition, and safety; and (5) parental involvement in licensed and regulated services.
