    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Optional Acreage Diversion Act of 1987 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide that a 1988 wheat or feed grain crop producer who devotes any amount in excess of 50 percent of permitted wheat acreage to conservation use shall receive deficiency payments at a bushel-rate established by the Secretary of Agriculture. (Current law provides for a 50 percent planting option). States that such payment rate: (1) shall be not less than the projected deficiency payment rate; and (2) shall be made public prior to the program sign-up period. Limits 1988 haying and grazing to not more than 50 percent of each of a farm's permitted wheat and feed grain acreages. Requires the Secretary to issue implementing regulations within 30 days of enactment of this Act which shall include provisions ensuring that: (1) farm acreage bases and payment yields shall not be reduced if producers set aside such additional acreage; and (2) to the extent practicable such program shall not adversely affect landlord-tenant acreage base relationships. Requires the Secretary to implement the provisions of this Act in a manner that will minimize any adverse impact on agribusiness and other agriculturally-related economic interests within any county, State, or region."
