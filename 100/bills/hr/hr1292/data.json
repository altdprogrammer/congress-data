    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to: (1) prohibit the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a license to any person with demonstrated poor character; and (2) require the Commission to revoke the license of any licensee with demonstrated poor character. Describes the acts which are considered evidence of poor character, including persistent failure to give priority to safety concerns. Requires the Commission to hold a hearing on the record upon a prima facie showing that an applicant or licensee has committed such an act. Authorizes the Commission to revoke (or refuse to grant) a license if the Commission determines that such an act has been committed. Confers jurisdiction upon certain Federal district courts to review such Commission decisions."
