    "text": "Agriculture in Transition Act - Amends title III (Employment and Training Programs for Dislocated Workers) of the Job Training Partnership Act to provide for grants to States and service delivery areas for dislocated farmers and ranchers. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in determining whether to award such a grant to a State or to one or more service delivery areas within a State, to consider: (1) the need to make services available throughout the State; (2) the desirability of providing a comprehensive set of services to eligible individuals at a single site; and (3) the extent to which administrative overhead can be reduced and duplication avoided. Allows grant recipients to subcontract for the delivery of services. Requires programs assisted through such grants to provide services to individuals: (1) who can certify or demonstrate that the farm or ranch operations which provide their primary occupation have terminated or will terminate because of specified circumstances; (2) who may reasonably be expected to leave farming or ranching as their primary occupation because of unfavorable debt-to-asset ratio; or (3) displaced from agriculture-related businesses and industries whose companies have been adversely affected by the declining agricultural economy. Requires programs assisted through such grants to provide to individuals and their immediate families who are attempting to continue farming or ranching: (1) assistance in evaluating their financial condition and preparing financial plans; and (2) assistance in managing temporary crises. Requires programs assisted by such grants to provide to individuals and their immediate families who are not attempting to continue farming or ranching or employment in an agriculture-related business or industry: (1) vocational evaluation; (2) basic skills, remedial, and literary education; (3) job search assistance; (4) entrepreneurial training; (5) classroom, occupational skills, and on-the-job training; and (6) supportive services. Allows grant funds to also be used to: (1) develop jobs with local employers; (2) provide funds for education training expenses; and (3) reimburse employers for up to one-half the wages paid during on-the-job training. Sets forth grant application requirements. Directs the Governor of each State receiving such grant funds to establish and provide administrative support to a rural employment opportunities task force to advise the Governor on dislocated worker programs and to report annually to the Secretary on the effectiveness of such programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992 for grants to States for dislocated farmers and ranchers."
