Provides that such assistance may be provided only if: (1) the dwelling that secures the primary loan is the current residence of the veteran; (2) the veteran is at least six months delinquent in payments on the primary loan; (3) the veteran is unemployed or has had a substantial reduction in household income through no fault of the veteran; and (4) the Administrator determines that there is a reasonable prospect that the veteran will resume payment on the primary loan within six months after receiving such assistance."
