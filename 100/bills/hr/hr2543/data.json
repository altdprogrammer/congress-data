Makes subject to seizure and forfeiture any vessel which violates such prohibition. Requires the President to withhold from foreign assistance funds allocated to a country an amount equal to the value of Cuban sugar imported by that country. Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to initiate negotiations with U.S. trading partners with regard to the elimination or restriction of trade with all those foreign countries: (1) the governments of which are not recognized by the United States; (2) which do not have diplomatic relations with the United States; or (3) which are terrorist nations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that income from sources within certain countries shall not be eligible for the tax exclusion allowed for foreign earned income. Specifies such countries as: (1) those with which the United States does not have diplomatic relations; or (2) those which, as determined by the Secretary of State, engage in or support international terrorism. Prohibits imports from Angola and exports to Angola for the benefit of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. Ends such restrictions if the President makes specified determinations including a determination that all troops from Cuba, the Soviet Union, and any other Communist country have withdrawn from Angola. Directs the President to prescribe regulations requiring the accelerated repayment of all U.S. loans by any country determined to be extending new loans to Cuba on a subsidized basis."
