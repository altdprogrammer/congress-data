Establishes an agricultural surplus Export Reserve for such program. Permits such Reserve to be used for barter for strategic and other stockpiled materials, either for direct ownership or for storage use as collateral. Sets forth policy guidelines for such Reserve, including a prohibition on its use to expand exports to any nation with which the United States does not have full diplomatic relations or against which the President has imposed a trade embargo. Establishes the Export Reserve Advisory Council to advise the Secretary and the Trade Representative on how best to use such Reserve. Requires semi-annual reports to the appropriate congressional committees."
