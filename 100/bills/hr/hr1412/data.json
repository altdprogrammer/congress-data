    "text": "Worker Adjustment Improvement Act of 1987 - Title I: Financing Through the Imposition of Small Uniform Duty on All Imports - Directs the President to undertake negotiations to change the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to allow countries to impose a uniform duty on all imports in order to use the revenue from such duty to fund trade adjustment assistance programs. Directs the President to report to the Congress six months after enactment of this Act on the progress of such negotiations. Directs the President to report to the Congress as soon as the GATT allows the imposition of such a duty. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to impose an additional duty on all imports into the United States having a value of at least $1,000, including those imports granted duty-free treatment, with specified exceptions. Title II: Unemployment Compensation for Dislocated Workers - Unemployment Compensation for Dislocated Workers Act - Allows States to enter into agreements with the Secretary of Labor under which the State agency will make payments of Federal unemployment compensation for dislocated workers to individuals who are participating in a job training program for dislocated workers under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act. Requires such individuals to have exhausted all rights to unemployment compensation under State, Federal, or Canadian law. Limits such payments to a maximum period of ten weeks of unemployment which begin in the individual's period of eligibility. Prohibits such payments to any individual for any week of unemployment which begins more than two years after the end of the benefit year for which the individual exhausted rights to regular compensation. Requires that such Federal-State agreements provide that the State establish a Federal unemployment compensation for dislocated workers account for a benefit year for each individual who files an application for such compensation. Provides that the amount in such account shall be equal to ten times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. Provides that each State which has entered into such an agreement shall be paid an amount equal to 100 percent of the Federal unemployment compensation for dislocated workers paid to individuals by the State pursuant to such agreement. Provides that funds in the extended unemployment compensation account of the Unemployment Trust Fund shall be used for making such payments to States, through transfers of such funds to the State account in the Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the extended unemployment compensation account to carry out the purposes of this title. Authorizes appropriations to the general fund of the Treasury to assist States in meeting the costs of administration of agreements under this title. Sets forth provisions relating to fraud and overpayments under this title. Title III: Strengthening the Dislocated Workers Program - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (the Act) to require each State to include any termination or layoff which involves 100 or more employees in any place of employment in the identification of dislocated workers under title III (Employment and Training Assistance for Dislocated Workers) of the Act. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish in the Department of Labor a Federal Dislocated Workers Unit to: (1) receive State annual plans for providing title III services; (2) receive specified reports; (3) establish performance guidelines for State title III programs and report annually to the Congress on State performance; and (4) provide technical assistance to the States and to local service providers. Directs the Secretary to: (1) enter into an agreement with the National Commission for Employment Policy to conduct research and evaluation of methods for effective worker adjustment; and (2) report annually to the Congress on the findings resulting from such agreement. Requires States to submit to the Secretary their plans of title III activities for the succeeding fiscal year. Requires States to reserve specified title III funds to establish and operate a State dislocated workers unit to: (1) respond to large-scale layoffs and terminations, especially those resulting from the permanent closure of a plant or facility; (2) establish and operate an information gathering and notification system for notification by employers of such closures; (3) provide appropriate information and assistance to both employers and employees subject to such a closure; and (4) facilitate services to dislocated workers affected by such a closure. Requires such State units to coordinate their activities with the State job coordinating council and with the appropriate regional office of the Department of Labor. Requires States to reserve specified title III funds for basic skills education programs for dislocated workers. Authorizes State dislocated workers units to establish joint labor-management training programs. Sets forth application requirements for grants to labor-management committees. Sets forth authorized uses of such funds. Adds State reporting requirements under title III of the Act. Directs the Secretary to furnish technical assistance upon State request. Directs the Secretary, within six months after enactment of this Act, to commence a study of methods of implementing portability for pensions and health benefits for dislocated workers, including an evaluation of the provision of early retirement benefits without penalty for older dislocated workers. Requires a report on such study to be submitted to the Congress within 18 months after enactment of this Act."
