(Present law requires seizure information to be transmitted only to the U.S. attorney's office in the district at which the seizure took place.) Requires forfeiture proceedings for obscene material to begin within 30 days of seizure. Prohibits invalidation of a seizure or forfeiture for delay if proceedings are postponed pending the consideration of constitutional issues. Permits stays of forfeiture proceedings pending completion of any related criminal matters."
