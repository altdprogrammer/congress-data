    "text": "AIDS Public Education Act of 1988 - Amends title III (General Powers and Duties of Public Health Service) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities to assist the grantees in: (1) collecting and disseminating information regarding the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); (2) educating individuals regarding such information; and (3) encouraging individuals to determine the extent to which their financial resources, including health insurance, are adequate for payment of the costs of medical treatment for infection with such etiologic agent. Requires the Secretary, in making the grants, to give preference to applicants with experience in educating the public, including the business community, on health matters. Allows grantees to expend the grant to train individuals. Requires applicants to agree to expend not less than 75 percent of the grant to carry out the purposes of the grant in an employment setting. Requires the Secretary to evaluate the grant programs and to make the findings available to the public. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991."
