    "text": "Coast Guard Environmental Compliance Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out a program of environmental compliance and restoration at Coast Guard facilities, including identification, investigation, and cleanup of contamination, correction of other environmental damage, and demolition and removal of unsafe buildings and structures. Directs the Secretary to take action with respect to sites formerly, as well as sites currently, under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, subject to exception, to pay fees and charges imposed by State authorities for permit services for the disposal of hazardous substances to the same extent that nongovernmental entities are required to pay. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with any Federal, State, or local government agency for services regarding off-site contamination. Makes the provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) relating to response action contractors apply to contractors who carry out response actions under these provisions. Establishes in the Coast Guard the Coast Guard Environmental Compliance Account, to consist of: (1) all sums appropriated to carry out the Secretary's environmental compliance under these or any other provisions of law; and (2) amounts recovered under specified provisions of CERCLA. Requires an annual report to the Congress describing the progress made in implementing this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
