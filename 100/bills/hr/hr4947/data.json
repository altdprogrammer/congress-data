Sets forth exceptions, including disclosure: (1) to that individual; (2) with that individual's consent; (3) to a law enforcement agency under court order; or (4) when necessary for a legitimate business purpose. Sets forth requirements for the consent exception, including an alternative consent to disclosure which: (1) is limited to the name and address of the user; and (2) the user has been given an opportunity to prohibit. Sets forth requirements for a court order for disclosure to a Federal or State law enforcement agency. Makes any person or entity that violates the prohibitions of this Act liable to any person aggrieved for equitable and declaratory relief, actual damages (with a minimum liquidated amount), punitive damages, and attorney's fees and litigation expenses."
