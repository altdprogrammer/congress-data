Requires the Secretary of Defense, in determining the purposes for which such transfer authority will be used, to ensure that an appropriate portion of such authority is used to transfer to operation and maintenance accounts of DOD for FY 1988 funds for: (1) depot maintenance activities sufficient to reduce service backlogs; and (2) pay of civilian personnel in an amount sufficient to ensure that no such employees are released due to insufficient funding. Directs the Secretary to: (1) give special consideration and priority to DOD civilian employees, readiness, and more efficient acquisition processes; and (2) provide funds for other high-priority readiness items."
