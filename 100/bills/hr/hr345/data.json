Requires anyone convicted of such offense to be quarantined for five years under supervision of the Public Health Service or until there is a cure, whichever occurs first. Defines \"bodily fluid\" and \"transfer.\" Creates as an affirmative defense for anyone charged with such offense proof that: (1) the use of a condom prevented the transfer of bodily fluids, after consent following full disclosure of the risk; or (2) that such transfer occurred after advice from a physician that he or she was noninfectious. Limits consent or previous AIDS infection of the transferee as a defense."
