Authorizes the Director, under the drug control and system improvement grant program, to make grants to States, for use by States and local governments, to: (1) enforce State and local laws that establish offenses similar to those established under the Controlled Substances Act; and (2) improve the functioning of the criminal justice system with emphasis on violent crime and serious offenders. Requires such grants to provide additional personnel, equipment, training, technical assistance, and information systems for more widespread apprehension, prosecution, adjudication, and detention and rehabilitation of persons who violate these laws, and to assist the victims of such crimes (other than with compensation). Sets forth various types of program eligible for such grants program. Emphasizes coordination and integration of efforts at all government levels.

Revises provisions for allocation of Federal assistance to State and local programs to increase the minimum formula grant allocations to States and to territories.
