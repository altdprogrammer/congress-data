    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to define \"industry\" for the purpose of filing for import relief as companies or firms comprising a certain sector of the industrial base. Requires that increased imports must be a cause of injury to the domestic industry for import relief purposes. (Current law requires that imports be a \"substantial cause\" of such injury.) Suspends liquidation of imports covered by an import relief petition. Authorizes the President to apply such import relief to the articles with respect to which liquidation is suspended. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to change the method of determining the exporter's sale price for purposes of assessing antidumping duties. Prohibits the administering authority from deducting indirect selling expenses (as an offset of the exporter's expenses) from foreign market value."
