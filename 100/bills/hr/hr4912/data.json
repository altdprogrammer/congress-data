Directs the President to transfer funds appropriated by this Act to various Government agencies and activities in such amounts as such agencies can use to more effectively fight the war against drugs, to treat addicts, and to cooperate with international agencies. Prohibits the use of such funds: (1) to engage in any activity prohibited by Federal laws or for which authority from the Congress was requested and denied; (2) except for purposes set forth in this Act, or under the authority of such agencies or activities authorized by law; and (3) to finance long-term or permanent facilities and equipment not primarily used for the war against drugs, other than for an interagency data system useful for other purposes. Declares that the war against illegal drugs constitutes a dire emergency. Directs that sums provided under this Act shall not be considered to be within the funding ceiling for a given function or section under any budgetary rule, resolution, or agreement previously adopted."
