Abolishes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Transfers Commission functions, assets, and staff to the Nuclear Safety Agency. Sets forth transition procedures. Title II: Standardization and Licensing - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Agency to establish procedures for the preapproval of a limited number of standardized facility designs for production or utilization facilities for a ten-year period. Authorizes the Agency to consider design approval requests for any major subsystem that represents discrete elements of a production or utilization facility. Requires the Agency to specify by regulation the criteria and requirements for any subsystem approval. States that a design approval shall be considered to be a license. Sets forth guidelines for the issuance of a design approval, including ten-year renewal terms. Authorizes the Director to issue a site approval permit for a ten-year period even if an application for a construction permit or operating license has not been filed. Outlines the site approval procedure and the procedures for facility construction permits and operating licenses. Title III: Conforming Amendments - Sets forth conforming amendments. Title IV: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
