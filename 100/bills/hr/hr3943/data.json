Requires Service officers to perform police functions with respect to public buildings and other property which the Administrator has a legal duty to protect and to perform other law enforcement functions assigned to them pursuant to law. Amends the Federal criminal code to grant such officers the authority to: (1) carry a firearm; (2) execute an order, warrant, subpoena, or other process issued under the authority of the United States for arrest, search and seizure, or production of evidence; and (3) make arrests without a warrant under certain circumstances.
