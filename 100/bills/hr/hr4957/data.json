Requires the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of the African Development Bank and the African Development Fund to initiate discussions and propose that such institutions provide advice and assistance to government creditors holding sovereign debt of any sub-Saharan government and to sub-Saharan governments which desire to finance programs with local currencies obtained through debt reduction and conversion to promote charitable, educational, and scientific purposes as a condition of reducing or converting such sovereign debt. Requires the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank to propose that the World Bank consider the extent to which borrowers have honored debt-for-development swap agreements as a factor in making loans to borrowing country governments."
