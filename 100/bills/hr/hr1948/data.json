Presents guidelines under which credits for employment service under the Railroad Retirement Act will apply to individuals who first became congressional employees or employees of the Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the National Mediation Board, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Railroad Retirement Board, or the General Accounting Office on or before December 31, 1983. States that Federal civil service retirement deposits may not be required for certain creditable service. Denies any annuity entitlement under the Railroad Retirement Act to an individual eligible to receive an annuity under a civil service retirement plan. Amends the definition of air traffic controller to include certain employees of the Department of Commerce, the National Weather Service, or the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service Facility whose duties involve providing information on the weather (thus making such employees eligible for early retirement without a reduced annuity)."
