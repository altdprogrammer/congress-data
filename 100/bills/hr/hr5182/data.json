    "text": "Amends the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enter into cooperative agreements with State and local government environmental law enforcement agencies for the exchange of information about the labeling of automobile gasoline octane ratings. Mandates that as part of such agreements the State and local agencies report octane rating labeling violations to the EPA. Directs the EPA to transmit such violation reports to the Federal Trade Commission (the Commission). Requires the Commission to investigate each violation to determine whether a civil action to recover a civil penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act is warranted. Establishes a civil penalty for octane rating violations under the Federal Trade Commission Act of a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $10,000."
