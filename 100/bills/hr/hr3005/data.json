Limits the amount of the credit based on the number of enrollees who may be cared for in the facility at one time. Provides for recapture of the credit if the facility ceases operation or changes ownership. Describes how the credit would function with respect to controlled groups of corporations, multiple employers, and partnerships. Sets out rules to govern the pass-through of credit when applicable. Limits use of the personal tax credit for employment-related day care expenses to taxpayers having adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 or less."
