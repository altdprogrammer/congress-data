Removes the volume limitations placed upon first repositories. Directs the Secretary of Energy to revise the repository mission plan to reflect the provisions of this Act and to submit such revisions within six months after enactment of this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from expending funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for any activity relating to a second or subsequent repository."
