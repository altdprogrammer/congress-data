Requires the Office of Minority Health to make grants to national minority organizations with local chapters or affiliates to provide coordination, technical assistance, and promotion. Specifies minimum and maximum limits for the grants. Authorizes appropriations for the grants to community-based organizations and for grants to national minority organizations for FY 1988 through 1990.
