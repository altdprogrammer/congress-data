    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a marking and recordkeeping system tracking medical equipment from its manufacture or importation to its disposal. Prohibits the disposal or disinfection of medical equipment waste at a facility which is not licensed. Requires such facilities to post a bond with the Administrator to insure compliance with licensing regulations. Requires handlers of medical equipment to give EPA representatives or representatives of a State having an authorized medical waste program information and access to information concerning such waste. Imposes penalties for violations of medical equipment marking, recordkeeping, and disposal requirements. Prohibits the interpretation of this Act as precluding more stringent State or local medical equipment tracking or disposal requirements. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator through FY 1991 for carrying out this Act's activities. Makes individuals who violate medical equipment tracking or disposal requirements liable for compensable damages caused by the disposal of such equipment. Sets forth defenses to such liability. Limits the time within which such actions may be brought. Reduces amounts payable to a plaintiff by the total of the relief or compensation they have previously received for such damages."
