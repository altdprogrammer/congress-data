Prohibits the NLRB from issuing an order directing reinstatement of any employee whose past or present conduct displays violence that would be an unfair labor practice if carried on by a labor organization. Includes among the unfair labor practices of a labor organization any interference with employees exercising their statutory rights. Provides for investigations and injunctive relief in cases of labor organizations' unfair labor practices involving violence, as long as a petition for such relief is filed within seven days of the filing of the unfair labor practice charge. Directs the NLRB to order awards of treble backpay and special damages to employees suffering loss of wages and other damages as a result of violent conduct qualifying as an unfair labor practice."
