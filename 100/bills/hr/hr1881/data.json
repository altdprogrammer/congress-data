Bell and North Haven Board of Education v. Bell). Amends title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to state that such Act's prohibition of sex discrimination shall be inapplicable to educational institutions which are controlled by, or closely associated with the tenants of, a particular religious organization if the application of such prohibition would be inconsistent with the organization's religious intent. (Current law provides that such prohibitions are inapplicable where the educational institutions are controlled by religious organizations.) States that nothing in such Act shall be construed to grant or deny any right relating to abortion."
