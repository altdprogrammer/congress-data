    "date": "1987-04-21", 
    "text": "Title I: Siting and Licensing - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to revise the procedural guidelines under which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall issue construction permits and operating licenses for production and utilization facilities and for thermal neutron power generation facilities. Directs the Commission to publish in the Federal Register a notice of the intended operation of such facilities prior to their commencement of operation. Outlines the procedure according to which the Commission shall hold a public hearing upon written request. Authorizes the Commission to issue a site permit for a site approval for one or more production or utilization facilities for a ten-year period (including facility designs for thermal neutron power generation) even though a construction permit application has not been filed. States that filing or issuance fees shall not be required for either a site permit application, amendment or renewal, or for a thermal neutron power generation facility design. Prescribes early site review procedures. Directs the Commission to propose regulations establishing procedures and criteria applicable to thermal neutron power generation facilities licensed for construction or operation. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Adds new definitions to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Title III: Conforming Amendments - Makes conforming amendments to such Act. Requires the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards to review each application for a construction permit or a facility operating license, and to submit a report thereon. Title IV: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
