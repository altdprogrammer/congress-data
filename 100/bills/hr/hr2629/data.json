Prohibits certain size lakes, rivers, and streams from being meandered if title to lands beneath such navigable waters did not vest in the State under the Submerged Lands Act. Provides that when the Secretary conveys land to an Alaska Native, a Native corporation, or the State which abuts or surrounds a lake, river, or stream which is required to be meandered, then any U.S. interest in the land under such lake, river, or stream shall vest in and not be charged against the acreage entitlement of such Native, Native corporation, or State. Incorporates and ratifies the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Interior and the State of Alaska dated March 28, 1984. Provides that nothing in this Act shall alter any land exchange agreement between the United States and a Native corporation. Title II: Approval of Conveyance in ANWR - Provides that the Secretary does not have authority to convey lands or interest in lands within the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (other than land validly selected prior to July 28, 1987), without prior approval by the Congress. Title III: Approval of Public Land Order - Includes specified lands comprising 325,000 acres described in Public Land Order 6607 in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to be administered in accordance with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Directs the Secretary to prepare a report which assesses the effects of the implementation of this Act on Conservation System Units (CSUs) as defined by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and makes recommendations for appropriate action. Requires that such report: (1) identify and estimate the acreage of all lands currently patented to or selected by a Native, Native Corporation, or the State pursuant to specified Acts that are within the boundaries of CSUs; (2) establish priorities for the acquisition of such lands; and (3) make recommendations as to administrative or congressional action deemed appropriate to reduce any adverse effects of this Act on the management of lands or resources within CSUs. Directs the Secretary to submit such report within one year of the date of enactment of this Act to specified congressional committees."
