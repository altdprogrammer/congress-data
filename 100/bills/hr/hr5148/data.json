Defines an \"underground fighter\" as any individual who: (1) as a member of the U.S. armed forces between December 7, 1941, and August 16, 1945, served as a guerrilla fighter resisting forces hostile to the United States or concealed himself from a hostile force for more than ten days while in danger of capture or after escaping as a prisoner of war; (2) is, or was at death, a U.S. citizen, national, or permanent resident alien; and (3) was never separated from the U.S. armed forces, except under honorable conditions. Provides that the compensation allowed to any underground fighter shall be five dollars for each day he served as a guerrilla fighter or concealed himself from hostile forces. Provides that any claim allowed by the Commission shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury and paid by such Secretary. Declares that any claim must be filed with the Commission within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires the Commission to complete its determination for any such claim no later than one year after such claim is filed. Authorizes appropriations."
