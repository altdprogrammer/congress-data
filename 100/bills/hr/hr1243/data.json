    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President, with regard to trade negotiations with Canada, to enter into tariff agreements relating to specified items of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, and to proclaim the modification or elimination of existing duties on such items. Limits the President's authority to the following items: (1) dialysis cyclers; (2) packaging goods for tea; (3) dried fababeans; (4) cat litter; (5) mechanics' tool boxes; (6) medical tubing; (7) synthetic fireplace materials; (8) spirits; (9) miners' safety lamps, components, and battery chargers; and (10) computerized paper cutter control retrofit units. Requires the President to proclaim such changes only to the extent that tariff concessions of equivalent value are granted by Canada in exchange for reductions authorized by this Act. Terminates the President's authority five years after enactment of this Act."
