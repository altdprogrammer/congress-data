    "text": "Amends the Foreign Missions Act (title II of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956) to prohibit a foreign mission from allowing the use of its premises by an unaffiliated alien for any purpose which is incompatible with its status as a foreign mission, including use as a residence. Requires as a condition of a nonimmigrant visa for admission to the United States that a nonimmigrant alien may not use any foreign mission of a foreign country for any purpose which is incompatible with its status as a foreign mission. Allows an exception to such requirement for a nonimmigrant alien who is a member, or a family member of a member, of any foreign mission of that country. Requires the Secretary of State to instruct each consular officer to notify each alien, at the time of application for a nonimmigrant visa, of such condition. Allows the Secretary to waive such restrictions with respect to all foreign missions of a country 30 days after providing written notification of such a waiver to certain committees of the Congress."
