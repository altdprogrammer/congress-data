Amends the Fishermen's Protective Act to extend, from October 1, 1988, to October 1, 1989, the termination date of provisions authorizing the Secretary of State to make reimbursements for certain losses upon the seizure of a U.S. documented commercial fishing vessel by a foreign country. Changes the composition of the National Fish and Seafood Promotional Council. Amends the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988 to change the circumstances in which the Secretary of Commerce may order certain fishing vessels to leave the Licensing Area, all Limited Areas, and all Closed Areas."
