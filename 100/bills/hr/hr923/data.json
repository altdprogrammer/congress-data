    "text": "Family Farm Targeting and Marketing Act of 1987 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to revise 1988 through 1990 wheat and feed grain price support provisions. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture on February 15 of the calendar year to make advance payments to participating wheat and corn producers. Sets 1988 through 1990 target prices at $5.00 per bushel for wheat and $3.50 per bushel for corn, respectively. Prohibits in-kind target or advance target payments. Directs the Secretary to assure that only persons actively engaged in farming receive farm program benefits. Sets 1988 through 1990 crop acreage bases at 1987 levels. Bases farm program payment yields on the preceding five crop years. Repeals acreage limitation and set-aside cross-compliance provisions. (Eliminates cross-compliance for price support purposes.) Prohibits the mixing of export grain with dust or other nongrain material, except to destroy insects or injurious fungi. Increases conservation reserve acreage. Expresses the intent of the Congress with respect to the mandatory nature of the pilot barter program. Directs the Secretary to establish a farm land purchasing facility in the Department of Agriculture. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the agricultural export expansion program through FY 1990. Increases targeted export assistance funds (or equivalent commodity values)."
