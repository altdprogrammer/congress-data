    "text": "Presidential Directives and Records Accountability Act - Defines an \"executive directive\" to mean any written instrument, other than a Presidential proclamation or executive order, that: (1) is signed or endorsed by, or is issued at the direction of, the President or an appointee in the Executive Office of the President; and (2) establishes policy, directs the carrying out of law or policy, authorizes or requires the use of appropriated funds or other resources (including personnel), or otherwise asserts or appears to assert an authority of the President. Provides that an executive directive does not include a finding with respect to intelligence activities. Sets forth requirements for filing such directives with the Office of the Federal Register, the Archivist of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President pro tempore of the Senate. Provides for informing employees in the Executive Office of the President or Vice President of the requirements of this Act. Establishes an Office of Records Management in the Executive Office of the President to be responsible for securing compliance with this Act. Declares that the Archivist has the final authority in the executive branch to determine what constitutes a record for records management purposes."
