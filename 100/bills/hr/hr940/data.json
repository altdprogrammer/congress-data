    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate",

    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Marine Plastic Pollution Prevention Act of 1987 - Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to revise the categories of ships to which the Act applies. Amends provisions relating to adequacy and criteria for pollution reception facilities to: (1) cover reception facilities for mixtures containing oil or noxious liquid substances; and (2) require the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to prescribe regulations and additional measures and requirements respecting the adequacy of reception facilities for garbage. Authorizes the Secretary, in determining the adequacy of reception facilities, to consider the number and types of seagoing and other ships using the port or terminal. Directs the Secretary, if reception facilities of a port or terminal meet the requirements of Annexes I and II to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (the Convention) and certain regulations, after consultation, to issue a certificate to that effect to the applicant. Provides for the denial of entry to ships to ports and terminals which do not have such certificates. Revises provisions relating to inspections of ships for violations to apply: (1) provisions relating to notifying the master and taking action under the Convention to all ships rather than to specified classes of ships; and (2) such provisions to inspections relating to possible violations of Annex I or Annex II of the Convention by certain types of ships. Adds new inspection provisions relating to disposal of garbage in violation of the requirements of Annex V to the Convention. Revises provisions relating to the authority of the Secretary to refer to other countries matters involving violations by certain foreign ships. Requires any action taken with respect to violations to be in accordance with international law. Revises provisions relating to procedures for amendments to the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL Protocol). Directs the head of each Federal agency which operates or contracts for the operation of certain ships to report to the Congress regarding the inability to comply with specified provisions of the Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating and the heads of other interested agencies, to commence a program to educate the public regarding the harmfulness of plastic materials in the marine environment."
