Makes the Associate Director directly responsible to the Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. Requires the Associate Director to report annually to the Congress with respect to activities and expenditures. Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish a Seabed Consortium (within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act); (2) investigate the technical and institutional feasibility of subseabed disposal; and (3) conduct a public information program about such feasibility. Requires the Consortium to: (1) submit a research plan and proposed budget for the Secretary's approval within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act; (2) implement an approved plan by January 1, 1995; and (3) report to the Congress in 1990 and 1995 regarding the plan's progress. Requires the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the Department of Commerce to assist the Secretary of Energy and the Consortium in the development and implementation of the plan. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants or enter into contracts to implement this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
