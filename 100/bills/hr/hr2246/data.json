    "text": "Jobs for Employable Dependent Individuals Act - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) to entitle each State to the payment of a bonus for the successful job placement of certain employable dependent individuals. Makes the following persons eligible to be counted for an incentive bonus: (1) a head of a household who has received benefits continuously under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act or under cash and medical assistance to refugees under the Immigration and Nationality Act, or a blind or disabled person who has received benefits continuously under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act, for at least two years prior to participation in education, training, and support activities designed to provide jobs for such individuals, and who has no work experience for the year preceding the year for which the eligibility determination is made; or (2) a head of a household who receives benefits at the time determination of eligibility is made under AFDC, under cash and medical assistance to refugees, or a blind or disabled individual who receives benefits under the SSI program, who has not attained 22 years of age, has not completed secondary school or its equivalent (except that this does not apply to blind or disabled persons), and has no work experience for the year preceding the year for which the eligibility determination is made. Requires that such individual: (1) participate in education, training, and support activities designed to provide jobs for such individuals; (2) be placed in nonsubsidized employment (or in the case of a blind or disabled individual, in employment or supported employment) for at least one year after such participation; (3) receive from such employment an income equal to or greater than the cash benefits under the relevant aid program; and (4) no longer qualify for such aid benefits. Provides that the amount of the incentive bonus paid to each State will be equal to: (1) 40 percent of the placement bonus base for each successful placement; (2) 50 percent for the second continuous year of such employment; and (3) 60 percent for the third year. Includes in such calculation only placements in excess of those during FY 1986 or another base period agreed upon by the Governor and the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). Sets forth a formula for the determination of the placement bonus base for each category of eligible recipient. Sets forth State application requirements. Requires adequate verification of placements for approval of applications. Directs the Governor to reserve an amount equal to the amount the State receives for incentive bonuses and to: (1) set aside up to 15 percent of the amount so reserved in each fiscal year for distribution to specified participating entities to support the costs of establishing and maintaining systems necessary for the operation of the incentive bonus program; and (2) distribute the remainder to participating agencies, private industry councils in service delivery areas (SDAs), and service providers, including community-based organizations, that contribute to the incentive bonus program. Limits use of these remainder funds to the following activities designed for the job preparation and job placement of participants: (1) outreach; (2) basic and remedial education, including English language training; (3) training and supportive services, including child care; and (4) transportation. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the incentive bonus program and to report the results to the Congress within three years after this Act's enactment. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue jointly regulations relating to the safeguarding and sharing, among certain participating entities, of pertinent information concerning programs under the incentive bonus program. Reallots unexpected funds exceeding 20 percent of a State's JTPA fiscal year allocation for certain training services for the disadvantaged, plus any balance from the prior year, to States that did not have such excess funds. Requires the Secretary to reallot such monies in accordance with States' need for the ability to use the funds for the incentive bonus program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide improved information and technical assistance on performance standards adjustment approaches; (2) collect data that more adequately identify hard-to-serve individuals and long-term welfare dependency; (3) provide guidance on setting performance goals at a service provider level that encourage increased service to targeted persons; and (4) reexamine performance standards to ensure that they provide maximum flexibility in serving the hard-to-serve, especially long-term welfare recipients. Establishes a basic measure for performance applicable to certain adult education programs. Directs the Secretary to prescribe standards to determine whether the basic measure is being achieved. Lists factors to be included in such standards. Subjects the new programs established under this Act to the JTPA's requirements relating to the submission of a plan, plan review and approval procedures, and performance standards. Requires the Secretary, in prescribing performance standards relating to the placement of certain employable dependent individuals, to weight the placement of such persons in accordance with the average costs of successful placement of such persons compared to the average cost of successful placement of individuals eligible for other specified services for disadvantaged persons."
