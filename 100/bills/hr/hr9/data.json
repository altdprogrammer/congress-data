Prohibits either House from considering any concurrent resolution on the budget which includes reconciliation instructions requiring a reduction in spending authority derived from any trust fund funded by specified tax receipts below the amount of the revenues and unobligated balance of the trust fund. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to exempt from reduction under any sequestration order payments from trust funds funded by specified tax receipts."
