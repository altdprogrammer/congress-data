Authorizes the Commission to contract for the lease of and improvements to real property in the United States for the use of the Commission as office space. Revises the limits on the amount which the Commission may pay: (1) with respect to claims for injury to, or loss of, property or personal injury or death arising from operation of the Canal; and (2) regarding injuries incurred in the locks of the Canal when the vessel was not under the control of a Panama Canal pilot. Provides for the compensation of members of the supervisory board of the Commission while on official Commission business."
