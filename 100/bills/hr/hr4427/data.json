Rept. 100-882) Immigration Exclusion and Deportation Amendments of 1988 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make only the following classes of aliens ineligible to receive visas for admission into the United States: (1) any alien with a communicable disease of public health significance; (2) any alien with a record of recent physical or mental disorder that poses a threat to property or safety; (3) any alien with a drug addiction; (4) any alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, with specified exceptions; (5) any alien convicted of specified drug violations or involved in drug trafficking; (6) any alien who has engaged in prostitution, or procurement of prostitutes, within ten years of the date of application for U.S. entry; (7) any alien likely to be a security risk; (8) any alien who has engaged in terrorist activity or likely to engage in such activity (including, for purposes of such Act, an officer, representative, or spokesman of the Palestine Liberation Organization); (9) any alien whose entry would endanger the lives or property of U.S. citizens living abroad; (10) any alien whose entry would convey the impression of U.S. support for a government or group that the United States does not recognize or support, or whose entry would have a serious negative effect on U.S. diplomatic relations; (11) any alien who participated in Nazi persecutions; (12) any alien who is a trade union officer, official or employee of an organization which is an instrument of a totalitarian government, with exceptions for members of independent associations; (13) any alien who is likely to become a public charge, with admission on bond at the discretion of the Attorney General; (14) any alien seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor, with specified exceptions (teaching, postgraduate research, and science or arts), or in situations of insufficient U.S. workers; (15) any alien who is a graduate of a medical school not accredited by a body approved for such purpose by the Secretary of Education, with certain exceptions; (16) any excluded or deported alien who seeks readmission within one year of the event, unless such readmission is consented to by the Attorney General; (17) any alien seeking to enter the United States by fraud or the willful misrepresentation of a material fact; (18) any stowaway alien; (19) any alien who aids any other alien in illegal entry; (20) any immigrant not in possession of a valid immigrant visa and passport at the time of admission; (21) any nonimmigrant without a valid passport authorizing the alien to return to the country from which he or she came or without a valid nonimmigrant visa or border crossing card, (provides for a Guam visa waiver for up to 15-day pleasure or business entries); and (22) any alien ineligible for U.S. citizenship, including a person who left or remained outside the United States to avoid U.S. military service in time of war or national emergency. Repeals the ideological grounds for exclusion. Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to jointly develop guidelines for the review of exclusion lists and other mechanisms used to screen alien visa applicants. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to report jointly to the appropriate committees regarding the development of such guidelines (within one year) and the results of the review of such alien lists (within two years).
