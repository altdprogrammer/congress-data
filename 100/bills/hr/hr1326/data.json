Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, if amounts appropriated for migrant health centers or amounts appropriated for community health centers exceed specified amounts in FY 1988, to make all of the excess available for grants to such centers for the provision of services for the reduction of infant mortality, including counseling and testing routinely offered to women of childbearing age with respect to infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and for the development and coordination of referral arrangements between the centers and entities for the medical management of infants and pregnant women. Directs the Secretary, in making grants, to give priority to centers in areas, or serving medically underserved populations, where there is a substantial incidence or a significant increase in the incidence of infant mortality. Directs the Secretary, in making grants to community health centers, to give special consideration to the needs of frontier areas."
