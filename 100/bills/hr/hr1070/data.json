Directs the Secretary to provide specified financial assistance, including rental assistance, to facilitate such sale. Prohibits subsequent property transfers during the term of the transferred loan unless there is no longer a need for such low-income housing. Authorizes appropriations to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund for reimbursement of financial assistance provided under this Act."
