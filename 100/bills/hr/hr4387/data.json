    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1988-08-10", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-879) Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities in specified departments and agencies of the Government, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Defense (DOD). Places certain restrictions on the use of funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act with respect to: (1) the purchase of Guardrail RC-12K aircraft and sensor suites; and (2) foreign counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Declares that the authorized amounts and personnel ceilings for such intelligence activities are those specified in the Classified Schedule of Authorizations prepared by the committee of conference to accompany this measure. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions, with limitations. Restricts support for military and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1989. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 244 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Provides that such staff shall be administered in the same manner as the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1989. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to make technical amendments in retirement annuities and survivor benefits for divorced spouses of CIA employees to conform with civil service and Foreign Service annuities and benefits. Title IV: General Provisions - Provides that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for employee benefits to be increased to meet increases in such benefits authorized by law. Requires the Director of the CIA and the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to specified congressional committees setting forth an analysis of each equal employment opportunity group's (as defined by this Act) representation in the CIA and the National Security Agency, and proposing a plan for rectifying any underrepresentation by September 30, 1991. Requires the Director and the Secretary to submit interim reports detailing the efforts made, and the progress realized, in achieving such objectives. Provides for the disclosure of information concerning live sightings of U.S. citizens reported as missing in action, prisoners of war, or unaccounted for from the Vietnam Conflict. Title V: Central Intelligence Agency Administrative Provisions - Allows the Director of Central Intelligence to grant appropriate relief to former CIA employees who have unfairly had their CIA careers adversely affected as a result of allegations concerning their loyalty to the United States. Requires the Director to submit reports to specified congressional committees regarding the use of such authority. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to permit certain employees who are subject to the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement System to elect to become subject to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Permits retired members of the uniformed services employed by the Director of Central Intelligence to receive compensation for serving on Central Intelligence Advisory Committees. Sets forth reporting requirements with respect to the activities of the Inspector General at the CIA. Title VI: FBI Enhanced Counterintelligence Authorities - Requires the Directors of the FBI and the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a demonstration project on the effect of providing payments to personnel upon directed assignment to the New York Field Division from another geographical location (and to New York Field Division employees who are subject to directed geographical transfer or reassignment) on the recruitment and retention of personnel and on field operations in the New York Field Division of the FBI. Requires the Directors to submit annual reports to the President and the Congress concerning the results of such project. Title VII: Department of Defense - Allows the Secretary of Defense, with certain restrictions, to use appropriated funds, and funds other than appropriated funds, for foreign cryptologic support. Prohibits the use of non-appropriated funds to acquire items or services for the principal benefit of the United States. Requires reports to the Congress on the use of funds expended for foreign cryptologic support. Permits the Secretary of Defense to designate an Assistance Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (in which case the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence would be redesignated as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control and Communications). Allows the Secretary of Defense, during FY 1989, to pay a death gratuity to the surviving dependents of a member of the armed forces who, while serving assigned to a defense attache office, died as a result of hostile or terrorist activities. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress on the advisability of permanent law permitting the payment of such death gratuities."
