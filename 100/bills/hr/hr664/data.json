Sets FY 1986 support levels as minimum levels for subsequent fiscal years. Increases income levels for purposes of defining low and moderate income. Defines \"persons of very-low income.\" Requires community development block grant applications to be submitted to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development prior to the receipt of any grant funds. Prohibits a grantee from using such funds in a manner that will result in the involuntary displacement of low- and moderate-income persons. Requires grant applications to include a neighborhood economic development strategy. Authorizes multiyear grants for nonentitlement areas."
