Specifies that such cooperation includes: (1) assigning or detailing any member of the U.S. armed forces to serve as a defense (or military) attache in South Africa; (2) cooperating in any way with an individual serving as a defense (or military) attache at a South African diplomatic mission in the United States; and (3) any activity relating to the collection of intelligence. Repeals provisions of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 relating to restrictions on intelligence agency cooperation with South Africa."
