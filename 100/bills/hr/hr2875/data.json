Authorizes a waiver of this requirement, but not to exceed six months, when either the Congress or the President declares that an emergency exists justifying such a waiver. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to publish in the Federal Register a list of commodities and products subject to this Act. Terminates this Act's provisions on October 1, 1991."
