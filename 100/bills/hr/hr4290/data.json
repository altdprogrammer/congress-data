    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1988-03-30", 
    "text": "Recycling Markets Development Act of 1988 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish labeling requirements for all paper and cardboard products and all food and beverage containers manufactured in or imported into the United States which cannot be recycled and which are not made from at least ten percent recycled materials. Treats any product or container which does not contain such required label as in violation of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Revises the Federal procurement provisions of the Solid Waste Disposal Act to restrict certain agency decisions not to procure paper meeting minimum content requirements for recovered materials and to revise the guidelines issued by the Administrator with respect to Federal agencies complying with the requirements of such Act. Requires the Administrator, within two years of enactment of this Act, to prepare final guidelines for used oil and plastics. Requires the issuance of a uniform national standard for paper for procuring agencies with at least ten percent being the minimum content of the past consumer recovered materials. Makes a State eligible for certain Federal assistance under such Act only if the State has adopted procurement rules for paper which conform to Federal standards. Establishes an Office of Waste Reduction, Reuse, and Recycling within Office of Solid Waste in EPA, to perform: (1) the responsibilities of the Administrator with respect to labeling requirements and mandatory uniform standards for paper; and (2) other related duties with respect to recycling programs. Directs the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to study: (1) the economic incentives and disincentives provided by Federal and State government which affect competition between recycled and virgin materials; and (2) foreign recycling operations which might be used in the United States. Requires EPA and the Secretary of Commerce to cooperate fully with OTA."
