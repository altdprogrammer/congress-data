Terminates such prohibition on the date on which the President certifies to the Congress that the South African Government has rescinded the emergency press restrictions imposed on journalists in South Africa. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should close all South African consulates and tourist bureaus in the United States; (2) the President should impose a case-by-case review of visa requests for entry into the United States by South African nationals; and (3) such requests should be scrutinized in light of the South African Government's actions in allowing South African opposition press and anti-apartheid groups to travel to the United States."
