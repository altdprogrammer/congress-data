    "text": "Immigration and Nationality Efficiency Amendments of 1987 - Title I: Entry and Adjustment of Status - Part A: Entry and Adjustment of Status of Immigrants - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exclude returning permanent resident aliens from the definition of \"entry\" for purposes of this Act. Provides for the admission of a limited number of specified employees of multinational corporations and their families as special immigrants. Requires members of professions to have appropriate college degrees or significant work experience for purposes of such Act. Allows surviving spouses of citizens to petition for entry under immediate relative status. Reduces the Amerasian sponsorship requirement from five years to two years. Allows private agency sponsorship for adult Amerasians. Repeals the employment offer requirement for preference entry purposes for specified aliens with extraordinary ability in the arts. Extends reentry permit length from not more than two years to five years. Part B: Entry and Adjustment of Status of Nonimmigrants - Provides for the temporary admission into the United States of operators of (passenger) motor common carriers. Broadens the classification of nonimmigrant treaty trader and investor to include supervisory services or transfer of technology. Permits admission as nonimmigrants of non-treaty traders or investors who invest substantial amounts of money and employ at least five U.S. workers from countries providing similar reciprocal immigration rights to U.S. nationals. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to monitor such admissions and report to the Congress within two years. Separates \"H\" status nonimmigrants into professionals or executives and aliens of distinguished merit and ability. Requires alien trainees to participate in formal training programs. Part C: Refugee-Related Provisions - Provides for permanent resident status to be granted to refugees immediately upon entry. Title II: Exclusion and Deportation - Authorizes the waiver of literacy requirements (for purposes of exclusion) for sole surviving siblings 55 years of age or older. Provides for the deportation of an alien who enters the United States under a work-related preference visa and does not engage in such employment or occupation within 12 months of entry. Replaces the existing individual suspension of deportation reporting requirement with an annual reporting requirement regarding numbers and nationality of suspended deportations. Title III: Enforcement - Provides for the temporary release on parole of an alien involved in exclusion or deportation proceedings. Prohibits such release under specified circumstances. Increases specified Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) fines. Authorizes the INS to receive 50 percent of such amounts. Title IV: Citizenship and Naturalization - Permits a child born outside the United States to derive citizenship automatically upon naturalization of the parent if the child resides permanently in the United States and is less than 18 years old at the time such naturalization occurs. Permits nonprofit organizations approved by the Attorney General to receive naturalization material. Directs the Commissioner of the INS to provide for, and make available to the Congress and to the public, statistical information useful in evaluating the social, economic, environmental, and demographic effects of this Act's provisions."
