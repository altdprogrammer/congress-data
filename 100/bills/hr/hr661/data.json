Grants such borrower first right of refusal to reacquire the property at the end of such occupancy period. Prohibits the sale of System-held land if such sale will have a detrimental effect on land values in specified depressed farming areas. Requires offers to sell System-held land to be made through local real estate agents. Requires the leasing of such land to be on a competitive bid basis. Requires a System institution with individual shareholders to provide them with a copy of the bylaws and upon request a copy of the charter or articles of incorporation."
