Restricts the expenditure of such funds to pay: (1) any loans, debts, or expenses incurred by the Tribe for the purchase of land or for obtaining or defending rights of access to a specified area; (2) for the formulation of a Zuni resource development plan; (3) all costs, attorneys fees, and expenses incurred by the Tribe in the prosecution of such civil actions; and (4) all invoices submitted to the Tribe for which proper vouchers have been received prior to May 1, 1988, and subsequently approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Requires that all funds not required to make such payments be transferred into, and constitute the corpus of, the Zuni Resource Development Trust Fund. Designates the Secretary as the trustee of the Fund. Directs the Secretary and the Tribe, to jointly formulate a resource development plan for the Zuni Indian Reservation, including plans for: (1) sustained development of renewable resources; (2) a labor intensive program of watershed rehabilitation; (3) a computerized system of management and monitoring; (4) the funding, training, and education of Zuni professional positions and a Zuni labor force to implement the overall plan; (5) cooperative programs with the BIA and other private or public entities to provide technical assistance; (6) the acquisition of lands necessary for sustained development."
