Requires the employer to notify employers, before the election, of all the material facts concerning the plan, including its terms and asset transfer provisions. Applies these requirements only when: (1) at least 30 percent of a corporation's employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit; and (2) the plan entails transfers of assets from a defined benefit plan and is proposed by employees represented by a collective bargaining unit in a corporation having more than one such unit."
