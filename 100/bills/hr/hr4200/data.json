Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Maritime Commission for FY 1989. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to revise Federal provisions relating to the making of student incentive payments to individuals enrolled in State maritime academies. Excludes, until October 1, 1990, certain classes of vessels intended for offshore oil and gas exploration or development or for operation of inland waterways from coverage under Federal ship mortgage insurance provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to submit to the Congress a feasibility study on providing training ships to the State maritime academies as authorized by provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. Amends the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933 to remove, for ships not carrying passengers, the requirement that terms and conditions of the transportation be framed under glass and posted on board the vessel. Requires the Maritime Administration to disclose to credit reporting agencies debts of more than a specified amount that arise out of loan activities of the Maritime Administration authorized by this Act and that are delinquent more than 90 days."
