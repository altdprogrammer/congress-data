    "text": "Nonintervention Act of 1988 - Prohibits the use of Government funds for the expenses of introducing U.S. armed forces into or over the territory or waters of Honduras or Nicaragua for combat unless: (1) the Congress has declared war or enacted specific authorization for such introduction; or (2) such introduction is necessary to repel an armed attack upon the United States or U.S. armed forces, to prevent imminent attack, to retaliate in the event of such an attack, or to protect U.S. citizens or nationals from a direct and imminent threat to their lives. Requires the President to submit a report to the Congress pursuant to the War Powers Resolution within 48 hours of such introduction. Defines \"combat\" to include situations in which: (1) overt acts of warfare are taking place, such as an exchange of fire or aerial or naval bombardment, regardless of whether U.S. armed forces are participating; and (2) U.S. armed forces are subject to hostile fire or the explosion of hostile mines. Prohibits the use of Government funds for the expenses of participation by U.S. armed forces in any military exercise: (1) in Honduras unless the President has notified the Congress in writing at least 30 days in advance; or (2) within 20 miles of the boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras. Prohibits the use of Government funds for the expenses of any number of members of the U.S. armed forces in Honduras greater than the number who were in Honduras on March 15, 1988, with specified exceptions."
