Directs HMOs and CMPs to give their enrollees at least 60 days advance notice of any change in the premium charged for enrollment. Provides that if there is a cancellation of the contract between an HMO or CMP and a hospital or clinic through which such organization provides services, or an interruption in such services during contract negotiations the organization shall notify its enrollees of such cancellation or interruption within the period prescribed by State law for providing notice to physicians or, in the absence of such law, within seven days after such cancellation or interruption. Requires that such notice include an explanation of alternative hospitals or clinics through which enrollees will receive covered services."
