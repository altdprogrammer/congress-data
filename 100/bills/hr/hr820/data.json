Requires the Governor, before raising the speed limit, to submit to the Secretary of Transportation information supporting the determination of the projected effects on highway safety. Directs the Secretary to notify the Governor if the Secretary determines that a speed limit increase is likely to lead to a significant decline in highway safety on the affected roadway. Requires the Governor of each State in which a higher speed limit is in effect to report to the Secretary every seven years concerning the safety factors taken into account in setting the speed limit. Authorizes the Governor to withdraw the higher speed limit permission upon determination that the safety requirements upon which the higher speed was based are no longer being met."
