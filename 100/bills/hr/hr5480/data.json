Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1988 to make such provision for House of Representatives staff. Authorizes per diem for living expenses of Members whose tax home is in the area of Washington, D.C., and for Members whose tax home is in the Member's legislative district. Declares that per diem is not payable to Members whose tax home is 50 or fewer miles from the U.S. Capitol Building. Declares that per diem shall not be treated as income or remuneration for tax purposes. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to disallow a deduction for living expenses for Members. Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1983 to prohibit a Member from accepting honoraria."
