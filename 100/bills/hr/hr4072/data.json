    "text": "Medicaid Infant Mortality Amendments of 1988 - Title I: Medicaid Coverage of Pregnant Women and Infants - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to cover pregnant women and infants under age one whose family income is below the Federal poverty level. Prohibits States from: (1) imposing a resource eligibility test on pregnant women and infants which is more restrictive than a resource eligibility test imposed under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the the Act; or (2) reducing payment levels under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Act below the levels in effect on July 1, 1987. Requires that eligible pregnant women continue to receive Medicaid coverage through the month in which the 60th day following the end of pregnancy falls without regard to changes in family income. Title II: Promoting Medicaid Coverage of Pregnant Women and Infants - Reimburses States, at the Federal Medicaid assistance percentage, for outreach services identifying poor pregnant women and infants and assisting them in applying for Medicaid coverage. Requires that States make ambulatory prenatal care available to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period. Alters the rules for determining when such period ends. Makes clarification amendments regarding the qualifications of providers of covered ambulatory prenatal care. Title III: Assuring Payment for Necessary Services for Pregnant Women and Infants - Requires States to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, by April 1 each year, information pertaining to the supply of and demands for obstetrical services and proposed Medicaid payment rates for such services so that the Secretary may determine whether such rates are sufficient to ensure that obstetrical services will be at least as available to Medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population. Requires States to immediately revise rates determined to be insufficient. Directs States to: (1) establish exceptions to durational limits on Medicaid coverage of medically necessary inpatient hospital services furnished to infants in disproportionate share hospitals; and (2) adjust payments to such hospitals to take into account exceptionally costly and lengthy inpatient hospital services for infants. Title IV: Medicaid Relationship with Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Requires States to: (1) coordinate Medicaid services with the special supplemental food program's services for women, infants, and children under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and (2) notify Medicaid-eligible pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women and children under age five of the special supplemental food program benefits."
