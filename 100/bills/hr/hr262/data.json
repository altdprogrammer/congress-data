    "text": "Safe Pipeline Act of 1987 - Amends the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to direct the Secretary of Energy to promulgate minimum Federal standards requiring pipeline facilities operators to: (1) furnish appropriate local governments with detailed maps showing exact locations of pipeline facilities and a complete inventory and description of all substances transported through such facilities; (2) provide certain public safety agencies with such maps, inventories, and descriptions, including an operator's emergency and maintenance manual; (3) notify certain commercial and residential property owners of the location of certain pipeline facilities and of action to take if pipeline hazards are found; (4) post conspicuous signs on all public streets under which such pipeline facilities pass; (5) convert all required shut-off valves to automatic shut-off valves; (6) equip certain pipeline facilities with automatic shut-off valves; and (7) submit a complete inventory to the Secretary regarding all types of pipeline used in such operator's system. Requires the Secretary of Energy to promulgate minimum Federal standards to require testing and pipeline facilities inspections at specified intervals. Proscribes the siting of new pipelines within 150 feet of a residence, school, nursing home, hospital, or correctional institution, or any other permanently inhabited facility. Directs the Secretary to establish a liaison between the Office of Pipeline Safety and corresponding State agencies in order to coordinate effective responses to pipeline accidents. Subjects to a fine or imprisonment persons who damage or remove pipeline signs or right-of-way markers provided for by Federal law or regulation. Requires the Secretary to draft regulations requiring pipeline operators to participate in the creation of \"One-Call\" systems in those States where the operators' facilities exist. Requires excavators, demolitionists, and blasting operators to contact the \"One-Call\" number before commencing such activities. Imposes liability on such persons for damage to underground pipelines or utilities if they fail to contact the \"One-Call\" number. Requires the Secretary to establish a certification program for State pipeline inspectors to conduct pipeline inspections at the request of the Office of Pipeline Safety. Empowers certified State agents to enforce Federal rules governing pipeline facilities. Requires the Secretary to propose regulations for increased Federal oversight in the design and construction of new pipeline facilities."
