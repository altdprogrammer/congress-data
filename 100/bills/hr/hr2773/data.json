Authorizes the Secretary, on violation by any hospital or outpatient facility and with due process, to suspend or revoke all or part of any support received by the hospital. Authorizes the Secretary to consult with officials administering other Federal programs from which the hospital or outpatient facility receives support, regarding the suspension or revocation of such Federal support."
