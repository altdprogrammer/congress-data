Requires the Inspector General to be appointed by, report to, and be under the general supervision of, the head of each Federal entity governed by this Act. Requires the head of any Federal entity who removes an Inspector General from office to communicate the reasons for such removal to the Congress. Requires each Federal entity which is not a designated Federal entity to prepare and transmit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress a report which: (1) states whether there has been established in such entity an internal audit office that meets requirements under this Act; (2) lists actions taken to ensure that the entity's audits meet standards issued by the Comptroller General; and (3) summarizes matters relating to the personnel, programs, and operations of the entity referred to prosecutive authorities. Requires the Chief Postal Inspector of the United States Postal Service to: (1) hold the position of Inspector General of the United States Postal Service; (2) be under the general supervision of the Postmaster General; and (3) be appointed by the Governors of the United States Postal Service.

Sets forth information to be included in reports by the head of an establishment on final action taken on reports by Inspectors General. Authorizes audit unit directors or Inspectors General to administer to or take from any person an oath, affirmation, or affidavit when necessary. Requires that an audit entity of the Federal Government perform any reviews of Offices of Inspector General to determine whether internal controls are in place and whether audit standards, policies, and procedures are being followed. Provides that when the Coast Guard operates as a service of a department or agency other than the Department of Defense, a member of the Coast Guard shall be deemed to be an employee of such department or agency. Requires a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress by the head of each designated Federal entity on that entity's progress in establishing an Office of Inspector General. Requires the President to include in the budget a separate appropriation account for appropriations for each Office of Inspector General headed by a presidentially appointed Inspector General. Title II: Government Printing Office Inspector General - Government Printing Office Inspector General Act of 1988 - Establishes an Office of Inspector General in the Government Printing Office to: (1) conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the Government Printing Office; (2) provide leadership and coordination and recommend policies to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness; and (3) provide a means of keeping the Public Printer and the Congress fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies.
