Authorizes the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to hire passenger motor vehicles, purchase insurance, and advance funds, employ aliens, and acquire living quarters abroad. Authorizes the United States Parole Commission and the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated, to hire passenger motor vehicles, and authorizes the latter corporation to make certain expenditures and contracts. Requires the Attorney General to submit reports in FY 1989 and 1990 to certain congressional committees regarding all training of foreign law enforcement personnel conducted by the DOJ with funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act, specifying the number, by country, of such personnel, the agencies to which they were assigned in their home countries, the training locations, and the nature and extent of training. Specifies authorized uses of sums appropriated for FBI and DEA undercover investigative operations. Directs the FBI and DEA to conduct a detailed financial audit of each undercover investigative operation which is closed in FY 1989 or 1990, submit the audit results to the Attorney General, and submit a report to the Congress.

Requires periodic evaluations by the Attorney General of the overall efficiency and effectiveness of DOJ programs and annual specific program evaluations of selected subordinate organizations' programs, as determined by the priorities set either by the Congress or the Attorney General. Sets forth requirements for reprogramming of funds following written notification to the Congress. Requires a report to the Congress whenever, in FY 1989 or 1990, the Attorney General determines that the DOJ will contest, or refrain from defending, any provision of law enacted by the Congress in any proceeding because the position of the DOJ is that such provision is unconstitutional. Provides that in any proceeding in which the Attorney General (or any other DOJ officer on his authority) makes such a determination, any DOJ officer or employee makes such a decision, or the Attorney General determines that the DOJ will bring, or authorizes the bringing of, an action contesting the validity of any provision of law enacted by the Congress, the Attorney General shall not proceed in the name of the United States. Requires that such representation be in the name of the agency or department on whose behalf the Attorney General appears, or if he appears on behalf of the President, in the name of the President. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated under this Act to: (1) overturn or alter the per se prohibition against resale price maintenance in effect under Federal antitrust laws; (2) contract for the general management or overall operation of a penal or correctional institution; and (3) administer, or require that any individual take, a polygraph examination, unless administered in connection with an investigation of a specific incident involving a violation of law."
