    "text": "Legal Immigration Reform Act of 1988 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a two-tiered immigration level of 670,000 annual entries made up of specified numbers of \"family connection\" immigrants and \"independent\" (employment-related) immigrants. Sets forth FY 1990 through 1992 numerical limitations on backlogged immigrants. Requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor, State, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to report annually, beginning in FY 1993, to the President and to the appropriate congressional committees on the social, economic, and environmental impacts of immigration. Requires the President, at three-year intervals, to submit to the Congress a determination to maintain or change immigration levels. Provides that: (1) if the determination contains a change of less than ten percent, such change shall become effective unless the Congress objects within five months; and (2) if the determination contains a change of ten percent or more, the Congress must take specified affirmative approval action. Limits annual preference immigrants from each foreign country. Revises the immigration admissions preference system. Allocates \"family connection\" preferences as follows: (1) parents and unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens; (2) spouses and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent resident aliens; and (3) certain married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens and brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. Allocates \"independent\" preferences as follows: (1) special immigrants; (2) aliens with doctoral degrees or of exceptional ability; (3) skilled workers; (4) employer-commercial investors; and (5) selected immigrants chosen on a point system basis. Sets forth such point system. Sets forth a preference allocation for backlogged immigrants. Amends petitioning procedures and labor certification provisions. Provides for congressional veto procedures regarding refugee admissions."
