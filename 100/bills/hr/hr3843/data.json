Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to declare that the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress shall be the rate payable on the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits the House of Representatives or the Senate from considering a bill or resolution which would adjust the rate of pay of Members unless the bill or resolution deals with no other subject matter. Requires a recorded vote on such legislation. Prohibits the payment of an annuity or retired pay on the basis of any service performed as a Member of Congress, if the individual is convicted of any State or Federal felony committed after the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the restoration of such annuity or retired pay if such individual is pardoned by the Governor in the case of an offense against a State law."
