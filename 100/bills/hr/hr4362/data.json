Provides that such lands shall revert to the United States unless the lands have been used for the purposes specified in the application or other authorized uses within five years after the date of conveyance. Requires any party who has transferred ownership of any conveyed lands not used for such specified purposes to pay to the Secretary fair market value for such lands. Provides that no lands covered by an issued patent shall revert to the United States if such lands have been used for the disposal of solid waste or hazardous substances. Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to lands conveyed prior to enactment of this Act, to renounce the United States' reversionary interests in such lands upon finding that such lands have been used for the disposal of solid waste or hazardous substances. Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to lands leased prior to enactment of this Act, to convey in fee such leased lands without any provision for reversion to the United States upon finding that such lands have been used for the disposal of solid waste or hazardous substances. Prohibits the Secretary from making any conveyance of land or renunciation of reversionary interests under this Act until: (1) 60 days after regulations implementing this Act have been submitted to specified House and Senate committees; and (2) 30 days after notice of intention to make such conveyance or renunciation has been submitted to specified House and Senate committees, during the first three years after enactment of this Act."
