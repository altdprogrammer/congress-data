(Currently such levels are $5.02 per bushel for 1987, and a minimum of $4.50 per bushel for 1988 through 1990.) Limits 1987 through 1990 soybean supports to only those producers who restrict production to their soybean acreage base (as defined by this Act). Requires (current law authorizes) soybean loan repayment at the lesser of prevailing world prices or the crop loan level."
