    "date": "1987-06-04", 
    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to revise one of the factors to be considered for determining worker eligibility for trade adjustment assistance by providing that the Secretary of Labor's certification of eligibility of a group for such assistance shall not cover a worker whose last separation from a firm before his or her application for such assistance occurred more than two years (currently, one year) before the date of the petition on which such certification was granted. Changes a condition for determining the eligibility of a worker for such assistance by requiring such worker to have had, in the 104-week period (currently, 52-week period) ending with the week in which the employment separation occurred, at least 26 weeks of employment at wages of $30 or more a week in adversely affected employment with a single firm. Extends the period that such workers can receive retraining and payment of additional trade adjustment allowances from 26 to 52 weeks."
