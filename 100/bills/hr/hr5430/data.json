    "text": "Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit persons from dumping sewage sludge or industrial waste into the ocean without a permit. Prohibits all such dumping after 1992. Imposes dumping fees which increase with the approach of 1993. Requires that 85 percent of such fees be deposited in a trust account for the development of environmentally sound alternatives to ocean dumping or improvement in sewage sludge and industrial waste treatment and storage techniques. Pays the remainder of such fees to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for ocean dumping permit, enforcement, research, and monitoring activities. Conditions receipt of an ocean dumping permit upon the entering into of a compliance or enforcement agreement with the Administrator which includes a plan for the phasing-out and cessation of ocean dumping and the implementation of alternatives to such dumping. Waives dumping fees charged against persons who have entered into a compliance agreement. Imposes civil monetary penalties against persons who dump sewage sludge or industrial waste into the ocean after 1992. Requires that 90 percent of such penalties be paid into the trust accounts in 1993, with five percent reductions in such allotment for each succeeding year. Pays the remainder to the Administrator for the activities to which dumping fees are devoted. Sets forth reporting requirements. Requires that fees and penalties not needed for use by the Administrator for permit, enforcement, research, and monitoring activities be used for making capitalization grants to New York and New Jersey for the establishment of a revolving fund to assist specified water pollution control efforts under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Directs the Administrator to issue orders requiring ocean dumpers to cease such dumping until they enter into a compliance or enforcement agreement and obtain a permit. Authorizes the Administrator to request the Attorney General to commence civil actions against persons who violate such orders or this Act's ocean dumping provisions.
