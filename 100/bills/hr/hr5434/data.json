Prohibits the export of solid waste except when there is an agreement between the United States and the receiving country which provides for the exchange of information regarding such export and its management, cooperation in the enforcement of the agreement, and biannual review of the agreement's effectiveness. Requires exporters of solid waste to register with and submit specified export and export management information to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who shall annually submit a report to the Congress summarizing such information. Prohibits the export of a solid waste until the Administrator finds that the transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of such export will be carried out in accordance with environmental standards no less strict than Federal standards in this country. Authorizes the Administrator to impose fees on exporters to defray the costs of administering this Act. Imposes criminal penalties against persons who knowingly violate this Act's requirements."
