Provides for the payment of incentive rewards to States to encourage the establishment of programs to pay similar rewards for violations of State laws. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to retire all circulating $100 U.S. notes and issue new $100 U.S. notes. Requires the Secretary to provide for a ten-day exchange period. Requires the name, address, and social security number of any individual who exchanges $100 notes having a value of $5,000 or more to be recorded and forwarded to the Department of the Treasury for use in criminal investigations or prosecutions."
