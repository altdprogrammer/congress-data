    "text": "National Superconductor Manufacturing and Processing Technology Act of 1987 - Establishes a National Superconductor Manufacturing and Processing Technology Initiative (the Initiative), to be implemented by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the National Bureau of Standards. Requires such agencies, with the advice and assistance of a Coordinating Council, to coordinate their efforts to implement the Initiative. Establishes a Superconductivity Manufacturing and Processing Technology Coordinating Council (the Coordinating Council). Directs the Coordinating Council to: (1) serve as a forum for coordination of Federal activities with respect to superconductivity manufacturing and processing technology research and development; (2) work with the agencies charged with implementing the Initiative, and with other Government agencies, private organizations, private industry, and universities, to formulate superconductivity applications research and development priorities, strategies, and agendas; (3) advise the agencies charged with implementing the Initiative with respect to the establishment and management of the superconductivity programs of such agencies; and (4) establish a private sector advisory body, drawn from members of the National Commission on Superconductivity, to comment on the priorities, strategies, agendas, and the Initiative activities. Requires the Coordinating Council, within one year after enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, to submit to the Congress a long-range plan of activities for the Initiative. Requires the agencies implementing the Initiative to: (1) encourage industry (including small business), government, and universities to develop processing, fabrication, manufacturing, and other appropriate technologies for applying and commercializing scientific advances in superconductivity technology; (2) develop team approaches to overcome key technological hurdles, and seek collaborative arrangements of industry and others, such as the National Laboratories, independent research organizations, and universities; (3) use Federal resources and facilities, including the Department of Energy National Laboratories, Engineering Research Centers, and Science and Technology Centers, for designation as superconductivity centers seeking private sector involvement in the form of consortia and collaborative efforts; (4) work closely with the private sector to ensure significant input into the Initiative and that the Initiative is responsive to its needs; (5) provide grants and contracts to individual firms and collaborative team efforts of industry, or of industry in combination with universities and independent research organizations, for superconductivity research; and (6) facilitate Government, academic, and private sector efforts to transfer information on superconductivity science and technology advances made in the United States and in foreign countries. Directs the President to appoint a National Commission on Superconductivity (Commission) to review all major policy issues regarding U.S. applications of recent research advances in superconductors in order to assist the Congress in devising a national strategy to assure U.S. leadership in superconducting technologies. Makes the National Critical Materials Council the coordinating body of the Commission. Requires the Commission, within six months after the enactment of this Act, to report to the President and the Congress with recommendations regarding methods of enhancing the research, development, and implementation of improved superconductor technologies in all major applications. Sets forth the scope of the Commission's review in preparing its report. Disbands the Commission upon submission of its report and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992 for carrying out this Act to: (1) the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; (2) the National Science Foundation; (3) the Department of Energy; and (4) the National Bureau of Standards."
