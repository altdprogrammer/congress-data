Reduces the existing work-related third and sixth preference categories' annual admissions allocations from ten percent to five percent. Directs the Secretary of State to determine and submit to the Congress related per country quotas and selection methods. Prohibits an alien from adjusting to immigrant status on the basis of such additional preference."
