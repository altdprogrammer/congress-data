    "text": "Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1987 - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to direct States to establish binding guidelines for child support award amounts. (Currently, such guidelines need not be binding.) Creates a rebuttable presumption in any judicial or administrative proceeding that the child support award which results from the application of such guidelines is correct. Requires States to review and, if necessary, update such guidelines once every three years and review and update all child support orders at least once every two years to ensure that they continue to comply with child support award guidelines. Requires States to abide by State due process requirements when updating child support awards. Directs States to: (1) determine the paternity of every child within the State whose family receives family support supplements as soon as possible after the child's birth but in no event later than its 18th birthday; and (2) require the parties in a contested paternity case to submit to genetic tests upon the request of a party in such case, using a 95 percent probability index from blood tests as a rebuttable presumption of paternity. Encourages States to establish and implement simple civil processes for voluntarily acknowledging paternity and a civil procedure for establishing paternity in contested cases. Sets performance standards for paternity determinations from FY 1989 through 1993. Alters the formula for determining the incentive payment to be paid to a State for its child support collection efforts to take into account cases in which a child's paternity has been established but support collection has not begun or amounts to less than $100 a month. Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to authorize States to conduct demonstration projects identifying and testing possible solutions to problems arising in connection with visitation by absent parents and child custody. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to assist in financing such projects. Revises provisions for disregarding certain child support payments for purposes of the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) program. Requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish time limits within which a State must respond to requests for assistance in locating absent parents or establishing paternity, and begin proceedings to establish child support awards. Requires States to have an operational automatic data processing and information retrieval system for the child support enforcement and establishment of paternity determination process by October 1, 1992. Repeals a certain reimbursement rate after such date. Excludes the cost of certain interstate child support enforcement projects from the computation of the incentive payment to a State for its child support collection efforts. Lowers the Federal matching rate for part D expenses to 66 percent for States which are not fully in compliance with the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 at any time after the expiration of six months after this Act's enactment. Sets such rate at 70 percent for States which comply with such amendments and have in effect a law providing, with specified exceptions, for the immediate withholding of court-ordered child support from a parent's wages. Establishes a commission to examine the problems of interstate child support enforcement and develop a new model interstate law to facilitate and strengthen such enforcement. Requires such commission to report its findings to the President and the Congress within one year of this Act's enactment. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to conduct a study of the patterns of expenditures on children in two-parent families, in single-parent families following divorce, and in single-parent families in which the parents were never married, giving particular attention to the relative standards-of-living in households in which both parents and all of the children do not live together. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on such study within two years of this Act's enactment. Authorizes appropriations for such study. Requires the Secretary to make grants to States for demonstration projects under which absent parents who owe child support, but whose income is insufficient to pay such support, are encouraged to participate in work, education, and training activities available in the State. Directs the Secretary to collect and maintain up-to-date child support enforcement data. Requires the Secretary of Labor to make the name, social security number, current address, and place of employment of any specified individual available to the Parent Locator Service and State child support enforcement agencies which request such information."
