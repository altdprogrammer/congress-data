    "text": "Nuclear Waste Transportation Act - Prohibits any person from offering high-level radioactive waste for transportation in interstate commerce unless a license to do so has been obtained from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission). Prohibits any person from transporting such waste in interstate commerce unless: (1) an order designating the transportation route for such waste has been received from the Commission; and (2) such radioactive waste has been received from a person licensed by the Commission under this Act. Prescribes the guidelines under which the Commission is authorized to issue licenses to offer high-level radioactive wastes for transportation. Requires the Commission to: (1) provide written notification of such license applications to political subdivisions and Indian tribes through whose territories such waste may be transported; (2) solicit comments from the chief official of such affected areas with regard to the routing of such wastes; (3) issue an order to the transporter designating the transportation route for such waste after considering the information provided by the appropriate chief official; and (4) forward a copy of such order to such official. Requires a licensee under this Act to inform any chief official of the: (1) date of such radioactive waste transportation; and (2) emergency response procedures to be implemented in case of an accident. Requires such information to be furnished at least ten days prior to the transportation date. Authorizes the Commission to determine whether a license under this Act shall be effective for a single shipment or for a series of similar shipments from the same location. Prohibits any license from being effective for more than one year. Subjects violators of this Act to certain civil penalties under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954."
