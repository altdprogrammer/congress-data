Declares that any such activities commenced (or decisions made by the Secretary) before the date of enactment of this Act shall be rescinded or terminated. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from authorizing the construction of more than one repository under such Act. Removes the deadlines by which the Secretary and the President must submit candidate site nominations for second repository site characterizations. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to revise the repository mission plan to reflect the provisions of this Act and to submit such revisions within six months after enactment of this Act. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to prohibit the Secretary from expending funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for any activity relating to a second or subsequent repository. Prohibits the Secretary from nominating any crystalline rock site for site characterization."
