Declares that it is the purpose of this Act to establish a comprehensive national civilian space and aeronautics policy that will provide the framework for a world information system, an orbital civilization, exploration of the solar system, and the development of other space and aeronautical activities in order to preserve and expand the leadership of the United States in the movement of mankind's civilization into space. Title II: National Space and Aeronautics Policy - Declares that the United States is committed to the expansion of the peaceful civilization of the space and atmospheric environments for the benefit of the Nation and all of mankind. Establishes national space and aeronautics principles. Title III: Program - Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in cooperation with appropriate private, governmental, and international groups, to pursue aggressive research and systems development in space and aeronautics science and technology. Includes the following programs among NASA's activities: (1) the creation of an operational world information system by the year 1990; (2) the development of the basic facilities and capabilities by the year 2000 necessary to create an orbital civilization in near-Earth space; (3) the development of the capabilities by the year 2010 to undertake further solar system exploration by mankind; (4) the development of economical and reliable space technology necessary to carry out such programs; (5) the establishment and maintenance of research and application programs; and (6) the establishment and maintenance of aeronautical technology programs. Directs the Administrator of NASA, together with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to develop and submit to the Congress, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, a preliminary 30-day plan, including proposed annual funding requirements and a detailed research and development schedule. Directs the Administrator to submit a final 30-year plan within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires that status reports and revisions to the plan be submitted on an annual basis in conjunction with the submission of the budget request beginning with the third fiscal year enactment of this Act. Provides that, beginning with the third fiscal year after enactment of this Act, the provisions of this Act shall be the general basis for authorizations of funds for NASA, consistent with the provisions of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended."
