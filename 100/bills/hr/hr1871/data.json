Adds family support services to the definition of priority services. Revises the definition of supported employment of persons with developmental disabilities. Allows States, at their discretion, in their plan for the provision of services for persons with developmental disabilities, to provide for more than one priority service or for one or more of a list of optional services. Revises the requirements for membership in State Planning Councils to allow immediate relatives and guardians of previously institutionalized as well as of institutionalized persons with developmental disabilities to serve on the Councils. Amends the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act to create a new part relating to a developmental disabilities status report. Requires that, for each of the FY 1988 through 1990, the State plan for the provision of services for persons with developmental disabilities contain assurances that the State, by September 30, 1990, will submit a comprehensive description of: (1) its eligibility standards for the receipt of services by persons with developmental disabilities; (2) the services provided; (3) the extent to which the State is meeting the needs of such persons; (4) the extent to which the State is carrying out the purpose of this title; (5) the recommendations of the State for meeting the needs of all persons with developmental disabilities; and (6) the views of persons with developmental disabilities and the views of advocates for such persons. Requires the State plan to contain assurances that the State will conduct a study to obtain such views of persons with and advocates for persons with developmental disabilities. Requires the State plan to contain, for FY 1989 and 1990, a statement of progress toward completing such comprehensive description."
