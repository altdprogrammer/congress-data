    "text": "Service Contract Accountability and Procedures Act - Prohibits an agency from renewing any contract to utilize the services of non-Federal personnel to perform functions for the Government unless such renewal is in accordance with this Act. Requires an agency desiring to utilize the service of non-Federal personnel to perform Government functions to prepare a detailed report to justify such action. Requires the report to be filed with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and submitted to the appropriate congressional committees. Prohibits a function which has been determined by an agency to relate directly to the performance of that agency's mission from being performed by non-Federal personnel, unless it has also been determined that such function would not have a negative impact upon the achievement of the agency's mission. Requires an agency, before entering into or renewing a contract to use the services of non-Federal personnel, to study the actual cost of the performance of the function by Federal personnel. Sets forth criteria for conducting such study. Establishes penalties to be imposed upon any person who discloses information contained in a cost of performance study or who uses information in such study to prepare a commercial bid in response to a Government solicitation. Sets forth publication requirements for bids for contracts. Requires such bids to use specifications from the cost of performance study. Provides that if the agency receives only one bid for the performance, then the functions shall continue to be or shall thereafter be performed by Federal personnel. Provides that if there is a lack of competitive commercial source, then a second solicitation for bids based on the original cost of performance study shall not occur for a period of one year and shall not occur until the original cost of performance study has been reviewed and updated. Sets forth provisions to be included in all contracts between an agency and a person under which services of non-Federal personnel will be utilized. Sets forth requirements for contractors who desire to use real or personal property belonging to the Government in performing functions for the Government. Requires Federal employees whose jobs require the performance of functions which become the subject of a contract to be terminated in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, directives, and collective bargaining agreements. Requires the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to report to the Congress annually on service contracts utilizing non-Federal personnel. Directs agencies to develop and implement policies to ensure that contracts for services are administered in a cost-effective manner."
