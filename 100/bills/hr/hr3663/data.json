    "text": "Low-Income Housing Tax Act of 1987 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with respect to gain or loss on dispositions of property to provide that for purposes of determining the allowable depreciation and the amount of gain in connection with qualified low-income housing (as defined in this Act) or its disposition, the adjusted basis shall be increased to equal the adjusted cost of the housing. Provides for the recapture of benefits if the taxpayer fails to operate the housing in accordance with the relevant agreement or if there is a disposition of the property. Revises the IRC to waive the ten-year requirement for the low-income housing credit if: (1) the head of the governmental body responsible for administering the pertinent low-income housing program determines either that the availability of the credit would help to avoid default or mitigate loss to the government involved, or that the availability of the credit is necessary to enable the project to avoid default or to be retained for low-income use; or (2) the taxpayer acquires the building from a governmental body that acquired it by reason of default on any indebtedness. Excludes from the gross income of a noncorporate taxpayer any passive activity gain realized in connection with the disposition of a qualified low-income housing project to a qualified non-related party that agrees to continue the low-income housing use of the property. Requires that the property: (1) be held by the taxpayer for the five years preceding the disposition; and (2) be identified by a State or local government as necessary to meet certain low-income housing requirements. Revises the definition of \"cooperative housing corporation\" for purposes of the income tax deduction of taxes, interest, and business depreciated by a tenant-stockholder to delete the 80-percent income requirement for limited equity cooperative housing corporations. Requires that income derived from investment of the mandatory reserves of a limited equity cooperative housing corporation be treated, for purposes of the tax deduction incurred in transactions with members, as income derived by the corporation from its members. Provides for the recapture of such amounts if the corporation ceases to be a qualified limited equity cooperative housing corporation. Permits such a corporation to elect retroactive application of such treatment."
