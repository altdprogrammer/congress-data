Defines \"forgive\" as: (1) releasing the debtor from the obligation to repay part or all of the loan; (2) providing an interest subsidy to the debtor with respect to the loan; (3) extending the maturity of the loan; or (4) taking any other action which would reduce the total outstanding debt of the debtor. Specifies that the provisions of this Act shall not be construed to authorize the President to reduce any foreign assistance provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, the Arms Export Control Act, or any other law."
