Extends until April 1, 1988, the deadline for a report to the Congress by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs concerning the effectiveness of providing such readjustment counseling to veterans. Extends by one year various other reporting dates required of the Administrator under the readjustment counseling program. Revises certain reporting requirements of the Administrator under such program. Directs the Administrator to maintain in operation until October 1, 1988, the same number of readjustment counseling centers as were in operation on April 1, 1987. Amends the Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1983 to extend until October 1, 1987, the deadline for a report to the Congress by the Administrator on the results of a study of post-traumatic stress disorder and other post-war psychological problems of Vietnam veterans."
