Directs the Secretary of State to use the existing list of qualified immigrants established under such Act. Provides an additional 10,000 visas in each of FY 1990 and 1991 to immigrants from underrepresented countries. Defines \"underrepresented country\" as one whose natives have received less than 25 percent of the maximum immigrant visas available to it in FY 1988 (excluding admissions under the Public Law 89-236 program). Waives labor certification requirements for such immigrants. Directs the Attorney General to extend through December 31, 1989, the H-1 visa status of certain registered nurses who have held such status for at least five years and whose status expires in 1988 or 1989, or expired in 1987 but is under request for administrative extension."
