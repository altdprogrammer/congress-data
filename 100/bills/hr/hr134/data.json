Empowers the Commission to register boxing matches and boxers participating in such matches. Declares that no boxing match may take place unless registered by the Commission. Allows the Commission to prohibit the holding of any proposed boxing match if such prohibition is in the public interest and: (1) any contract, arrangement, or agreement fails to conform to the regulations prescribed by the Commission; (2) the match, or any boxer in the match, is not registered; or (3) there exist reasonable grounds to believe that the match will be affected by violations of fair labor standards in regulations issued by the Commission. Requires the Commission to prescribe regulations pertaining to: (1) fair labor standards applicable to professional boxing; (2) the registration of boxing matches and boxers; (3) the making of contracts, agreements, arrangements, and understandings; and (4) the promotion and conduct of boxing matches. Allows the Commission to undertake investigations to determine whether provisions of this Act have been violated and to bring appropriate action. Sets forth provisions for any person aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission. Allows any person who claims injury by a violation of a provision of this Act to commence a civil action in an appropriate court. Sets forth provisions under which the Commission may secure information and employee services from government agencies and entities. Directs the Commission to consult with appropriate organizations with respect to the international regulation of professional boxing. Requires the Commission to report annually to the Congress. Declares that nothing in this Act shall prohibit any State boxing commission or agency from exercising its powers, except to the extent that such powers are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act."
