Continues to reserve to the United States the minerals and associated rights previously reserved in such property to the United States. Prohibits the Secretary from taking such steps unless and until the county makes a timely submission (within one year after enactment of this Act) to the Secretary of documents demonstrating that: (1) the county has entered into a binding agreement to exchange the county's interest in such lands for other specified land which the Secretary finds suitable for use for public open space and recreation; and (2) the county agrees that such other land shall be used forever for public open space and recreation or it shall revert to the United States. Directs the Secretary to retain any land transferred to, and vested in, the United States under this Act and to manage it for public open space and recreation, unless the Secretary determines that such land is suitable for disposal, pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
