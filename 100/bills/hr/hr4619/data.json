Vests such board with the same powers and responsibilities as are vested in a FERC member. Declares that State members shall sit with FERC en banc at any oral argument or public hearing conference and that State members shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in FERC deliberations when it considers joint board recommendations. Mandates that the joint board be composed of three Commission members and four State commissioners nominated by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and approved by FERC. Declares that the joint board's jurisdiction does not exceed that of FERC."
