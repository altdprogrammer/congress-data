Deletes the requirement that an agent for a foreign principal must include the agent's address in such mailings. Deletes the requirement that agents of foreign principals must include in such mailings notice that their registration statements are available at the Department of Justice. Deletes the provision authorizing the Postmaster General to declare nonmailable certain material which is offered for transmittal in the United States to someone in another American republic if a representative of that republic has informed the Postmaster that such material is illegal in such republic and has requested that its transmittal be stopped. Amends the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 to repeal the provision denying passports to members of communist organizations."
