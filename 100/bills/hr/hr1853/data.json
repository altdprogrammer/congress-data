Subjects such formula to approval by the Secretary. Lists types of information which must be considered when establishing such a formula. Allows a farmer or rancher to be identified as an eligible dislocated worker if: (1) the operation of the farm or ranch will terminate because of one or more listed events (foreclosure, failure to return a profit during the preceding 12 months, bankruptcy proceedings, the inability to obtain necessary capital, the failure to make payments on loans secured by farm premises, or total debts exceeding 70 percent of total farm assets); or (2) the farmer or rancher is determined to leave farming or ranching because of excessive debts. Requires each State to ensure the establishment of a rapid response capability. Requires funds allotted by the Governor under such Act to be allotted among service providers to: (1) establish centers to provide for the comprehensive delivery of authorized services; and (2) insure the delivery such services to dislocated workers. Requires each service provider to submit a biennial plan to the Governor describing its programs, activities, and goals. Expands the authorized activities which may be provided under such Act to include: (1) basic education and occupational skills assessment; (2) literacy skills assessment; (3) basic, remedial and literacy education; and (4) the establishment and maintenance of rapid response capabilities.
