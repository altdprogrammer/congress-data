Provides that when the owner or operator of a farm, upon notice to the Secretary, converts all or any portion of any program crop acreage base to targeted game and wildlife uses, the converted land: (1) shall be counted toward satisfying any acreage reduction program; (2) shall, to the extent it exceeds acreage reduction requirements, be counted toward any paid diversion program; and (3) shall, to the extent it exceeds both acreage reduction and paid diversion requirements, be considered as having been planted in the most recently planted program crop in order to preserve the farms' acreage base and program crop acreage base. Permits resumed program crop production on such wildlife acreage with 120 days' written notice to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to ensure to the extent practicable that such program does not increase crop production or budget outlays."
