    "text": "Cigarette Restrictions Act of 1988 - Declares that consumer sales promotion of tobacco products is an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue regulations defining such unlawful acts or practices. Prohibits the sale of tobacco products unless sold over the counter in an establishment in which is posted a sign stating the sale of cigarettes to minors is strictly prohibited. Repeals provisions of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act exempting cigarettes manufactured, imported, or packaged for export from the requirements of such Act. Requires the FTC to conduct a continuing study of the constituents of tobacco smoke, including: (1) random testing of cigarettes to determine the amounts of tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other constituents; and (2) an analysis of the levels of cigarette smoke constituents when people change their smoking behavior to compensate for lower levels of nicotine. Directs the FTC to: (1) arrange for a laboratory of the Government or a private, non-profit laboratory with no connection to a tobacco company to conduct the study; (2) as a condition to the arrangement, require such laboratory to conduct similar studies for private non-profit groups; and (3) report annually to the Congress on the results. Declares that State tort systems should be allowed to treat cigarettes like any other product even though warning labels are required and States are prohibited from requiring additional warning labels. Provides that States are not prevented from regulating the sales, distribution, or promotion of cigarettes. Requires cigarette packages to bear a warning label stating that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive, with specified format requirements, and in both English and the language of any country in which an exporter reasonably expects the cigarette to be sold. Makes this Act applicable with respect to cigarettes manufactured after one year after the date of the enactment of this Act."
