Declares that each State shall: (1) retain and provide prompt access to such mileage information and vehicle identification number for a five-year period; and (2) reprint the most recent odometer information on duplicate certificates of title. Mandates that upon the transfer of motor vehicle ownership the ensuing title indicate on its face either the vehicle's actual mileage, or the name of the first State to issue a title for such vehicle."
