Sets forth the conditions which must be met, including: that (1) the transferor county, a political subdivision of the State of Utah, establishes and administers an irrevocable trust to satisfy, with respect to such facility, its obligation under Federal laws and regulations to provide for adequate facilities to furnish needed services for persons unable to pay; and (2) the transferee corporation agrees to satisfy the obligation of the county to provide such services for persons unable to pay. Directs the Secretary to make such determination within 12 months after enactment of this Act and to certify the determination to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to monitor compliance and, if conditions are not met or either party fails to carry out its duties, to ensure that proceedings are commenced to recover the amounts as provided by current law."
