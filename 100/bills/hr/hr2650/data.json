    "text": "Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Amendment of 1987 - Title I: General Provisions - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989. Amends the Surface Transportation Act of 1982 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to States and political subdivisions for the designation of: (1) hazardous materials transportation routes; and (2) hazardous materials parking sites. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to require registered carriers of hazardous materials to maintain records of the routes followed in the transportation of certain hazardous materials and to prepare an annual registration statement. Prescribes registration fee guidelines. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (with respect to miscellaneous excise taxes) to finance the Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Response Trust Fund (established by this Act) by raising the excise tax on: (1) gasoline; (2) diesel and special motor fuels; (3) aviation fuels; and (4) fuels used in commercial transportation on inland waterways. Establishes the Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Response Trust Fund in the Treasury. Prescribes operations guidelines for such Fund. Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to direct the Secretary to make grants to the States to assist in the training and assistance equipment needs of emergency personnel responding to hazardous material transportation incidents. Prescribes grant administration and operation guidelines. Authorizes appropriations to fund such grants for FY 1988 through 1992 out of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Emergency Response Trust Fund. Outlines the emergency response information regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary within one year of the date of enactment of this Act. Sets forth minimum training certification requirements for personnel affecting hazardous material transportation safety. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within 270 days after the date of enactment of this Act regarding specified aspects of hazardous materials transportation safety. Directs the Secretary to establish information dissemination procedures regarding enforcement actions pertaining to violations of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. Makes any person who commits a violation of this Act liable to the United States for a civil penalty (currently such violation must be knowingly committed). Establishes a minimum civil penalty of $500 for each such violation. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act requiring the transportation of hazardous materials in intrastate commerce to be covered by the same Federal regulations that pertain to interstate transportation of such materials. Directs the Secretary (in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency) to provide technical and financial assistance regarding hazardous materials transportation safety to State, regional, or local government entities. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct a hazardous materials flow study and to report the results of such study to the Congress; and (2) conduct a risk analysis regarding the transportation of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel to geologic repository sites and monitored retrievable storage sites, and report the results to the Congress and the Secretary of Energy. Title II: Rail Transportation - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations regarding emergency response procedures for rail carriers in accident or emergency situations involving the transportation and storage of hazardous materials. Prescribes the contents of such requirements. Prohibits railroad tank cars built before November 6, 1971, from being used in commercial hazardous materials transportation unless they meet all safety and design requirements imposed by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a study of railroad tank car design, and to report the results of such study to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
