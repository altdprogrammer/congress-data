Directs the Commission to report its findings and recommendations to the Congress by September 30, 1987. Terminates the Commission by December 31, 1987. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Congressional Review and Action on Commission Report - Provides for congressional committee referral and hearings on the Commission's report. Requires the appropriate committee, by December 31, 1987, to report to its House a bill, resolution, or report containing its recommendations with respect to the Commission's report. Sets forth procedures for the privileged consideration of such a bill or resolution in the House of Representatives. Repeals the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 on March 15, 1988, unless legislation has been enacted, following the issuance of such committee report, continuing or modifying such Acts."
