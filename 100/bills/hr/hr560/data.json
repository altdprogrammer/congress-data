    "text": "Highway Safety Act of 1987 - Authorizes appropriations for highway safety programs for FY 1987 through 1990. Rescinds the Secretary's authority to temporarily amend or waive highway safety standards for the purpose of evaluating different highway safety programs. Repeals the requirement that a State highway safety program must provide for driver education in the school system as a prerequisite for Federal approval of such a program. Extends from September 1, 1981, to September 1, 1987, the deadline by which the Secretary is required to begin a rulemaking process to determine the most effective accident-reducing programs. Repeals congressional veto provisions regarding such rules. Alters the make-up of the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee in the Department of Transportation. Amends the National Driver Register Act of 1982 to extend the deadline by which the Secretary is required to: (1) promulgate final rules regarding establishment of the National Driver Register; and (2) begin a pilot test program for an electronic information retrieval system regarding individual motor vehicle driving records; and (3) report to the Congress regarding the Register. Directs the Secretary to: (1) include in his report to the Congress any recommendations concerning the desirability of extending the authorization of appropriations beyond FY 1987; and (2) submit a comprehensive report to the Congress regarding the effectiveness of the National Driver Register System three years after the establishment of a fully electronic Register system. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Prohibits the Secretary from establishing final minimum standards regarding the performance and installation of splash and spray suppression devices on certain trucks until the Secretary has determined that: (1) the available technology can substantially reduce splash and spray and improve visibility; and (2) such technology will protect the public from unreasonable risks. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the standards based upon available technology foster competition among splash and spray suppression device manufacturers."
