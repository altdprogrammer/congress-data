    "text": "Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish a grants program for parental choice open enrollment in public schools. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make such program grants to local educational agencies (LEAs). Prohibits any LEA from being eligible to participate in such program unless it agrees to permit: (1) elementary and secondary school students to enroll in public schools in the school district without regard to school attendance zones; and (2) such students and their families to decide which school the student will attend in that school district. Allows such grants to be used for: (1) increasing school attendance and student achievement; (2) increasing accountability for success of the educational program in schools; (3) increasing parental involvement and public interest in schools; (4) establishing and operating distinctive schools with new and innovative approaches to education, including increasing flexibility and autonomy at the school level; and (5) providing a wider range of choices of educational courses of instruction to educationally and economically disadvantaged children. Requires that at least 50 percent of a grant be used to carry out the parental choice program. Sets forth individual LEA application requirements for such grants. Permits LEA consortia to apply for such grants to develop and conduct interdistrict, regional, or statewide parental choice programs. Limits the amount of each grant, but authorizes the Secretary to waive such limitation in the case of an LEA serving a very large number of students or a consortium of LEAs serving large school districts or in other special circumstances. Limits the duration of such grants to a five-year period. Allows any LEA with a parental choice program in operation during the year for which assistance is sought to apply for a grant to expand such program. Allows any LEA receiving a magnet schools program grant, under the ESEA or the Education for Economic Security Act, to apply for a parental choice program grant if the LEA provides assurances that such funds will be used for additional activities to strengthen the educational program of its schools. Directs the Secretary, by October 1, 1992, to: (1) provide for an independent evaluation of assisted programs to determine the effectiveness of parental choice programs; and (2) report to the Congress on such evaluation results. Requires that such evaluation be made available for all possible dissemination. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 to carry out this Act."
