    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1988-09-14", 
    "text": "Amends Federal-aid highway law to repeal: (1) the requirement that each State certify that it is enforcing all speed limits on public highways in accordance with the national prescribed speed limit of 55 miles per hour; and (2) the prohibition against approval by the Secretary of Transportation of highway projects in any State in which such certification has not been forthcoming. Amends the national speed limit law to prohibit the Secretary from approving Federal aid for a State highway construction project if such State fails to certify that: (1) public highways constructed with Federal-aid highway funds have been designed and constructed according to standards appropriate for the speed permitted on such highways; and (2) that the State has been enforcing speed limits on public roads posted at 55 miles per hour or higher. Requires States to report speed monitoring data on any public highway with speed limits posted at 55 miles per hour or higher. Precludes the Secretary from approving proposed highway project plans and specifications on a Federal-aid system which is to be posted at greater than 55 miles per hour unless such plans provide for a facility constructed for a speed limit equal to or greater than that to be posted upon completion."
