Directs the Postal Service to prescribe rules and regulations permitting the mailing of such plants consistent with procedures relating to the inspection, disinfection, and certification of, and other conditions for, the delivery and shipment of plants otherwise subject to quarantine. Imposes criminal penalties upon: (1) whoever knowingly mails or causes to be mailed a nonmailable plant; or (2) whoever forges or counterfeits agricultural certifications. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Postal Service and the Department of Agriculture should engage in a joint effort to educate the public to the types of harm which can result from the transmission to different parts of the country of plants, fruits, vegetables, and other matter which may be carrying dangerous plant diseases or pests."
