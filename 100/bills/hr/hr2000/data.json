(Currently, such choice must be made simultaneously upon entering service.) Makes the same change for individuals first entering the Selected Reserve. Removes authority to make advance payments of subsistence allowances. Removes a provision allowing a veteran to be paid in advance for certain work to be performed under a work-study program. Redefines \"standard class session\" for purposes of laboratory instruction. Revises provisions concerning compliance surveys conducted by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs of institutions offering courses approved for the instruction of veterans. Title II: Repeal of Education Loan Program; Technical Amendments - Repeals Federal provisions: (1) authorizing a veteran to use any unused educational assistance benefits for eligibility for an education loan; (2) authorizing accelerated (advanced) payment of educational assistance allowances; and (3) authorizing educational loans to any veteran. Title III: Savings Provision - States that loans made and accounts established for the collection of deposits made before the effective date of this Act shall continue in effect until completed."
