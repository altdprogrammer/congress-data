Directs the Board of Trustees of these trust funds to make a thorough study with respect to redirecting amounts that would ordinarily be paid as employment taxes into individual retirement accounts or other retirement income arrangements. Enumerates items to be included in the study. Requires the Board to report its findings to specified congressional leadership within one year of this Act's enactment."
