Authorizes additional funds to be appropriated to the Commission for the purpose of establishing and operating the electronic data gathering, analysis, and retrieval (EDGAR) system. Sets forth requirements for the funding of the establishment and operation of the system. Requires the Commission to submit semiannual reports to specified congressional committees on system development, implementation, progress, and costs. Specifies that only a certain amount of funds appropriated for the EDGAR system for FY 1988 and no FY 1989 funds may be expended unless the Commission has made a certification to specified congressional committees with respect to system costs, benefits, implementation, capabilities, and filing requirements. Requires the Commission to prescribe: (1) restrictions on the sale or dissemination of, and access to, EDGAR system information; and (2) requirements for filings with the Commission in a form suitable for entry into the system and in written form until the system is determined to be effective, efficient, and reliable."
