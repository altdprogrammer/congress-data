Requires any notification to the Congress pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act with respect to the sale of arms to China to be accompanied by a presidential determination that the Government of China is acting in good faith and in a timely manner to resolve human rights issues in Tibet. Requires the Secretary of State to submit a report to the Congress on the human rights situation in Tibet and on the transfer of millions of Chinese to Tibet. Provides financial assistance for Tibetan refugees for FY 1988 and 1989. Provides United States Information Agency scholarships for Tibetan exiles for FY 1988 and 1989."
