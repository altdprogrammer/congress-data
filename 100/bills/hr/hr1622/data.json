Rept. 100-339 (Part II)) Cotton Research and Promotion Program Act of 1987 - Amends the Cotton Research and Promotion Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture, within eight months of enactment of this Act, to conduct a referendum among cotton producers and importers to determine whether the existing cotton marketing order should be changed to: (1) subject imported upland cotton to Cotton Research and Promotion Act marketing assessments; and (2) include importers of such cotton on the Cotton Board. Increases from $200,000 to $300,000 the amount of referendum expenses which may be reimbursed to the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary and the Commissioner of Customs to enter into an agreement under which the U.S. Customs Service would collect import assessments for the Cotton Board."
