Authorizes the Corporation to issue capital stock. Authorizes the Corporation to own and operate an air traffic control system. Outlines the Corporation's powers, including the establishment of nondiscriminatory fees for the provision of air traffic control services. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations for the review and appeal of such fees. Directs the Corporation to notify the Secretary of State whenever it enters into negotiations with a foreign entity with respect to air traffic control matters. Confers jurisdiction upon the Federal district courts for violations of this Act. Requires the Corporation to submit annually a detailed operations report to the President and to the Congress. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to submit annual evaluations to the Congress regarding the Corporation's operations and capital structure.
