    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) California Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1987 - Withdraws from appropriation under the public land laws and reserves for military use by the Secretary of the Navy specified lands in California known as the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in Inyo, Kern, and San Bernardino Counties and Chocolate Mountain in Imperial County. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage such lands' nonmilitary uses, subject to closure by the Secretary of the Navy for security or safety purposes. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop, within three years, a management plan for such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to prevent and suppress brush and range fires with reimbursable assistance from the Bureau of Land Management. Requires the Secretaries to enter into a memorandum of understanding concerning the management plan which includes the provision of fire control assistance upon request. Requires the Secretary of Defense to notify the Secretary of the Interior whenever withdrawn lands are being used for defense-related purposes other than those specified, including the effect of such different use. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to delegate management responsibilities for China Lake to the Secretary of the Navy. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to report annually to the Secretary of the Interior, who shall then report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of natural and cultural resources on such withdrawn lands. Makes the Secretary of the Navy responsible for the management of wild horses and burros on such lands. Terminates land withdrawals under this Act 15 years after this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to publish a draft environmental impact statement on the continued or renewed withdrawal of lands under this Act. Requires such Secretary to hold a public hearing in California before the withdrawal's termination. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to maintain a decontamination program for such lands during their withdrawal. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on such decontamination efforts. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to notify the Secretary of the Interior, at least three years before the termination of the withdrawal, whether an extension is going to be requested and, if not, to what extent such lands are contaminated with hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to decontaminate relinquished lands, but if such decontamination is not practicable or economically feasible, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept such lands. Requires the Secretary of the Navy to then: (1) warn the public of risks of entry; (2) conduct only decontamination activities on such lands after the expiration of the withdrawal; and (3) report to the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress on the status of such lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish the acceptance of withdrawn lands, indicating when such lands will be open and under what conditions. Exempts the United States from liability for injuries or damages resulting from nonmilitary activity on withdrawn lands. Authorizes an extension of the Navy's use of the El Centro Ranges in Imperial County, California, through 1989, subject to resource protection requirements. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to complete land exchanges between the Nature Conservancy and the Bureau of Land Management concerning the Coachella Valley Preserve. Continues the status of the U.S. Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center in the Toiyabe National Forest, California, as both a training center and as part of such Forest, subject to resource protection requirements."
