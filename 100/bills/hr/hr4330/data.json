Directs the Attorney General to provide such persons with notice of hearing rights and counsel in cases of financial need. Requires the release of a detainee unless the Attorney General establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that such person: (1) is a threat to the community or to other people; or (2) would violate certain conditions of release. States that a release may only be made into suitable community sponsorship or placement. Authorizes the use of Department of Justice funds for half-way housing for such purposes. Provides for stay and revocation of release. Requires annual review of an incarcerated detainee's files. Prohibits judicial review of release determinations under this Act."
