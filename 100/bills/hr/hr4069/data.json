    "date": "1988-03-02", 
    "text": "Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations for the safe transportation of hazardous materials in domestic and foreign commerce (including route designations). Cites the area in which Federal regulations preempt State hazardous materials transportation requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations for dispute resolution among the States regarding hazardous materials highway route designations. Permits States to petition for judicial review of the dispute resolution decision. Grants the Secretary discretion to either adopt or reject hazardous materials transportation standards adopted by international bodies according to the Secretary's perception of the public interest. Requires motor carriers of specified hazardous materials (including radioactive materials) to possess a valid safety permit issued by the Secretary authorizing the carrier to engage in such transportation. Cites circumstances under which such permits may be suspended or revoked. Amends the definition of radioactive materials to state that it does not include any material determined by the Secretary to be of such low radioactivity that it does not pose a significant hazard when transported. Revises the scope of civil penalties to impose liability for any infraction of regulations (currently such liability only attaches to violations knowingly committed). Prescribes guidelines under which the preemption of State laws conflicting with this Act shall be determined. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1989."
