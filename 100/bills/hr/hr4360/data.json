Prohibits the United States from paying contractor attorney fee costs incurred in connection with violation proceedings not resulting in adverse actions, in excess of $75 per hour, unless the contracting officer, the agency board of contract appeals, or the person or body representing the agency involved finds that a special factor justifies an award of higher fees."
