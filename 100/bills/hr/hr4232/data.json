    "text": "Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act - Sets forth a minimum domestic content ratio for vehicle manufacturers producing over 100,000 motor vehicles for sale in the United States during each model year beginning after January 1, 1984. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe rules for allocating automotive products among vehicle manufacturers in certain circumstances. Requires such manufacturers to maintain and furnish records and information required by the Secretary for allocation purposes. Requires the Secretary to make annual reports available to the public regarding the domestic content ratio achieved by each manufacturer during the model year. Declares it is unlawful for a vehicle manufacturer to fail to meet the minimum domestic content ratio for any model year. Sets forth enforcement provisions. Requires the Secretary and the Federal Trade Commission to report to the Congress within one year after enactment of this Act regarding the practices used by vehicle manufacturers to persuade U.S. motor vehicle dealers to favor foreign-made parts over domestically produced parts."
