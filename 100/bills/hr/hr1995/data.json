Outlines the criteria for such assistance. Mandates that such assistance be in the form of grants-in-aid. Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year in the ten-fiscal-year period which begins after the date of enactment of this Act. Presents guidelines under which clean coal technologies are subject to regulatory treatment. Directs the Secretary (and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency) to: (1) consult and coordinate designated clean coal technologies with State authorities; and (2) prescribe regulations implementing this Act within six months after its date of enactment."
