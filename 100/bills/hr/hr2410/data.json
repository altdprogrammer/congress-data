    "text": "Diplomatic Reciprocity and Security Act - Title I: Soviet Embassy in the United States and United States Embassy in the Soviet Union - Declares that the United States withdraws from the agreement with the Soviet Union concerning embassies in Moscow and Washington. Authorizes the President to waive such withdrawal if he determines, and reports to the Congress, that: (1) it is vital to the national security of the United States not to withdraw from the embassy agreement; (2) the U.S. Embassy in Moscow can be safely and securely occupied by the United States and used for its intended purposes; and (3) steps have been or will be taken to eliminate, no later than October 1, 1989, the damage to U.S. national security due to electronic surveillance from Soviet facilities at the Mount Alto site in Washington, D.C., and from other Soviet facilities in the United States. Provides that if the withdrawal from the embassy agreement takes effect the Mount Alto site may not be available for use by a foreign mission for any purpose. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the current arbitration process between the United States and the Soviet Union should be expanded to include Soviet reimbursement of the full costs incurred by the United States as a result of the intelligence activities of the Soviet Union directed at the new United States Embassy in Moscow. Requires the Secretary of State to achieve, by October 1, 1989, reciprocity in certain matters for U.S. diplomatic and consular posts in the Soviet Union.
