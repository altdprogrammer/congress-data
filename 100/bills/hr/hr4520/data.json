    "text": "Shellfish Indicator Research Act - Directs the Chief Scientist of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to establish a shellfish indicator research program, including: (1) an environmental assessment of U.S. commercial shellfish growing areas, including the relationships between sewage contamination and human enteric pathogens; (2) an evaluation of such relationships to potential risks to public health; (3) a comparison of current microbiological and new technological methods; (4) design of epidemiological methodology regarding actual risks to human health; and (5) recommendations for improving the capabilities of Federal and State sanitation regulatory agencies to effectively manage and regulate shellfish resources. Requires the program to evaluate representative estuaries and make recommendations pertaining to shellfish management for specified shellfish growing regions. Directs the Chief Scientist to make grants to carry out the program according to a specified timetable. Sets forth the factors the Chief Scientist must consider in deciding whether to award assistance. Directs the Chief Scientist to consult with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and appropriate State agencies and industry representatives with respect to the identification of research objectives and in preparing reports to the Congress required by this Act. Directs the Chief Scientist to undertake a biennial review of the program. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1992."
