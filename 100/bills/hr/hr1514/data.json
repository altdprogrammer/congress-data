Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include as \"unreasonable\" any act, policy, or practice which denies fair and equitable market opportunities through: (1) the failure to grant import licenses for competitively priced products or commodities; and (2) the operation of a State trading enterprise or government procurement policy as an import-restricting device. Requires the USTR to request proceedings under formal dispute settlement procedures under a trade agreement subject to investigation only if considered appropriate in cases involving agricultural products."
