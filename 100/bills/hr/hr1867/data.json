Provides criminal penalties for the unauthorized receipt and use of such information. Empowers the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) determine which of the information required to be gathered, analyzed, and distributed by the Department might influence currency exchange rates, interest rates, or the market value of any commodity, future, option, or security; (2) establish a time schedule and method for public release of such information; and (3) make rules and regulations to carry out such responsibilities."
