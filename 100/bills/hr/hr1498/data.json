Requires any lessor who receives notification of a defective motor vehicle part pertaining to any leased motor vehicle to send a copy of such notice to the lessee. Provides that a dealer may sell or lease a motor vehicle (or motor vehicle item) for which a defect notice has been received only if: (1) the defect or failure to comply has been remedied before delivery under sale or lease; or (2) an enforcement order has been set aside or restrained."
