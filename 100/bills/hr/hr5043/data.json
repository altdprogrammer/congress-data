Prohibits former senior employees of a Senator or Representative, within one year after that employment terminates, from representing others before or attempting to influence any of the following persons in connection with any matter pending before the Congress or any matter on which such former employee seeks action by the Congress or by a Member in the Member's official capacity: (1) the Member of whom that person was an employee; or (2) any employee of such Member.
