Prohibits requiring, as a precondition to receiving such a Medicare hearing with respect to a claim for not less than $500 under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance for Aged and Disabled) of the Act, participation in a hearing under provisions relating to use of carriers for administration of benefits. Directs the Comptroller General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to conduct a study of the feasibility of conducting such Medicare hearings on other than an in-person basis before administrative law judges of the Social Security Administration."
