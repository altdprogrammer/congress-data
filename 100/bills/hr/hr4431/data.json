Makes the forfeiture procedures of the Controlled Substances Act applicable to forfeitures under this Act. Permits courts to order the forfeiture of substitute assets if the property subject to forfeiture under this Act: (1) cannot be located; (2) has been transferred to a third party; (3) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court; (4) has been substantially diminished in value; or (5) has been commingled with other property. Sets forth procedures for the seizure of property subject to forfeiture. Sets forth procedures and rules for the disposition of forfeited property (first making due provision for the rights of any innocent persons). Permits certain funds deposited into the Postal Service Fund (from civil administrative forfeitures conducted by the Postal Service under the Federal criminal code) to be withdrawn and paid into the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund according to guidelines established by the Postal Service."
