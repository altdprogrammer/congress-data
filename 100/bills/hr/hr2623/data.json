Extends from September 30, 1987, to September 30, 1989, the authority of the President to waive the limitations respecting nuclear transfers with respect to Pakistan. Provides that any such waiver shall cease to be effective if the President certifies to the Congress that India has formally accepted the application of reliable safeguards to all its nuclear materials. Provides that if the President certifies to the Congress (at the same time or subsequently) that Pakistan has also formally accepted the application of reliable safeguards then such acceptance shall be deemed to constitute reliable assurances (for purposes of the limitations on nuclear transfers) that Pakistan will not acquire or develop nuclear weapons or assist other nations in doing so. Limits military assistance to Pakistan for FY 1988 through 1993 to 50 percent of the aggregate amount of military assistance for Pakistan which the President requested for FY 1988 unless the President certifies to the Congress that Pakistan has provided reliable and verifiable assurances that it will not produce weapons-grade special nuclear material."
