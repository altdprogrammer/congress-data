Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect any claim of an Indian tribe or individual arising from such Acts. Declares this Act to have been effective on January 1, 1951, for the purpose of Federal payments made to the Macy, Walthill, and Winnebago school districts in Thurston County, Nebraska, because of the existence of non-taxable Indian lands located within such school districts. Amends the White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act of 1985 to extend to March 12, 1989 (currently, March 12, 1988) the deadline for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to compile the second list of individuals who have claims to the settlement agreement under such Act."
