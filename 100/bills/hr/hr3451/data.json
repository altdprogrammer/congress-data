Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and distribute to each provider a standard form concerning rights of coverage and appeal and practical steps required for initiating appeals. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the standard document is made available to any individual covered: (1) at the time the individual begins to receive home health, post-hospital extended care, or extended care services; and (2) whenever a fiscal intermediary makes an appealable determination regarding such services."
