Rept. 100-908 (Part I)) State Fish and Wildlife Assistance Act - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands to require 50 percent of lease revenues under such Act to be deposited into a State Fish and Wildlife Assistance Fund established in the Treasury. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to make annual payments from such Fund to States for game and nongame fish and wildlife programs. Allocates monies to the States according to the relative percentage of State lands constituting leased Federal lands and the relative percentage of a State's population constituting paid hunting and fishing license holders. Requires States to report annually to the Secretary on projects undertaken using such payments. Requires that 50 percent of mineral receipts collected from leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska be deposited into such Fund. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the effect of establishing and expanding units of the National Park System in Alaska where sport hunting is prohibited for registered hunting guides."
