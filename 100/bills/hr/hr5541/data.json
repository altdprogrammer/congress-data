    "text": "Supreme Court of the District of Columbia Establishment Act - Amends the District of Columbia Code to establish the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (Court) consisting of a chief justice and four associate justices with jurisdiction over appeals from final orders and judgments of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that meet specified criteria. Allows the Court, at its discretion, to certify a case for review before it has been determined by the D.C. Court of Appeals, but only under limited circumstances described in this Act. Allows the Court to answer questions of law certified to it by the U.S. Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals of the United States, or the highest court of any State, if a question of D.C. law may be determinative of the cause pending in the certifying court. Requires the Court to conduct business in accordance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure unless it elects to modify such rules. Directs the chief justice of the Court to annually summon the active judges of the D.C. courts to a Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia for the purpose of advising as to means of improving the administration of justice within the District of Columbia. Allows the chief justice to temporarily assign justices to and from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and the Court when necessary. Sets out procedures to govern the transition period. Establishes a transition committee for the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the District of Columbia Code and the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act. Sets forth qualifications and appointment procedures for justices and judges of a D.C. court. Describes administrative features of the new court."
