Exempts law enforcement agencies from liability for removing substances from illegal drug laboratories, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct by such agencies. Subjects suppliers of chemicals to illegal drug laboratories to liability for damages and clean up costs caused by such chemicals, unless the supplier took reasonable steps to ensure that the chemicals were not being put to illegal use. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require the use of forfeiture proceeds for demonstration projects cleaning up hazardous substances associated with illegal drug laboratories."
