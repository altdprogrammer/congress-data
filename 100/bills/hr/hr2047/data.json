Requires the Administrator to issue standards providing for the protection of the health and safety of the public from radioactive emissions resulting from activities carried out at nuclear facilities of the Department of Energy (DOE). Grants the Administrator necessary powers to issue such standards, including the authority to inspect current DOE nuclear facilities and to issue subpoenas commanding the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Authorizes the appropriate district court to enforce such subpoena power. Authorizes the Administrator to suspend operations at any DOE nuclear facility if the health and safety of the public are not reasonably protected. Authorizes the Administrator to order construction of a new DOE nuclear facility suspended if such construction is not being carried out in accordance with applicable standards issued under this Act. Directs the Administrator to notify the Secretary of Energy of any suspensions of construction or operation of a DOE nuclear facility. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress after any such suspension is ordered, giving the reasons for such order. Directs the Administrator, not less than once every three months, to report to the Congress describing the extent to which DOE nuclear facilities are complying with applicable standards issued in accordance with this Act. Directs the Administrator, no later than January 31 of each year, to report to the Congress an estimate of the budget authority required by the Secretary of Energy to comply with applicable standards issued under this Act. Provides certain administrative authority to the Administrator. Provides for protection against conflicts of interest of any supervisory employee of the Agency. Authorizes the Administrator to delegate certain duties, and to procure experts and consultants in order to carry out the purposes of this Act.
