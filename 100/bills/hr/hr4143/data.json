Describes such lands. Provides that the establishment of the Grand Ronde reservation shall not grant or restore any hunting, fishing, or trapping rights beyond those designated in a specified court decree. Directs the State of Oregon to exercise criminal and civil jurisdiction over the reservation. Provides that specified Indian lands in Oregon will be treated as revested Oregon and California railroad grant lands. Requires that all moneys received from those lands be deposited in the Treasury in the Oregon and California land-grant fund, except for receipts from timber removed from such lands before enactment of this Act. Declares that the memorandum of agreement between the Confederated Tribes and the Department of the Interior, relating to the disposition of timber resources on the reservation and the use of funds for economic development, shall apply over a 20-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act. Incorporates such agreement into this Act. Directs the Confederated Tribes to maintain a separate account dedicated to economic development and to deposit into such account 30 percent of the income from tribal timber resources received into the Tribes' Federal trust funds account."
