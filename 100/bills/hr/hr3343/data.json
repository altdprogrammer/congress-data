    "as": "Reported to House amended", 
    "date": "1988-09-23", 
    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Energy and Commerce with amendment, H. Rept. 100-962) Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1988 - Title I: Amendments to Acts - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission: (1) to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in cases where there is a significant risk of injury associated with a product and where a consumer product safety rule (rule) would reduce such risk; and (2) within a specified period, to publish a proposed rule or terminate the proceeding if it is not reasonably necessary to reduce risk or not in the public interest. Directs the Commission, within one year after enactment of this Act, to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of requiring each manufacturer of a product subject to the rule to pay an amount to defray the cost of promulgating such rule. Permits the Commission to rely only upon voluntary consumer product safety standards which are in existence and issued after consideration of the views of interested parties, including consumers and consumer organizations. Requires the Commission to monitor compliance with such standards. Allows interested parties to petition the Commission to issue a rule or amendment to reduce the risk of injury associated with a product. Directs the Commission to grant or deny the petition within 120 days. Authorizes the petitioner to commence a civil action in U.S. district court to compel the Commission to initiate the rulemaking proceeding if the Commission denies the petition or fails to grant or deny such petition within 120 days. Directs the court to order the Commission to initiate the rulemaking if the petitioner shows, by a preponderance of evidence in a de novo proceeding, that the product presents an unreasonable risk of injury and that the Commission's failure to initiate a rulemaking proceeding unreasonably exposes consumers to a risk of injury by the product. Authorizes the court to award court costs in such an action. Provides that the Chairman of the Commission shall be selected by its members and shall serve a two-year term. Terminates the term of office of the current chairman 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act but allows such individual to continue to serve as a Commission member until the expiration of the member's term. Makes a Commission member whose term will expire before the expiration of the two-year term of the Chairman ineligible to be selected as Chairman. Requires the President to consider individuals with experience in the safety of consumer products or related fields in making Commission appointments. Provides that if the Commission consists of only three members, two members of the Commission will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Creates a new position of Director of Compliance, to be filled only by an attorney. Prohibits individuals from serving in specified directorships on an acting basis for a period longer than 90 days. Requires the Commission to employ on a permanent basis no fewer than the full-time equivalent of 525 officers and employees, subject to the availability of appropriations. Exempts from public disclosure restrictions information not developed by the Commission and on which the Commission has included a disclaimer regarding the accuracy of the information. Deletes provisions governing the bringing of a civil action by the manufacturer or private labeler who is notified that the Commission plans to disclose a document claimed by such party to be inaccurate. Authorizes any State attorney general and any other official charged with enforcing State consumer product safety laws to bring a civil action for violations of rules or orders issued under the Consumer Product Safety Act, to petition the Commission to hold public hearings or conduct investigations to determine whether a product presents a substantial hazard, and to appeal Commission decisions. Amends the Federal Hazardous Substances Act to authorize any State attorney general and any other official charged with enforcing state consumer product safety laws to bring a civil action for violations of the Act. Authorizes such officials to petition the Commission to: (1) require notification of the public of banned hazardous substances; (2) order the manufacturer to repair or replace an article which constitutes a banned hazardous substance; and (3) require notification of the public of substances intended for use by children that are not banned but which contain a defect which creates a substantial risk of injury to children. Prohibits the Commission from comparing the costs and benefits of reducing or eliminating risks to the public in determining: (1) whether a substantial product hazard exists; (2) whether a toy or other article intended for use by children complies with the Act's labeling requirement; and (3) whether an action taken is in the public interest. Precludes the district court from making such a comparison in determining whether to declare a product to be imminently hazardous. Sets civil penalties for knowing violations of such Act. Provides for the setting of an agenda and priorities for Commission action each year, following a public hearing and a reasonable opportunity for the submission of comments.

Defines amusement ride, and defines amusement ride operator as the owner of such a ride. Includes amusement ride operators under provisions relating to public disclosure of information. Requires operators of amusement rides which are permanently fixed to a site, upon obtaining information indicating that a serious injury occurred during operation, to notify the Commission immediately with a complete description of the occurrence, unless the operator has actual knowledge that the Commission has been adequately informed of such occurrence. Authorizes the Commission to order the operator to cease operating the ride until it is repaired so that it no longer presents a substantial product hazard, if it is determined that a ride which has been involved in a serious injury or is mechanically identical to a ride so involved presents a substantial product hazard. Requires the Commission to afford on opportunity for a hearing to interested persons, including consumers and consumer organizations, before making such a determination. Requires such orders to specify the hazard presented. Allows the operator to resume operation as soon as the ride is repaired so that it no longer presents such a hazard.
