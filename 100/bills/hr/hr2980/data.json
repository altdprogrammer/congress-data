    "text": "Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations regarding: (1) the mandatory equipment of all trains with event recorders; (2) the mandatory licensing of train engineers and dispatchers; (3) the proscription against the willful tampering of monitoring devices (establishes a civil penalty for railroads operating a track with tampered with or disabled monitoring devices); (4) signal systems at railroad highway grade crossings; and (5) the protection of railroad employees while operating or riding on motor vehicles in the course of employment. Prohibits the Secretary from disclosing the name of any railroad employee who has provided information regarding alleged violations of Federal railroad safety laws or regulations. Sets forth guidelines for the commencement of a civil action by rail carrier employees (or their representatives) against the Secretary for failure to enforce non-discretionary Federal railroad safety laws. Authorizes a railroad employee whose error is alleged in an accident report to have caused a railroad accident to attach an explanatory statement to such report. Directs the Office of Technology Assessment to report to the Congress regarding the financing and installation of automatic train control devices."
