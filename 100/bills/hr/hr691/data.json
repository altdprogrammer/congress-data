    "text": "Employee Drug Testing Protection Act - Prohibits any employer (including the Federal Government) from requiring an employee to undergo a drug test unless: (1) the employer has a reasonable suspicion that the employee uses a controlled substance or designer drug; (2) the employee is or will be engaged in a drug-sensitive occupation; or (3) the employer may do so under a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee. Prohibits an employer from disclosing positive test results before the employee undergoes a confirmatory drug test whose results are also positive. Requires the Secretary of Labor to prepare and distribute notices of the prohibitions against drug testing and to prescribe regulations as necessary to carry out this Act. Sets forth the duties of employers with respect to: (1) notifying employees of protections afforded by this Act; (2) preparing drug test reports; and (3) maintaining, correcting, and disclosing such reports. Sets forth the enforcement powers of the Secretary. Authorizes employees aggrieved by a violation of this Act to obtain relief from the U.S. district courts. Declares that this Act does not apply to members of the armed forces."
