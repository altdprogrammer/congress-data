    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt from the gasoline excise tax any sale of gasoline to a State or local government (or to a purchaser for resale to such government) for its exclusive use. Prohibits imposition of the excise tax on the sale of diesel or aviation fuel to any purchaser (or purchaser for resale to a second purchaser) for use on a farm for farming purposes. (Although fuel sold for these purposes is tax-exempt under current law, provisions of the Revenue Act of 1987 require purchasers to pay the tax and subsequently apply for a refund based on nontaxable uses of the fuel.) Prohibits imposition of the excise tax on the sale of diesel fuel to any purchaser (or purchaser for resale to a second purchaser) for use in the drilling of an oil or gas well."
