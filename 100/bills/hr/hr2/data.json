Permits the use of convict labor and convict-produced materials in highway construction on Federal-aid system: (1) if such convicts are on supervised release; or (2) if the materials are produced by convicts in a qualified prison facility, but the amount of materials produced in any 12-month period does not exceed the amount previously produced in such facility during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987. Amends Federal law relating to construction by States in advance of apportionment to authorize the Secretary to pay the Federal share of a State's highway construction costs when a State: (1) has obligated all highway substitute, urban, secondary, or bridge funds apportioned or allocated to it; (2) has used or demonstrated that it will use the obligation authority allocated to it; and (3) proceeds to construct a highway substitute, urban, secondary, or bridge project without the aid of Federal funds; or (4) proceeds to construct any project on the Federal-aid primary system including the Interstate System without the aid of Federal funds. Provides that the Federal share of a State's construction costs shall include the interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State only to the extent that the bond proceeds have been expended in the construction of such projects on the Interstate System. (Currently, such Federal share provision applies to any State highway Federal aid project.) Prohibits the Secretary from approving applications for the Federal share of construction costs if the amount of approved applications in the category of funds involved exceeds certain apportionments for the applicant State. Extends the use of advance construction to Metropolitan planning projects, planning and research projects, hazard elimination projects, and projects for the elimination of hazards at railroad-highway projects crossings.

Revises Federal law authorizing the Secretary to approve a project on a toll road pursuant to such apportionment transfers if an agreement has been reached with the affected State highway department (and each public authority with jurisdiction over such toll road) that the road will become free to the public upon the collection of tolls sufficient to liquidate the toll road costs and outstanding bonds (as well as maintenance, operation, and debt service costs during the toll collections period).
