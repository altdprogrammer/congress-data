Defines \"child development model\" to mean, with respect to child care services, an entity capable of providing training and on-going assistance to satellites that provide child care services to such children or exceptional children, and which is either: (1) a child care development center that provides child care services at a single site (or at multiple sites in reasonably close proximity) to infants, toddlers, preschool children, and school-age children; or (2) a high quality child care program capable of recruiting, training, supporting, and monitoring family child care providers. Sets forth grant application and program requirements. Sets forth evaluation and reporting requirements for grant recipients. Directs the Secretary to report by April 1, 1991, to the Congress on such program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 to carry out this Act."
