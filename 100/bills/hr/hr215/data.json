Directs the Administrator to provide a medical examination to each such employee serving no less than 90 days in Vietnam, in order to determine any adverse health effects by reason of exposure to phenoxy herbicides (including Agent Orange) or other herbicides. Allows any such individual eligible for such a medical examination to be treated as a veteran for purposes of eligibility for readjustment counseling. Requires the Administrator to notify all those individuals eligible for medical examinations. Directs the Administrator, within 360 days after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on the question of whether such individuals should be treated as veterans for the purpose of benefits, services, and assistance required as a result of disabilities incurred as the result of such service."
