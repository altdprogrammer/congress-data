Sets out eligibility requirements. Limits the number of grants to eight each fiscal year, half of which must be made to businesses in metropolitan areas having populations of at least 500,000. Directs the Administrator to present an evaluation of the grant projects to specified congressional committees no later than March 31, 1992. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Tax Incentives for Small Businesses - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit small businesses a ten percent investment tax credit in connection with certain depreciable property used as part of an on-site child care facility owned and operated by the employer for the care of enrollees, at least 50 percent of whom must be dependents of the employer's employees. Provides for recapture of the credit amount if the facility ceases to be a qualified child care center. Limits eligibility for the credit to small businesses having average annual gross receipts of $5,000,000 or less for the preceding three-year period. Permits the same small businesses a ten percent tax credit for expenses paid or incurred to operate such a facility. Title III: National Advisory Commission on Public and Private Cooperative Child Care Efforts - Establishes the National Advisory Commission on Public and Private Cooperative Child Care Efforts to study and report to specified congressional committees and to persons appointing Commission members concerning ways to promote coordination between Federal programs and American businesses in providing quality child care to working parents. Terminates the Commission 30 days following the submission of its required report. Authorizes appropriations."
