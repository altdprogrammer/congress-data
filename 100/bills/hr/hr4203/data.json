States that such terms do not include any operation of an entity which is controlled by a religious organization. States that nothing in such Act shall be construed to: (1) require or prohibit any person or entity to provide or pay for an abortion; or (2) permit a penalty to be imposed upon any person who is seeking or has had a legal abortion. Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to define the phrase \"program or activity\" to mean all of the activities of the aforementioned entities. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to extend the application of such Acts to: (1) ultimate beneficiaries of Federal financial assistance excluded from coverage before the enactment of this Act; (2) any part of a church or synagogue, if such part does not receive Federal financial assistance; (3) any grocery store, supermarket, or other similar business entity based upon participation in the Federal Food Stamp Program; or (4) any farm, farmer, ranch, or rancher based upon participation in any Federal agricultural program. States that this Act does not require any individual or hospital, or other institution, program, or activity that receives Federal financial assistance to perform or pay for an abortion. Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to provide that the anti-discrimination provisions relating to employment shall not apply to individuals having a contagious disease or infection who, by reason of such disease or infection: (1) would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of others; or (2) are unable to perform the duties of the job."
