Removes the restriction of current law which limits to developing countries the provision of setting aside surplus Government vessels for use in humanitarian services. Extends to October 22, 1989, the termination date relating to setting aside such surplus Government vessels. Extends to November 15, 1987 (currently, October 15, 1987), the moratorium period on the documentation of foreign-built fish processing vessels."
