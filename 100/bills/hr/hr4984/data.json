Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, on request of a foreign government, to assign members of: (1) the Development Corps to serve in the country to assist the country in meeting the long-term basic health care needs of its people; and (2) the Emergency Corps to provide short-term assistance in the country with regard to an ongoing medical emergency. Directs the Secretary to disseminate information on the Health Corps and request health care professionals to provide services to the Corps without compensation. Requires a health care professional to be considered, while providing uncompensated services to the Health Corps, an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of provisions relating to defense of certain malpractice and negligence suits. Directs the Secretary to establish programs in which health professionals and health professions students agree to: (1) serve as members of the Development Corps for at least two years in return for payment by the Federal Government of not more than $20,000 of their educational loans for each year of service; or (2) provide uncompensated services to the Development Corps for at least six months in return for payment by the Federal Government of not more than $5,000 of their educational loans for each six months of service, subject to an aggregate limit. Makes provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, except as inconsistent, apply to these programs. Provides for non-duplication and coordination between these programs and the programs of other Federal agencies, other developed countries, and nonprofit private entities. Directs the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary on policies concerning the activities of the Health Corps. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991."
