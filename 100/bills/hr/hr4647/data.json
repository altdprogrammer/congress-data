    "text": "Title I: National Commission on Natural Resources Disasters - Establishes a National Commission on the 1987 Natural Resources Disaster to study the effects of the fires in western and southeastern States and make recommendations concerning a smooth transition from the loss of natural resources. Directs the Commission to study the effects of the fires on: (1) the economic stability of the affected communities; (2) the availability of sufficient timber supplies to meet future industry needs; (3) fish and wildlife habitats; (4) recreation in the affected areas; (5) the ecosystems in the areas; and (6) management plans of the affected National Forest System lands. Requires a report to the Secretary of Agriculture by December 1, 1989. Authorizes the Commission to accept contributions of money and services in carrying out its duties. Authorizes the Secretary, if contributions are insufficient, to transfer to the Commission funds available from the general fund of the Treasury. Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of its report to the Secretary. Title II: Forest Fire Fighting Planning and Cooperation - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report to the Congress on the rehabilitation needs of each national forest resulting from forest fire damage during the previous year. Requires the Secretary to offer training programs annually to certify volunteers for suppressing forest fires on National Forest System lands. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the local fire emergency mobilization plans for fire fighting equipment in each area of the National Forest System which is prone to forest fires. Amends Federal law authorizing reciprocal fire protection agreements between U.S. agencies and other fire fighting organizations by deleting proximity restrictions on the use and reimbursement of foreign firefighting organizations for fighting wildfires throughout the United States. Requires the agency head to determine that no U.S. firefighting organization is reasonably available to provide such protection before funds are expended for foreign fire protection."
