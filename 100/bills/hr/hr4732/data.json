(Deems a toy a replica of a gun if it is substantially similar to the shape and size of a gun manufactured after 1898.) Makes such ban effective on the earlier of: (1) the expiration of 180 days after enactment of this Act; or (2) the effective date of Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations to implement such ban. Directs the Commission, in developing such regulations, to establish a task force on toy gun safety. Requires such task force to include representatives of law enforcement agencies, toy manufacturers, and consumer organizations."
