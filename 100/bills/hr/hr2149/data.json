Authorizes the city to refund certain outstanding revenue bonds which had been originally issued to pay for the bridge reconstruction costs. Confers rights upon the city of Chester to acquire land from certain sources for such bridge reconstruction and maintenance purposes. Authorizes the city to establish bridge tolls sufficient to cover certain bridge-related expenses, including a sinking fund to amortize bridge-related costs over a specified period. Provides for toll-free bridge operation after provision of the sinking fund. Mandates that a public record of bridge-related costs be available for all interested persons."
