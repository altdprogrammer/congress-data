Sets forth requirements with respect to the use of funds for: (1) specified health care technology assessment activities provisions; and (2) the Council on Health Care Technology. Directs the Secretary, in carrying out provisions relating to research, evaluations, and demonstrations in health statistics, health services, and health care technology assessment, to undertake and support research, evaluation, and demonstration projects respecting the delivery of health care services in rural areas. Authorizes such projects to include, and requires them to be coordinated with, activities authorized by the Social Security Act and the Social Security Amendments of 1967. Revises the duties and composition of the National Advisory Council on Health Care Technology Assessment. Prohibits making certain health services, statistics, research, and demonstration grants and contracts unless they have been submitted to and recommended for approval by a peer review group. (Current law requires submission to a panel of experts.) Revises the amount of non-Federal contributions required for grants relating to the Council on Health Care Technology for FY 1988. Prohibits the Secretary, in carrying out provisions relating to the National Center for Health Services Research, from altering the administrative relationship between the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Director of the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment, as in effect during FY 1986."
