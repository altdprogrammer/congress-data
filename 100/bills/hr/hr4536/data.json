Directs the Secretary to offer cost-sharing program incentives. Provides for Federal-State cost sharing. Limits program participation to producers who have participated in farm programs in two of the three crop years prior to program enrollment. Limits program acreage to not more than 50 percent of a producer's set-aside acreage, and authorizes the enrollment of up to 50 percent of paid land diversion acreage in the program. Requires the program to be carried out through the Commodity Credit Corporation."
