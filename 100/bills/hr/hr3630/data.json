Directs the Commission to study the effects of the fires on: (1) the economic stability of the affected communities; (2) the availability of sufficient timber supplies to meet future industry needs; (3) fish and wildlife habitats; (4) recreation in the affected areas; (5) the ecosystems in the areas; and (6) management plans of the affected National Forest System lands. Requires a report to the Secretary of Agriculture by December 1, 1988. Authorizes the Commission to accept contributions of money and services in carrying out its duties. Authorizes the Secretary, if contributions are insufficient, to transfer to the Commission funds available to the Commodity Credit Corporation. Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of its report to the Secretary."
