Limits the aggregate amount of assistance that may be loaned or granted. Prohibits the Secretary from providing such training program assistance unless such program meets specified standards. Permits the Secretary to exempt any training program from such prohibition if the Secretary considers such program to contain innovative training methods that merit testing. Limits monies available for such innovative programs. Establishes in the Treasury the Supplemental Training Fund to provide assistance under this Act."
