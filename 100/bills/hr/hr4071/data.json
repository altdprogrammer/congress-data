Revises the definition of \"employer\" to include: (1) the Department of Energy; and (2) a contractor operating a Department of Energy facility. Extends from 30 days to one year the time period for filing an employee reprisal complaint. Provides that the remedies available to a complainant under other laws are not preempted by the remedies available under this Act. Requires the prominent posting of the provisions of this Act in any place of employment to which it applies. Authorizes the appropriate authorities to grant injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and exemplary damages. Sets forth sanctions for frivolous complaints."
