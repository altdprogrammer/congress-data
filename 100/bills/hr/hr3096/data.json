Directs the Commission to study: (1) opportunities in the Federal Government for young people (age 17 to 24) to perform voluntary public service; and (2) the effect on Federal employees of improving the quality and expanding the number of such opportunities. Directs the Commission to include in such study an assessment of specified factors, including the desirability and feasibility of assigning some of such volunteers to State and local projects. Requires the Commission to consult with young people and representatives of groups most likely to be adversely affected by improving and increasing such opportunities. Requires the Commission to report, with recommendations, on such study. Directs the Commission, within one year after its first meeting, to transmit its report to the President and specified congressional officers. Terminates the Commission 60 days after submission of its report."
