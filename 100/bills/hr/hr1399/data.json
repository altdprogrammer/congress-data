Makes it unlawful to terminate, cancel, or fail to renew any person who acted as an importer or distributor as of January 1, 1987, of such motor vehicles in the United States except for just cause. Declares that such restrictions shall not apply if the President certifies to the Congress that the motor vehicle distribution system in Japan is not a substantial nontariff barrier to the sale in Japan of U.S. motor vehicles. Provides for civil actions by persons injured by a violation of this Act."
