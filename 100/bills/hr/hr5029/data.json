    "text": "Ute Indian Water Settlement Act of 1988 - Increases authorized appropriations for construction of the Upalco Unit and Taskeech Dam of the Colorado River Storage Project which provides water and power to the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Authorizes appropriations for storage projects, irrigation improvements, and the Whiterocks Dam for the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. Authorizes appropriations for and creates the Ute Indian Water Deferral Trust Fund with monies to be held by the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, Utah, as compensation for deferring the use and development of irrigable farmland and the related water diversion requirement. Restricts use of the deferred water to diversion directly from the Green River. Directs the Bureau of Reclamation to maintain certain stream flows and to transfer acreage at the proposed site of the Lower Stillwater Reservoir as a wildlife mitigation measure. Allocates funds for the Uintah Irrigation Project. Provides for: (1) non-Federal operation and construction of Project facilities; (2) water right losses for nonpayment of assessments; and (3) lease of available water. Ratifies, confirms, and approves the compact among the Ute Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, the State of Utah, and the United States (the Ute Indian Water Compact)."
