    "text": "Ban Nuclear Power in Earth Orbit Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress encouraging the President to call on the Soviet Union to abandon the use of nuclear power sources in Earth orbit and to join the United States in negotiation to establish a permanent ban on such use. Directs the President to certify to the Congress at least 90 days after this Act's enactment whether the Soviet Union has indicated an official policy to abandon the use of nuclear power sources in Earth orbit. Prohibits the launch into Earth orbit of any U.S. owned or funded spacecraft if the President certifies the Soviet Union's policy to abandon the use in question. Terminates the prohibition if the Soviet Union places a nuclear power source into Earth orbit after indicating its official policy not to do so. Excepts nuclear power sources for a moon base or for deep space scientific and exploration missions. Requires the use of uranium rather than plutonium to fuel nuclear power sources for these latter missions after December 31, 1998. Requires, as well, after the same date, that nuclear power sources be launched, whenever practicable, only on unmanned launch vehicles and be activated only after the spacecraft have achieved a safe deep space trajectory."
