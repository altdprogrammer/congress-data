    "text": "Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and implement activities to assist State radon programs such as: (1) establishing an information clearinghouse; (2) designing and implementing training seminars for government officials; (3) demonstrating radon mitigation methods; and (4) establishing a national data base on the location and amounts of radon. Authorizes the Administrator to provide a State with technical assistance in developing or implementing programs addressing radon, including: (1) surveys of radon location and occurrence; (2) public information programs; and (3) controlling radon in existing or new structures. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress annually on a plan to implement this assistance program. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States on an annual basis for radon assessment and mitigation, covering the same types of activities the Administrator may provide directly through technical assistance. Grants priority to State projects which involve serious radon contamination or potential for reduction, including the development of innovative techniques. Limits the Federal share of costs to 75 percent. Limits per State grants to 15 percent of the total funds available. Places other limitations on the uses of grant money. Directs the Administrator to study the extent of radon contamination in the Nation's school buildings, including a statistical survey of radon levels and a list of school districts where radon levels probably exceed target levels for remedial action. Authorizes the Administrator to provide technical assistance, information, and equipment to States for conducting radon tests. Authorizes the Administrator to undertake diagnostic and remedial effects at high radon level school buildings to develop the necessary technology. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress annually for two years on activities under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
