Subjects facilities which perform poorly on such surveys to an extended survey. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to perform a special survey when there is reason to question a facility's compliance with Medicare requirements. Requires the disclosure of survey results. Subjects end stage renal disease facilities to the same enforcement process as skilled nursing facilities are subject to when found out of compliance with Medicare requirements. Directs the Secretary to establish a board of experts and patients to advise the Secretary in establishing end stage renal disease service providers quality standards and survey protocols. Requires suppliers to cooperate with renal disease network plans and goals. Requires renal disease networks to inform renal disease patients of their rights and conduct surveys to ensure that service providers protect, promote, and inform patients of such rights."
