Provides that certain land entitlement payments made by the United States to States on which Federal land is located shall cease to be made with regard to lands transferred to the State of Utah at the end of the second fiscal year after such land exchange is made. Provides that the United States shall make payments in lieu of taxes on lands acquired by the United States in such exchange, requiring such payments to be made to the Governor of Utah."
