Bases such State \"on\" or \"off\" indicator on whether the weekly average rate of individuals exhausting regular unemployment compensation benefits for the week in question and the preceding 12 weeks exceeded 25 percent. Directs the Secretary of Labor to compile, on a weekly basis for each State, statistics on the number of individuals receiving their first regular benefits for their current benefit years and the number of individuals exhausting such benefits."
