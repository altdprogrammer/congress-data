Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Nevada shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Nevada which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Nevada reviewed in the RARE II program and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Nevada without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system roadless lands in Nevada which are less than 5,000 acres in size and other specified areas. Permits livestock grazing in such wilderness areas, subject to mandatory review by the Secretary of Agriculture. Designates the Mount Rose National Recreation Area in the Toiyabe National Forest to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as specified. Title II: Land Transfers - Transfers specified public lands to the Toiyabe or Inyo National Forests. Transfers specified national forest lands to the Bureau of Land Management. Requires wilderness study areas transferred to the national forest system to be managed as wilderness until the Secretary of Agriculture recommends wilderness designations to certain congressional committees and the President. States that other lands transferred to such system be deemed to have been adequately considered for wilderness for purposes of initial land management plan requirements. Sets forth other management provisions, including the administration of receipts and existing land use authorizations. Title III: General Provisions - Authorizes appropriations."
