Requires determination of the fair market value every five years. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Agricultural Marketing Service, to fix and collect user fees for: (1) tobacco and cotton news reports; (2) plant variety certificates of protection; and (3) marketing agreements and marketing orders. Requires the Secretary of Energy to collect a fee on the sale of electric power by the Federal Power Marketing Administration. Sets forth a formula for the determination of such fee."
