Directs the Secretary to recommend to the Congress undeveloped coastal barriers along the Great Lakes that are appropriate for inclusion in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Prohibits the Secretary from recommending any area which is publicly owned and protected by Federal or State law, or held by a qualified organization primarily for wildlife refuge, sanctuary, recreational, or natural resource conservation purposes. Directs the Secretary, before making the recommendations, to consult with Federal agencies, States bordering on the Great Lakes, and the public. Directs the Secretary to review the System maps at least once every five years and make modifications to reflect changes occurring as a result of natural forces. Requires reviews be made in consultation with appropriate States, coastal zone management agencies, Federal agencies, and the public. States that limitations on Federal expenditures under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act shall not apply to highways located within Michigan if the Congress adds new units to the Coastal Barrier Resources System, and those units include portions of U.S. or State highways in Michigan."
