Directs the Secretary of State to submit to the Committee all proposed international science and technology agreements, before submission to the prospective foreign government partner, for review of their technological and economic desirability. Requires that the Committee develop language for inclusion in any agreement to protect U.S. interests in the disposition of inventions, technical data, and computer software, made or delivered in the performance of any federally-funded research and development, which are covered by the agreement. Requires the Committee to recommend negotiating goals for the United States Trade Representative to follow in negotiations with foreign countries to increase the degree of equivalent technological access between the United States and foreign countries. Mandates that the Committee prepare and submit to the Congress an annual report, including: (1) a description of all such agreements entered into that year; (2) recommendations for administrative or legislative changes in U.S. policy that would improve equivalent technological access between the United States and foreign countries; (3) an explanation of the general concept of equivalent technological access, and suggestions as to how that concept might be refined; (4) a description of the negotiating goals recommended to the United States Trade Representative; and (5) an assessment of the progress made by the Trade Representative in achieving such goals during that year."
