Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior through FY 1993 for the reimbursement of 50 percent of the costs of additional research or the synthesis of research by institutes on water problems of a regional nature. Title II: Groundwater Research Programs of the Federal Government - Part A: Programs of the Environmental Protection Agency - Directs the Administrator to establish a national research, development, and demonstration program to support the protection, maintenance, and restoration of groundwater resources of the United States. Requires such program to include research, demonstrations, and surveys of causes, prevention, and correction of groundwater contamination. States that priority shall be given to projects which demonstrate the fate of contaminants in groundwater and develop methods and procedures for controlling pollution sources, monitoring water quality, restoring contaminated groundwater, and reducing the contaminating effects of waste materials. Directs the Administrator to investigate the effects on human health and the environment, and on the Nation's water supply needs. Directs the Administrator to establish a media-specific research committee for groundwater resources to report annually for at least five years on the major research issues of groundwater resources, the current status of the research in such issues, and a plan for the succeeding three years. Requires such report to include a list of all major policy decisions affecting groundwater, control technology projects, health effects research, and other research related to groundwater.

Requires peer review of all studies conducted under this Act. Authorizes the provision of facilities and equipment for demonstration projects under this Act, limiting construction of facilities on non-Federal land. Requires the Administrator to make grants to universities or research institutions to establish and operate eight groundwater research institutes to conduct research and training and disseminate information on the protection and restoration of groundwater. Bases selection on whether such institute would be located in a region making significant use of groundwater with significant contamination problems and the capacity of such institute to carry on and lead such research. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of costs. Earmarks funds for technology transfer. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary of the Interior to approve and evaluate each institute's research. Authorizes appropriations for the programs under this part through FY 1993.
