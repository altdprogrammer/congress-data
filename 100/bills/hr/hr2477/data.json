Makes it unlawful for any person who sells such products to a school to: (1) fail to provide the school with the necessary certificates; (2) fail to retain such certificates; (3) fail to provide the Secretary with such certificates; and (4) knowingly make a false statement on such certificates. Sets forth penalties for violations."
