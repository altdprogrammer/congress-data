Provides an affirmative defense where the defendant proves that the firearm is of a type which the Secretary of the Treasury has determined to be susceptible to detection by magnetometer. States that this Act does not apply to: (1) conduct by or under the authority of the United States; or (2) certain prototype or model firearms. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to the Congress regarding the state of firearm and firearm detection technology."
