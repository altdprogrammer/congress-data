Amends the Older American Community Service Employment Act to require that community employment projects include projects employing low-income, older individuals in the provision of day care for children and adults, and respite services for families of older individuals. Requires that at least 15 percent of the amount appropriated for any fiscal year to provide community service employment for older individuals be made available for such day care and respite service projects."
