Requires the FDA to use such system to summarize information on: (1) the types, amounts, and origins of food products; (2) the types and amounts of pesticides detected; and (3) the rate of violations and their disposition. Requires the Secretary to make summarized data from such system available to interested agencies and persons on an annual basis. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require imported raw agricultural commodities to be accompanied by documents identifying the pesticides used in their production. Requires the Secretary to amend such documents for subsequent shipments where analysis finds unreported pesticides. Directs the Secretary to keep current information on the contents and administrators of pesticide registration and monitoring programs of countries which export significant quantities of food to the United States. Requires the Secretary to keep the FDA and such countries informed of information compiled, including violations. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines for laboratory audit procedures to assure the reliability of pesticide residue monitoring results. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and report to the appropriate congressional committees on a research plan for pesticide analytical methods."
