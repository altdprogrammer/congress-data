Reduces, by ten percent, Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and facilities which fail to make such inoculations available. Requires that such funds withheld from noncompliant hospitals and facilities be used to make grants to hospitals and facilities to fund hepatitis B vaccine purchases. Allows hospital and facility employees to exercise an informed choice not to receive such a vaccination."
