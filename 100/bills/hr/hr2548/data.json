Prohibits, if the purpose is to further the interests of the PLO: (1) the receipt of anything of value except informational material from the PLO; (2) the expenditure of funds from the PLO; or (3) the establishment or maintenance of a PLO office within the jurisdiction of the United States. Provides that the provisions of this Act shall cease to have effect if the President certifies to the Congress that the PLO no longer practices or supports terrorist actions."
