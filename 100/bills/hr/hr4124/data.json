    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, in lieu of S. 2384) Authorizes appropriations for the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act for FY 1989 through 1991. Makes such Act effective until the end of FY 1991. Extends the funding of striped bass studies under the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act through FY 1991. Authorizes the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to make specified determinations at any other time it deems necessary (in addition to its required annual determinations in December of each fiscal year). Requires the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for Fisheries, to: (1) undertake a study of the striped bass fishery resources and habitats of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area; (2) develop short-term and long-term recommendations for Federal and State government agencies for restoring and conserving such resources and habitats; and (3) submit such study results and recommendations to the Congress and the States of North Carolina and Virginia, within 36 months after enactment of this Act. Provides for study contents, participation by specified State and Federal agencies, and consultation with various entities. Authorizes appropriations for such study. Prohibits funds appropriated under specified provisions of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act from being used for the study. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations governing the fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) which are consistent with the national standards set forth in provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and necessary and appropriate to: (1) ensure the effectiveness of State regulations or a Federal moratorium on fishing for such fish within the coastal waters of a coastal State; and (2) achieve conservation and management goals for the Atlantic striped bass resource. Allows the appropriate Regional Fishery Mangement Councils to prepare a fishery management plan on Atlantic striped bass. Declares that if a plan is approved and implemented by the Secretary, it shall supersede any regulations promulgated by a State under this Act. Makes provisions of the Magnuson Act regarding prohibited acts, civil penalties, criminal offenses, civil forfeitures, and enforcement apply to regulations and plans issued under provisions of this Act relating to regulation of striped bass fishing in the EEZ. Terminates the provisions of this Act relating to regulation of such fishing in the EEZ on September 30, 1991."
