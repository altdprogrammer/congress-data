    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to issue guidelines governing the use and installation of automatic sprinkler systems and smoke detectors in places of public accommodation. Includes within such guidelines the requirements that, in each public accommodation: (1) an automatic smoke detection system be installed in accordance with the appropriate American National Standard for Fire Alarm Systems; and (2) an automatic sprinkler system be installed in accordance with the appropriate American National Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, except in places that are two stories or lower, have no interior corridors, and have immediate exterior egress from rooms to a ground level area. Requires States to submit to the Director lists of public accommodations which meet such guidelines so that the Director can compile, publish, and distribute to Federal agencies a master list of all public accommodations that meet such guidelines. Authorizes the Director to take steps to encourage States to promote the use of automatic sprinkler and smoke detection systems and to disseminate information on the life safety value and use of such systems. Amends Federal law to limit the studies and surveys conducted to establish the lodging expenses of Federal employees on official business to public accommodations which meet such guidelines. Prohibits the General Services Administration (GSA) from listing rates offered by places of public accommodation which do not meet such guidelines in any directory of lodging accommodations for Federal employees on official business. Requires that such directories include a description of the access and safety devices which each listed public accommodation provides for handicapped guests. Prohibits Federal funding for the specified purpose of sponsoring conferences, meetings, and similar events at public accommodations that do not meet such guidelines."
