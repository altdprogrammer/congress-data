Requires the Secretaries to submit to the President and the Congress an interim report by July 1, 1989, and a final report by July 1, 1990, regarding the manner and extent to which the Task Force carried out its tasks. Terminates the Task Force 60 days after the submittal of such final report. Authorizes appropriations for the Task Force for FY 1989 and 1990. Establishes the Social Security Earnings Reconciliation Commission which shall: (1) conduct a comprehensive study of the issues pertaining to discrepancies in earnings credited under the OASDI program and Internal Revenue Code; and (2) report its findings and recommendations to the President and to the Congress by July 15, 1990. Terminates the Commission 60 days after the submittal of its final report. Authorizes appropriations for the Commission for FY 1989 and 1990. Prohibits the Congress from considering any legislation which effects a reduction in benefits under the OASDI program or title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act. Considers the enactment of such prohibition to be an exercise of congressional rulemaking powers, subject to change in the same manner and to the same extent as any other rule of the House of Representatives or the Senate. Title II: Establishment of the Social Security Administration - Amends title VII (Administration) of the Social Security Act to establish as an independent executive agency a Social Security Administration, headed by a Social Security Board. Provides that it shall be the duty of the Administration to administer the OASDI and SSI programs. Requires the Board to study and make recommendations as to the most effective methods of providing economic security through social insurance and as to legislation and matters of administrative policy. Establishes in the Administration: (1) a Commissioner of Social Security; (2) a Deputy Commissioner of Social Security; (3) a General Counsel; (4) an Inspector General; and (5) an Office of the Beneficiary Ombudsman, to be headed by a Beneficiary Ombudsman who shall represent the interests of beneficiaries under the OASDI and SSI programs within the Administration. Requires the annual report of the Board to include a description of the activities of the Beneficiary Ombudsman. Requires the Board to make annual budgetary recommendations relating to the Administration. Requires that appropriations requests by the Administration for staffing and personnel be based upon a comprehensive workforce plan as established by the Board. Provides for the apportionment of administrative costs. Requires the annual report of the Board to include a section reflecting the use of budget authority provided to the Administration. Requires that authority for automated data processing procurement and facilities construction be provided in the form of contract authority covering the total cost of such acquisitions. Makes amounts needed for the liquidation of contract authority so provided available from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to the extent that such amounts are not needed to meet current obligations for benefit payments. Requires the Board and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to implement demonstration projects relating to personnel matters. Directs the Board and the Administrator of General Services to implement such projects relating to delegations from the Administrator. Specifies the authorities which are to be delegated to the Board from the Administrator and the Director. Requires the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees concerning such projects, including an evaluation of the Board's readiness to assume full and permanent authority. Requires the Board to cause a seal of office to be made and judicial notice taken thereof. Provides for the transfer to the Administration of all functions carried out by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to the programs and activities to be carried out by the Administration under this Act. Abolishes the position of Commissioner of Social Security in the Department of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary and the Social Security Board to take such measures as are necessary to ensure that this Act's provisions do not result in staffing or service reductions involving the functions transferred. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the President and the Congress by July 1, 1990, on the extent to which such staffing or service cuts have been avoided. Sets forth effective date and transitional rule provisions. Title III: Conforming Amendments and Rules of Construction - Requires the Secretary and the Board to report to the Congress within 120 days after the beginning of each regular session on their administration under this Act. Requires the Secretary to study and make recommendations on the most effective methods of providing economic security and on the administrative policy for the programs. Directs the Board to appoint, quadrennially, an Advisory Council on the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Program and an Advisory Council on Health and Supplementary Medical Insurance to review the relation of the trust funds supporting the OASDI program and the Medicare program and the long-term commitments of those programs. Requires each council to submit a report to the Board for transmittal to the Congress and the Board of Trustees of each Trust Fund."
