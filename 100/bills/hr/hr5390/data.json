Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) determine those beneficiary countries that comply with such requirement; and (2) advise the President of those countries that do not. Sets forth an exception to such suspension. Directs the United States Trade Representative to use the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations to promote reforestation in developing countries."
