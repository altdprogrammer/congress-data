    "text": "Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act - Provides for the partition of the joint Hoopa Valley and Yurok Reservation. Requires the Hoopa Valley Tribe to waive all claims against the United States and to affirm consent to the contribution of Hoopa Escrow monies to the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Fund for payments to the Yurok Tribe before the partition shall become effective. Establishes the Hoopa Valley and Yurok Reservations. Requires the unallotted trust lands and assets of each tribe to be held in trust by the United States for each tribe. Places all national forest lands within the Yurok Reservation in trust for the use and benefit of the Yurok Tribe, subject to valid existing rights and subject to the adoption of a resolution of the Interim Council of the Yurok Tribe. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report concerning the advisability of conveying to the Yurok Tribe all right, title, and interest of the United States to all National Park System lands within the Yurok Reservation. Sets the boundary between the Hoopa Valley and Yurok Reservations. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the unallotted trust land and assets of the Yurok Reservation until the tribe has organized. Requires, thereafter, that such land and assets be administered as tribal trust land and governed by the Tribe. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands or interests in lands, including rights-of-way for access to trust lands in the Reservation. Establishes the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Fund for distributions pursuant to this Act. Divides fund assets between the tribes based on settlement roll calculations. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund. Prescribes preparation and eligibility criteria for the Hoopa-Yurok settlement roll. Allows an election among the following settlement options: (1) Hoopa tribal membership option (based on the criteria of the court decision in the Short case); (2) Yurok tribal membership option; and (3) lump sum payment option. Extinguishes interest in tribal property of persons receiving payments. Provides for division of the remaining settlement funds. Ratifies and confirms the existing documents of the Hoopa Valley Tribe. Provides for recognition and organization of the Yurok Tribe. Establishes the Yurok Transition Team and an Interim Council preceding election and installation of the tribal governing body. Requires the Secretary to develop an economic development plan for the Yurok Tribe. Allows the land assignment on the Hoopa Valley Reservation made to the Smokers family to continue to relatives of one-fourth or more Indian blood. Provides for a merger of the Rancherias with the Yurok Tribe if certain conditions are met. Adds representatives of the Yurok Tribe and the Karuk Tribe to the Klamath River Basin Fisheries Task Force. Specifies the term of office. Provides that the proceeds of the sale of timber from Indian trust lands, after deduction for administrative expenses, shall be used: (1) as determined by the governing bodies of the tribes concerned and approved by the Secretary; or (2) in the absence of such a governing body, as determined by the Secretary for the tribe concerned. Sets limitations on actions challenging the joint reservation partition under this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress a report describing any claims decisions."
