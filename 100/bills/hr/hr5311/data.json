    "text": "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Amendments of 1988 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit any financial connection between the contractor who conducts a school asbestos inspection or assists in preparing a school asbestos management plan and the contractor who carries out such plan. Requires that in monitoring school air for asbestos: (1) transmission electron microscopes having a specified sensitivity limit be used; (2) such monitoring be conducted in the manner most likely to detect asbestos; and (3) no financial connection exist between monitors and contractors implementing asbestos response actions. Requires that the model school asbestos contractor accreditation plan for States, developed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), include a State-approved contractor training course and require that those who have passed the accreditation exam engage in supervised work experience before achieving accreditation. Directs the Administrator and the States to establish procedures for terminating accreditation. Requires the Administrator to conduct a study and report to the Congress within six months of this Act's enactment on the need for and feasibility of agreements between States to create reciprocity in accreditation between States. Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop and implement a plan for conducting random, on-site school inspections to ensure that asbestos response actions are carried out in a manner that protects human health and the environment; (2) require school asbestos contractors to provide assurances of financial responsibility for all liabilities arising out of their work; and (3) delineate the division of responsibility between the EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for worker safety under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response program. Authorizes school employees who are directed to conduct emergency repairs which may involve asbestos or to conduct operations and maintenance activities to refuse to conduct such activities unless they are provided with proper equipment and training and allowed to follow safe work practices. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations within 120 days of this Act's enactment requiring owners of Federal, State, and commercial buildings to conduct asbestos inspections in and, if asbestos is present, develop and implement asbestos management plans for such buildings. Sets deadlines for the implementation and completion of such activities. Imposes civil monetary penalties against building owners who violate such regulations. Directs the Administrator to conduct a study and report to the Congress within 120 days of this Act's enactment on the feasibility of tracking asbestos-containing material removed from schools to assure that it is transported and disposed of in a manner protective of human health and the environment. Establishes an Asbestos Abatement Scientific Commission which shall assess available asbestos response actions for their effectiveness and appropriateness in protecting human health and the environment. Sets forth reporting requirements."
