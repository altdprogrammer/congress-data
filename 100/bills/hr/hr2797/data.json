    "text": "Harvest Disaster Relief Act of 1987 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, using the funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation, to provide generic commodity certificates to producers of agricultural commodities to cover the value of crop losses arising from the inability to harvest a commodity because the particular locality suffered a farmworker labor shortage. Requires a State Governor to petition the Secretary to declare an area eligible for such disaster relief. Specifies that: (1) the shortage of farmworkers must result from a decrease in the number of foreign nationals seeking such work since May 1, 1987; and (2) the area as a whole must have suffered at least a 20 percent loss in the normal year's dollar value of the particular commodity due to the worker shortage. Applies to harvests beginning after May 1, 1987, and before December 31, 1988."
