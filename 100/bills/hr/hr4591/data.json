Prohibits such transfer until the Secretary of Energy complies with certain National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requirements regarding site selection for the permanent disposition and stabilization of residual radioactive materials. Requires the Secretary of Energy to obtain the appropriate State's consent before acquiring lands upon which there is no: (1) designated processing site; or (2) active uranium mill operation. Terminates the Secretary of Energy's authority to perform remedial action on September 30, 1994. Provides that the Secretary's authority to perform groundwater restoration activities shall not expire."
