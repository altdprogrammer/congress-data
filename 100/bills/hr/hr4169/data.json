    "text": "Electric Power Bankruptcy Amendments of 1988 - Amends Federal bankruptcy provisions to require that, in a reorganization case involving a debtor who is engaged primarily in the business of selling electric power, the trustee shall assume any executory contract for the sale or purchase of electric power from a nonnuclear source. Provides, in such a case, for the appointment by the court (as soon as practicable after the order for relief) of a committee of ten petitioners who regularly purchase electric power from the debtor (five residential and five nonresidential users) to act as a creditors' committee. Allows a representative of the legislative body of a State in which the electric power is consumed by persons who regularly purchase electric power from the debtor to raise an appeal and be heard on any issue in the case. Limits the powers of the court to supersede, modify, or interfere with the operation of nonbankruptcy law applicable to the sale or purchase of electric power from a nonnuclear source by such a debtor."
