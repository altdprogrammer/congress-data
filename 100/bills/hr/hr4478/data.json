Requires such mail matter to bear on its face in conspicuous type that it is a solicitation of donations and that the addressee is under no obligation to make any payment. Declares as nonmailable any mail matter which constitutes a solicitation by a non-governmental entity: (1) for the purchase of products or services which are provided free of charge or at a lower price by the Federal Government, or which are substantially the same as such products or services; (2) for the purchase of products or services and which contains a seal, insignia, trade or brand name, or any other term or symbol which reasonably could be interpreted or construed as implying Federal Government connection, approval, or endorsement; and (3) for the contribution of funds and which contains a seal, insignia, trade or brand name, or any other term which could reasonably be interpreted or construed as implying Federal Government connection, approval, or endorsement. Allows the mailing of such matter if it contains a conspicuous disclaimer that it is not a Government document. Provides an exception from such classification as nonmailable matter for publications for which the addressee has paid or promised to pay a consideration or which the addressee has otherwise indicated a desire to receive, unless the solicitation is on behalf of the publisher of the publication. Establishes penalties for violations of this Act."
