Authorizes a coastal State to apply to the Secretary for approval of its coastal erosion and flood control assistance program. Specifies requirements for a program and circumstances in which the Secretary may suspend approval of a program. Establishes the Coastal Erosion and Flood Control Assistance Fund for making grants under provisions of this Act and administration of such provisions. Sets forth reporting requirements."
