Defines \"insider trading\" as using any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, the mails, or any facility of a national securities exchange to buy or sell a security to which inside information pertains, or to communicate inside information to any person knowing that such communication is likely to result in trading on the basis of such information. Sets forth certain affirmative defenses based on the second party's knowledge of the inside information."
