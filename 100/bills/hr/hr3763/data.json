Declares that neither the Federal act of state doctrine nor the doctrine of sovereign immunity shall constitute grounds to refuse to enforce or confirm any arbitral award. Authorizes prejudgment attachment to secure satisfaction against an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state in certain circumstances. Provides for execution of a judgment against a broader range of commercial property owned by a foreign state."
