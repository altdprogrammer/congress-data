    "text": "Panama Canal Commission Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 - Authorizes expenditures for FY 1989 for the Panama Canal Commission (Commission) to operate and maintain the Panama Canal. Limits the amount of funds which may be used for official reception and representation expenses. Prohibits the use of funds to implement an increase in the rates of tolls for use of the Panama Canal during FY 1989. Authorizes the use of funds for the purchase of passenger motor vehicles for the use of Commission personnel without regard to certain price limitations. Specifies a maximum amount of funds which may be used for capital outlays. Requires the Commission to provide written advance notice to the Congress regarding: (1) any proposed change in rates of tolls for use of the Panama Canal that may be necessary after the end of FY 1989; (2) any payment estimated to be due Panama under provisions of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977; and (3) the initiation of any capital acquisition or construction project exceeding a certain amount, which is not specified in the budget estimates submitted to the Congress for the fiscal year in which the project will occur. Authorizes the use of funds for pay increases for Commission employees which are not in excess of statutory increases granted for the same period in corresponding rates of compensation of other U.S. Government employees in comparable positions."
