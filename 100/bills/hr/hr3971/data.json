    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) International Child Abduction Remedies Act - Grants State courts and U.S. district courts concurrent original jurisdiction with regard to actions arising under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Retains Federal court jurisdiction in cases arising under the Convention where such jurisdiction would otherwise exist under Federal law (Federal question, diversity of citizenship, etc.). Sets forth requirements with regard to notice and burden of proof for such actions. Allows any court exercising jurisdiction over a petition filed pursuant to the Convention or this Act to take provisional measures under Federal or State law to protect the well-being of the child or prevent the child's removal or concealment. Prohibits any court from ordering the provisional removal of a child from the person having physical control unless the applicable requirements of State law are satisfied. States that any application submitted to the U.S. Central Authority or petition seeking judicial remedies in accordance with the terms of the Convention shall be admissible in court without regard to the need for authentication. Directs the President to designate a Federal agency to serve as the Central Authority for the United States for the purposes of: (1) issuing regulations to implement the Convention and this Act; (2) obtaining information from the Parent Locator Service; and (3) collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information for purposes relating to the Convention and this Act. Places certain limitations on the dissemination of Government information to the Central Authority. Directs the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Attorney General to designate Federal employees and private citizens to serve as an interagency coordinating group to monitor the operation of the Convention and provide advice on its implementation. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with the Central Authority which would make the services of the Parent Locator Service available to the Central Authority. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of the Convention and this Act."
