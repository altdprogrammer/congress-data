Requires solicitations made in writing to: (1) be presented in readily understandable language; (2) be located in a conspicuous place; and (3) appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast with other printed matter on the solicitation. Required solicitations made through audio communication to be clearly audible and in language readily understandable.
