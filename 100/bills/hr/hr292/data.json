Sets forth certification and reporting requirements with respect to the programs of such entities with more than five full-time employees. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), at least every five years, to investigate the employment practices of each of such entities to determine compliance with program requirements. Establishes penalties for failing to comply with such requirements. Permits employees or applicants for employment who believe they have been discriminated against in violation of program requirements to file a complaint with the FCC. Requires FCC regulations to specify procedures for investigating such complaints and enforcing program requirements."
