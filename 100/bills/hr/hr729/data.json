States that non-designated areas within the CDCA have been adequately studied for inclusion in the System and are therefore released from otherwise applicable restrictions. Designates eight areas within the CDCA for study to determine their suitability for inclusion in such System. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to give priority to consolidating Federal ownership within this Act's wilderness areas. Requires the Secretary to exchange Federal land for California land located within the boundaries of such wilderness areas. Authorizes appropriations."
