States that upon request of the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation, the Secretary must allocate to the Texas Turnpike Authority the amounts that would be payable to the Department as the Federal share of project costs if the Department were implementing a project. Mandates such allocations from sums apportioned to Texas for Federal-aid primary system projects."
