Sets aside a specified amount for the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project for an irrigation and drainage system. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the construction of facilities for the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation under a deferral agreement between the United States, the Tribe, and the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (District). Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with non-Federal entities for the design and construction of the Bonneville Unit Irrigation and drainage system. Lists certain features of the Bonneville Unit that are not to be funded. Directs the District to develop comprehensive water conservation plans for all systems of the Central Utah Project. Directs the Secretary to form an interagency task force to be known as the Central Utah Project Fish and Wildlife Task Force to review and coordinate accomplishment of the fish and wildlife mitigation program for the Central Utah Project. Sets forth the stream flows to be provided in the Uinta Basin and for the Bonneville Unit. Makes funds available for canal, reservoir, stream, and habitat improvements in the Uinta Basin."
