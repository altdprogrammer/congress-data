Rept. 100-497) Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish an alternative procedure for implementing the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings) sequestration orders as they affect specified annual loan, deficiency, disaster, and diversion payments for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, long staple rice, and soybeans. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to: (1) calculate the market effects of a sequestration order on such programs; and (2) reduce the sequestration reduction percentage if such effects would serve to reduce commodity outlays by more than the required sequestration percentage."
