Taxes the lesser of the capital gain net income or the capital gain net income with respect to assets held for five years or less. Determines the amount of tax liability by applying rates inversely proportional to the length of time the asset is held, with the maximum rate (28 percent) applicable to short-term gains (assets held for six months or less)."
