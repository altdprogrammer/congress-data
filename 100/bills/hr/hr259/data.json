Provides that for the 1988 through 1990 wheat crops: (1) the established price shall not be less than $4.40 per bushel for the first 15,000 bushels of a person's production, and $4.00 for each additional bushel; and (2) such payments shall not be made to any producer with a wheat acreage base of less than 15 acres. Provides that for the 1988 through 1990 corn crops: (1) the established price shall not be less than $3.05 per bushel for the first 30,000 bushels of a person's production, and $2.75 per bushel for each additional bushel; and (2) such payments shall not be made to any producer with a feed grain acreage base for each commodity of less than 15 acres. Makes the mandatory 50 percent planting requirement discretionary for purposes of specified wheat and feed grain acreage limitation payments."
