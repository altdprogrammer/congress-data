    "text": "Adult Education Amendments of 1987 - Amends title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (commonly known as the Adult Education Act) to declare the purpose of such title to assist States to improve educational opportunities for adult who lack the level of literacy skills requisite to effective citizenship and productive employment, to expand and improve the current system for delivering adult education services, and to encourage the establishment of adult education programs. Authorizes appropriations for such programs for FY 1988 and such sums as necessary through FY 1993. Provides for the allotment of such funds, including minimum allotments based on FY 1984 Federal payments. Sets forth the circumstances under which grants made by the Secretary of Education to the States for adult education programs may be used to carry out programs for a for-profit agency, organization, or institution. Limits to 20 percent the amount of a State's allotment that may be used for programs of equivalency for a certificate of graduation from a secondary school. Authorizes States to allot a specified portion of grants for private sector adult education training designed to provide literacy and other basic skills to improve the productivity of current employees through the use of business, industry, labor organizations, and education partnerships. Requires that 95 percent of funds provided by States to eligible recipients be expended for adult instructional activities. Sets forth the responsibilities of State educational agencies in carrying out this title. Requires any participating State to establish or designate a State advisory council on adult education. (Currently, the establishment of such councils is discretionary.) Requires such council to evaluate adult education programs at least once every two years and advise the Governor, the State legislature, the State agency, and the general public of its findings and recommendations. Requires States for FY 1988 and each fourth year thereafter, to submit to the Secretary a plan and application for adult education for the four succeeding fiscal years. Sets forth: (1) procedures required in formulating State plans, including meeting with the advisory council and conducting public hearings; (2) required assessments to be made of the needs of eligible adults; (3) required components of the plan; and (4) assurances to be provided in State applications. Requires the Secretary to approve any amendments made to State plans which are consistent with such Act. Directs each such State agency, during the four-year period, to: (1) arrange a program review of eligible recipients each year; and (2) gather and analyze data to determine the extent to which the adult programs are achieving the goals of the plan, and the extent to which eligible recipients have improved their capacity to achieve the purposes of this title. Authorizes the use of funds allotted to a State for: (1) special projects involving innovative methods, systems, materials or programs for educating the handicapped, the homeless, and persons of limited English-speaking ability; and (2) training personnel to carry out the purposes of this title. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a program of making grants to States to support planning, developing, and evaluating programs designed to provide adult education programs, services, and activities to meet the special needs of migrant farmworkers and immigrants. Directs the Secretary to assist States in evaluating the status and progress of adult education in achieving the purposes of this title. Directs the Secretary to determine the criteria for defining literacy and to identify those skills that comprise the basic educational skills needed for literate functioning. Requires the Secretary to determine an accurate estimate of the number of illiterate adults in the Nation. Directs the Secretary to report every four years to the President and to the Congress on the status of literacy and adult education. Directs the Secretary, three years after enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on an evaluation of programs required under this title, together with recommendations. Requires the Secretary to make grants to States and eligible recipients for programs to train adult volunteers, especially the elderly, who wish to participate as tutors in local adult education programs. Directs the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report jointly to the Congress on Federal funding for and services for adult education programs currently available, including literacy initiatives offered by public and private agencies. Directs the Secretary of Education to establish a national clearinghouse to compile information on literacy curricula and resources for adults, including youth and adults of limited English proficiency and adults with handicaps. Authorizes appropriations for grants concerning Indian adult education for FY 1988 and such sums as necessary for FY 1989 through 1993."
