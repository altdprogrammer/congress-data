    "text": "Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to change the tariff treatment of motor fuel, motor fuel blending stock, and naphthas. Defines \"motor fuel blending stock\" to mean any product derived primarily from petroleum, shale oil, or natural gas, whether or not containing additives, to be used for direct blending in the manufacture of motor fuel. Removes natural gas, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and mixtures thereof from articles free of duty if they are used as motor fuel or motor fuel blending stock. Adds motor fuel blending stock to the articles subject to the tariff on fuel. Replaces the fixed rates of duty with six percent ad valorem and 12 percent ad valorem tariffs. Expands the exception to the tariff on kerosene to include motor fuel blending stocks. Changes the exception from the tariff on naphthas to include those to be used as motor fuel blending stock. Amends the tariff on mixtures of hydrocarbons to provide an exception for those used as motor fuel blending stock."
