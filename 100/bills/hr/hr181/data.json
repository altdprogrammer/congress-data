Amends the SSI program to extend SSI eligibility to residents of halfway houses. (Currently, such assistance is provided to those in public emergency shelter.) Eliminates the three-month per year limit on the eligibility of halfway house and emergency shelter residents. Provides for the classification of chronically mentally ill individuals as presumptively disabled and thus eligible for immediate SSI payments. Provides full SSI benefits to chronically mentally ill individuals through their third month at a medical institution if they continue to maintain and pay the expenses of a home to which they may return upon discharge."
