Rept. 100-251) Amends the Public Health Service Act to extend through 1990, while increasing the authorization of appropriations, the program of project grants to assist States and localities in immunizing, without charge, persons, including children, against vaccine-preventable diseases. States that certain provisions of this Act do not prohibit grantees from accepting voluntary donations from individuals to whom the grantee has provided an immunization. Prohibits grantees from refusing to provide an immunization to an individual on the ground that the individual will not provide a voluntary donation with respect to the immunization. States that existing provisions authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants include making grants for the prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases for: (1) research; (2) demonstration projects; (3) public information and education; and (4) education, training, and clinical skills improvement activities. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, to maintain a six-month stockpile of vaccines. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990."
