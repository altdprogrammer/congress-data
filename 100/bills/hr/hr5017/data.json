Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to exempt a subsidiary of a registered holding company from the proscription against the issuance or selling of its own securities (including the alteration of stockholder rights to such securities) if such transactions are solely for its business and have been expressly authorized by the pertinent State regulatory authority. Permits a registered holding company to acquire: (1) business interests of a non-public utility nature whose book value aggregates 15 percent of its total consolidated assets; and (2) additional business interests which the Commission finds consistent with the public interest or the protection of investors or consumers."
