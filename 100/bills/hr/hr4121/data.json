Empowers the Board to: (1) review and evaluate health and safety standards at each Department of Energy (Department) nuclear facility; (2) investigate events or practices at each facility which may adversely affect public safety; (3) review a facility's design and construction as it pertains to public health and safety; and (4) recommend to the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) the health and safety measures needed to ensure adequate protection of the public. Grants the Board access to Department nuclear facility design and operational data. Authorizes the Board to: (1) establish reporting requirements which shall be binding upon the Secretary; and (2) enter into agreements with the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (and non-Federal experts) to evaluate differences between Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations and Department orders governing nuclear facilities. Requires the Secretary to cooperate fully with the Board and provide it ready access to facilities, personnel, and information requested by the Board to implement its mandate. Sets forth guidelines under which the Board's recommendations and the Secretary's decision to accept or reject them shall be publicized in the Federal Register and reported in writing to the Congress. Requires the Secretary to prepare plans to implement recommendations. Sets forth a review procedure for Board recommendations regarding a severe or imminent threat to public health and safety. Requires implementation of any such recommendations which the Secretary accepts. Requires the Board and the Secretary to report annually to the Congress regarding their respective activities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993."
