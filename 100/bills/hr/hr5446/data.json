    "text": "Elementary School Improvement Project Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to make demonstration grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to conduct programs designed to reduce the student-to-teacher ratio in the primary grades of elementary schools. Requires each LEA that receives such a grant to establish and maintain in schools under its jurisdiction an average student-to-teacher ratio of not more than 15 students per teacher, and a maximum ratio of not more than 18 students per teacher. Applies such ratios to: (1) the first grades of such schools for each year for which the grant is received; (2) the second grades for the second and third years of the grant; and (3) the third grades for the third year of the grant. Sets forth selection criteria, application requirements, and payment procedures for such grants. Sets the Federal share of the cost of activities caried out under such a grant at: (1) 90 percent for the first year; (2) 70 percent for the second year; and (3) 50 percent for the third year. Allows the non-Federal share to be in cash or in kind. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and succeeding fiscal years to carry out this Act."
