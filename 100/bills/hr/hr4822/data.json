    "text": "Drug Free America Act of 1988 - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to collect a customs fee from each passenger aboard a flight which begins outside the United States and terminates within the United States. Exempts passengers on flights conducted by the Department of Defense from such fee. Authorizes the Secretary to use such fees to pay the costs incurred by the U.S. Customs Service in conducting drug interdiction activities associated with processing such passengers. Requires the President to develop plans for multinational drug strike forces in which Western Hemisphere countries and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, respectively, would participate to combat illicit narcotics production and trafficking through military actions and coordination of intelligence activities. Urges the President to negotiate with Western Hemisphere and NATO countries to implement such plans. Directs the President to report to the Congress on such plans and negotiations. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require States, as a condition of receiving discretionary and drug law enforcement funding, to certify that they require individuals who are convicted and placed on probation for first offenses similar to those established in the Controlled Substances Act to be sentenced to perform community service. Provides that such eligibility requirement will not apply to any State that cannot make such certification until the conclusion of the first regular legislative session of such State."
