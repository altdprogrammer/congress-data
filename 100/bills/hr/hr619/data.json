Defines \"district heating or cooling property\" as any equipment or other property used as an integral part of a district heating or cooling system. Exempts district heating or cooling property which is transferred to a governmental unit or tax-exempt organization from the recapture rules relating to prohibited dispositions of investment tax credit property. Classifies district heating or cooling property as five-year property for purposes of depreciation under the accelerated cost recovery system. Excludes obligations for local district heating or cooling facilities from the volume cap on private activity bonds."
