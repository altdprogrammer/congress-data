Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to declare that any recommendations of the President relating to the salaries of Members of Congress shall be of an advisory nature only. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to require that the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress be the rate payable for such positions on the date of enactment of this Act. Makes it out of order in the House or the Senate to consider any bill or resolution which adjusts the pay of Members or modifies income tax credits or deductions for Members as a separate and distinct class, unless: (1) it takes effect at the beginning of the subsequent Congress; and (2) it is comprised solely of items adjusting the pay of Members. Requires a record vote on such legislation."
