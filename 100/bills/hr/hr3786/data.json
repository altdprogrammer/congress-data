Directs the Secretary: (1) no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to submit to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees a plan for such program; and (2) no later than 30 days after such plan is submitted, to begin implementation of the plan. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Committees an interim report after the program has been in effect for one year, and a final report after the program is completed. Directs such final report to include a recommendation on whether female members of the armed forces should continue to serve in such combat support positions. Makes inapplicable to the above provisions current general military law which prohibits female members of the armed forces from serving in direct combat support positions."
