Requires any person who proposes to exploit a materially altered film to notify specified persons by registered mail of such intent. Permits statutory and punitive damages, including attorney's fees, to a party aggrieved by violations of the notice and disclosure requirements. Preempts State laws respecting the material alteration of films. Establishes the National Film Preservation Commission to: (1) determine methods to encourage the restoration and preservation of films; (2) report annually to the Congress regarding the efficacy of the disclosure requirements under this Act; and (3) report to the Congress whether categories of audiovisual works other than films should be brought within the scope of such disclosure requirements."
