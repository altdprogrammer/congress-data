Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress every 90 days on the use of such funds. Authorizes appropriations for such purposes for FY 1988 through 1992. Terminates authority under this Act if the Secretary certifies to the Congress that the Sandinistas no longer control the Nicaraguan Government."
