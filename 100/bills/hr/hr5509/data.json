    "text": "Critical Languages and Area Studies Program Assistance Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to eligible consortia to operate critical languages and area studies programs, to develop, construct, and acquire educational equipment, materials, and facilities, and to develop teacher training programs, texts, curricula, and other activities designed to improve and expand the instruction of foreign languages at elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1990 and 1991. Limits the maximum amount of such a demonstration grant to an eligible critical languages and area studies partnership in any single fiscal year. Requires that a consortium eligible for such demonstration grants consist of: (1) a not-for-profit corporation with extensive experience in administrating both cultural exchange programs and language and culture training programs in the United States and abroad; and (2) public or private (or both) elementary and secondary schools committed to provided quality language and area studies programs to their students and students in the surrounding area. Sets forth a special rule that the Critical Languages and Area Studies Consortium, Inc., shall not receive less than a specified amount in grants from appropriations provided for this Act."
