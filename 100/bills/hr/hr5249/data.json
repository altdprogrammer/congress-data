Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to impose civil and/or criminal penalties against persons who violate such prohibition. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations, within nine months of this Act's enactment, governing the generation, transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical waste in the Great Lakes States. Requires the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct a monitoring and research program under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 designed to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of medical waste found in and along the shores of the Great Lakes. Directs the Administrator to issue guidance, within 18 months of this Act's enactment, to all generators of infectious waste located in Great Lakes States on methods to reduce the volume and infectious quality of medical waste. Requires that copies of such guidance be provided to the Congress in a timely manner. Provides that this Act shall not be construed to prohibit the imposition of State and local laws in Great Lakes States that are more stringent than the requirements established by the Administrator pursuant to this Act."
