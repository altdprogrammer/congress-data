    "text": "Persian Gulf Navigation Protection Act of 1987 - Declares that the requirements of the War Powers Resolution became operative with respect to U.S. armed forces in the Persian Gulf on October 19, 1987. Declares that it is U.S. policy in the Gulf to: (1) keep the sea lanes open to international commerce; (2) remain neutral in the Iran-Iraq war and seek a just end to that conflict; (3) preserve the integrity of other nonbelligerent countries bordering the Gulf; (4) prevent a strategic gain by the Soviet Union in the region; (5) urge U.S. allies to participate more fully in sharing the burden of achieving and preserving peace in the region; (6) defend U.S. armed forces against aggression; and (7) pursue efforts through the United Nations to implement a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Authorizes the President, for purposes of the War Powers Resolution, to continue to deploy U.S. armed forces in the Gulf, subject to the following restrictions: (1) prohibits reregistration of vessels owned by a government or national of a country bordering the Gulf under the U.S. flag; (2) allows U.S. armed forces to escort a vessel of such a country only if the government of such country agrees to reimburse the United States for costs incurred and only for six months after the date of enactment of this Act unless reauthorized by joint resolution; and (3) requires the President to consult with the Congress before using U.S. armed forces in hostilities (other than actions necessary to repel attacks against U.S. armed forces or U.S.-flag vessels). Requires the President to report to the Congress every 30 days after enactment of this Act on the progress made in implementing the policy set forth in this Act."
