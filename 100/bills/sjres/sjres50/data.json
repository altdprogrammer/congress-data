Requires that any deficit resulting from expenditures exceeding revenue in such a year of low economic growth be extinguished within the five subsequent years. Provides for the suspension of this article in time of war or national emergency as declared by the Congress. Requires that any surplus revenue over expenditures for a fiscal year be considered revenue for the following fiscal year."
