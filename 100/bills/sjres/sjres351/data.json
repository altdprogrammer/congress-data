    "text": "Resolution for Assistance to the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance - Title I - States that it is U.S. policy to advance democracy, security, and peace in Central America consistent with the Guatemala Peace Accord, the Declaration of the Presidents of the Central American Nations, the Sapoa Agreement, and U.S. security interests. Declares the U.S. objective of enhancing the security of the United States and the democratic countries of Central America by assisting in achieving: (1) democracy in Nicaragua; (2) an end to Soviet, Cuban, and Communist bloc military assistance to Nicaragua; (3) an end to Nicaraguan aggression against its neighbors; and (4) reduction of Nicaraguan military forces to a level consistent with the security of other countries in the region. Requires the President to report bimonthly to the Congress on Nicaraguan obligation noncompliance and receipt of foreign military or security assistance. Transfers specified funds from certain defense appropriations accounts to the Agency for International Development for humanitarian assistance, civic action, non-military training, and transportation of assistance for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. Authorizes the President to transfer funds from such accounts for the indemnification of aircraft leased to transport assistance. Directs the Department of Defense to make available passive air defense equipment to ensure safety of transportation. Authorizes presidential transfers of funds for other assistance, including lethal assistance. Prohibits delivery of such escrowed assistance without subsequent congressional approval. Sets forth procedures for congressional consideration of an approval resolution. Provides for suspension of lethal assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance upon a ceasefire agreement."
