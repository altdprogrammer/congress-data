Authorizes the President to continue to deploy U.S. armed forces in the Persian Gulf, but allows the use of such forces to convoy or escort vessels owned by any government or national of a country bordering the Gulf as of June 1, 1987, only until three months after the expiration of the 60-day period specified in the Resolution (beyond which the specific authorization of the Congress, a declaration of war, or other extenuating circumstances are required)."
