    "text": "Emergency Assistance for the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance Act - Transfers to the President a specified sum of unobligated funds to provide humanitarian assistance to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance and transportation for such assistance. Earmarks a specified amount of such assistance for the purchase, repair, and transportation of communications equipment. Provides that such transferred funds shall remain available until March 31, 1989. Directs the Secretary of Defense to make available through March 31, 1989, passive air defense equipment to assure the safety of transportation provided under this Act. Provides that, after a ceasefire is negotiated between the Government of Nicaragua and the resistance, delivery of the remaining assistance shall be made in accordance with the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Welcomes proposals by the President to the Congress for bilateral and multilateral action to: (1) provide additional economic assistance to the democratic countries of Central America; (2) facilitate the growth of their economies; (3) provide a more realistic plan to assist such countries in managing their foreign debt; (4) develop these initiatives in concert with democratic allies; and (5) lift the embargo on trade and other transactions against Nicaragua, and include Nicaragua as eligible for assistance, if it is in compliance with the Guatemala Accords. Authorizes the President, after consulting with congressional leaders, to submit to the Congress requests for additional assistance to the resistance anytime within 12 months after enactment of this Act. Sets forth congressional priority procedures for taking up such requests."
