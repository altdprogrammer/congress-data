Provides for the resolution of any action brought in the Supreme Court of Palau challenging the procedure under which the Compact was approved, by allowing the Compact to take effect only if: (1) the Supreme Court of Palau issues a final ruling which sustains the August 29, 1987, certification that the Compact was approved pursuant to the Constitution of Palau; (2) the action is otherwise disposed of under Palauan law; or (3) the Compact is otherwise approved by the Government of Palau in a manner which satisfies the requirements of the Constitution and the Compact. Prohibits any officer or agent of the United States from paying or transferring any funds payable to the Government of Palau pursuant to the Act approving the Compact to any party other than such Government, except under the procedures established by the Compact and its related agreements. Prohibits using funds appropriated for assistance to Palau to satisfy any obligation or expense incurred by Palau prior to November 14, 1986, with respect to contracts or debts related to any electrical generating plant or related facilities which have not been specifically authorized by the Congress in advance, with exceptions."
