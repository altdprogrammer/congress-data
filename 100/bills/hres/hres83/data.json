Declares that the Department of State should bring the matter of the Soviet Union's nondelivery of international mail to the attention of other member countries to the Universal Postal Union. States that at the meeting of the Congress of the Universal Postal Union in Washington, D.C., in 1989, the U.S. delegation should ask such member countries to support the adoption of technical amendments to the Universal Postal Convention and to take such other measures that would encourage improved postal performance by the Soviet Union."
