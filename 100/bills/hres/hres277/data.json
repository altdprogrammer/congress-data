Urges the Secretary of State to take specified actions to encourage Soviet military withdrawal and a peaceful settlement of the situation in Afghanistan. Urges: (1) the Soviet Union to present a timetable for the withdrawal of its forces at any session of U.N.-sponsored indirect negotiations with Pakistan; and (2) the Government of Pakistan to resist Soviet pressure to accept less than such a timetable for withdrawal of such forces."
