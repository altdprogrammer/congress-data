Sets forth House procedure when such legislation is reported.

Requires the ratio of each select committee (and of each subcommittee, task force, or subunit) and of each conference committee to reflect the ratio of majority to minority party members at the time of its appointment. Amends rule XI to prohibit any committee from voting by proxy. Amends rule XV to require a roll call vote on any bill, joint resolution, or conference report making appropriations or providing revenue. Amends rule XXI to prohibit the consideration of any bill or resolution making appropriations under the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations if it applies to periods after November 30 of a fiscal year. Authorizes the waiver or suspension of such provision by a 60 percent majority vote of the House. Prohibits an appropriation from being reported in any joint resolution continuing appropriations, or from being an amendment to such resolution, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law, except to continue appropriations for public works and objects which are already in progress. Prohibits any provision changing existing law from being reported in any joint resolution continuing appropriations except germane provisions which retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill. Prohibits any amendment to a joint resolution continuing appropriations if it changes existing law. Declares that no amendment shall be in order during consideration of a joint resolution continuing appropriations proposing a limitation not specifically contained or authorized in existing law for the period of the limitation. Sets forth House floor procedure after a joint resolution continuing appropriations has been read for amendment. Makes it out of order in the House to consider any joint resolution continuing appropriations, or any amendment thereto, which covers a period of more than 90 calendar days. Prohibits any item of appropriation set forth in any joint resolution continuing appropriations from exceeding the lesser of the amount set forth for such item in the House-passed or Senate-passed general appropriation bill for the fiscal year. Declares that the provisions of this Act concerning the use of continuing resolutions may only be waived by a vote of two-thirds of the Members present and voting, a quorum being present. Amends rule XXVII to direct the Clerk of the House to have printed in the Congressional Record the name of each Member who has signed, or withdrawn a signature to, a motion to discharge a committee from the consideration of a public bill or resolution, when 100 Members have signed the motion. Amends rule XXVIII to provide for the inclusion of dissenting views in conference reports. Establishes rule LI to require the Speaker of the House to cause notice of the legislative schedule for the floor of the House for each legislative day to be printed in the Congressional Record at least two legislative days in advance. Establishes rule LII to require that the Congressional Record for the House contain an accurate and verbatim account of remarks actually delivered on the floor together with permitted tables, statistics, and other supporting data. Requires extensions and revisions of remarks to be limited to the correction of grammatical and typographical errors. Requires the insertion of remarks not actually delivered on the floor to be so designated."
