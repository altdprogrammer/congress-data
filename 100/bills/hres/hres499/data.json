Hastings, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, for high crimes and misdemeanors. Enumerates the articles of impeachment relating to: (1) a corrupt relationship with William Borders of Washington, D.C.; (2) repeated false testimony under oath at his criminal trial; (3) fabrication of false documents which were submitted as evidence in his criminal trial; and (4) improper disclosure of confidential information acquired by him as supervisory judge of a wiretap. States that such actions undermine the integrity of the judiciary and bring disrepute on the administration of justice by the Federal courts. States that Judge Hastings is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from office."
