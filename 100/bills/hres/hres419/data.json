Rept. 100-1054) Amends rule XXXVI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to revise its provisions concerning the preservation of noncurrent records of the House. Requires each congressional officer (Clerk, Sergeant-at-Arms, Doorkeeper, Postmaster, and Chaplain) to transfer to the Clerk any noncurrent records made or acquired in the course of such officer's duties. Declares that such records deposited at the National Archives and Records Administration are the permanent property of the House and remain subject to this rule and the orders of the House. Provides for the public disclosure of such records. Amends rule XI to require each committee to include in its rules standards for availability of records of the committee delivered to the Archivist under rule XXXVI. Requires such standards to include a requirement that nonavailability of a record for a period longer than the period otherwise applicable under that rule shall be approved by a separate vote of the committee. Authorizes the Committee on House Administration to report at any time on matters relating to preservation and availability of noncurrent records of the House under rule XXXVI."
