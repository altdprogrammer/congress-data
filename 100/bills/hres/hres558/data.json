Provides that interpretations under such requirement shall reflect the principles of current law as generally applicable to employment. Provides that such requirement does not prohibit the taking into consideration of: (1) the domicile of an individual with respect to a position under the clerk-hire allowance; or (2) the political affiliation of an individual with respect to a position under the clerk-hire allowance or a position on a committee staff. Sets forth a three-step procedure for consideration of alleged violations under this Act: (1) counseling and mediation; (2) formal complaint, hearing, and review by the Office of Fair Employment Practices; and (3) final review by the Review Panel. Establishes the Office of Fair Employment Practices. Sets forth the membership of the Review Panel. Provides for resolution by written agreement if, after a formal complaint is filed, the parties resolve the issues. Makes such agreements effective if approved by the Office or the Panel, whichever has the matter under review. Sets forth remedies which the Office or Panel may order. Provides for reimbursement of costs of attending hearings for individuals with respect to whom a hearing is held and who reside outside the District of Columbia.
