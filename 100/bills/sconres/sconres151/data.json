Declares that the Congress supports the President in his efforts to: (1) establish an international conference to end the use of chemical weapons; and (2) engage the Soviet Union in a bilateral initiative to eliminate the future use of such weapons. Encourages the President to use multilateral and unilateral methods to enforce a ban on the use of such weapons. Urges the President to direct the U.S. Ambasssador to the United Nations to present a resolution to the United Nations Security Council which: (1) condemns the use of chemical weapons; (2) acknowledges the damaging effect of such weapons on non-combatants; and (3) affirms that use of such weapons is a violation of human rights. Declares that the use of such weapons should be considered a terrorist act and that the Secretary of State should consider such use by any country in determining such country to be a terrorist country."
