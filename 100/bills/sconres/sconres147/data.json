States that: (1) there will be no resumption of regularized and sustained government-to-government assistance until the election of a civilian government pursuant to free, fair, and open elections; and (2) the appropriate executive branch officials should consult with the Congress before any kind of assistance is made available by the United States to the Government of Haiti. Declares support for the people of Haiti and their desire for democratic government and economic development. Directs the appropriate committees of the Congress to conduct hearings to determine appropriate and necessary legislative actions to promote free, fair, and open elections leading to civilian government in Haiti. States that the appropriate executive branch officials should examine ways that the United States can work with its allies and appropriate international organizations to develop a consistent and sustainable multilateral policy toward Haiti."
