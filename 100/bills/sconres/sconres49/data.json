Sets forth the levels and amounts of Federal revenues, budget outlays, and deficits for FY 1988 through 1991 for purposes of determining whether the maximum deficit amounts set forth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) have been exceeded. Recommends levels of Federal revenue of $680,300,000,000 for FY 1988, $726,800,000,000 for FY 1989, $790,800,000,000 for FY 1990, and $863,800,000,000 for FY 1991.

States that the amounts by which statutory limits on such debt should be increased are as follows: (1) $231,800,000,000 for FY 1988; (2) $218,500,000,000 for FY 1989; (3) $179,600,000,000 for FY 1990; and (4) $131,500,000,000 for FY 1991.

Sets forth the levels of budget authority, budget outlays, new direct obligations, new primary loan guarantee commitments, and new secondary loan guarantee commitments for each major functional category for FY 1988 through 1991. Requires the following Senate Committees to report changes in laws within their jurisdictions and make recommendations sufficient to reduce budget authority and outlays and make recommendations sufficient to reduce budget authority and outlays by specified amounts for FY 1988 through 1991: (1) Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; (2) Armed Services; (3) Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; (4) Commerce, Science, and Transportation; (5) Energy and Natural Resources; (6) Environment and Public Works; (7) Finance; (8) Governmental Affairs; (9) Labor and Human Resources; and (10) Veterans' Affairs. Requires the following House Committees to report changes in laws within their jurisdictions and make recommendations sufficient to reduce budget authority and outlays by specified amounts for FY 1988 through 1991: (1) Agriculture; (2) Armed Services; (3) Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs; (4) Education and Labor; (5) Energy and Commerce; (6) Government Operations; (7) Interior and Insular Affairs; (8) Post Office and Civil Service; (9) Veterans' Affairs; and (10) Ways and Means. Directs the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means to report changes in laws within the jurisdiction of such committees which are sufficient to increase revenues by specified amounts in FY 1988 through 1991. Directs the Budget Committees to report a reconciliation bill or resolution carrying out all such recommendations without substantive revisions. Prohibits an increase in defense spending levels for FY 1988 through 1991 unless: (1) a reconciliation bill is enacted; or (2) the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means provide that changes in laws to increase revenues shall not take effect unless the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations report legislation appropriating the full amount of the defense spending levels for FY 1988. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any determination with respect to whether a bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report would cause the maximum deficit amount for a fiscal year to be exceeded shall be based upon the same economic and technical assumptions as those used for the President's budget. Assumes that the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House would report legislation to establish a deficit reduction account in the Treasury into which revenues resulting from changes in laws reported by such Committees would be deposited and which would be used to retire outstanding U.S. debt obligations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Government generally should sell assets to non-governmental buyers but recommends no sales specifically. Describes the budgetary treatment of legislation authorizing the prepayment of certain Government loans. Provides for the allocation of budget authority and outlays for a reserve fund for FY 1988 through 1991 for: (1) the child care and job training initiative; and (2) the Medicare catastrophic health insurance initiative. Assumes that the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce would achieve Medicare savings without increasing premiums or deductibles or delaying eligibility or otherwise raising beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. Expresses the sense of the Senate that assumptions underlying the revenue levels provided for in this Act will not be achieved by either raising delaying the individual or corporate income tax rates provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the special needs of rural hospitals currently taken into account under the Medicare hospital prospective payment system should be taken into account in enacting legislation to reconcile Medicare Program expenditures with those required under the congressional concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1988 and subsequent years."
