Sets such amount at the lesser of: (1) the total (currently half of the total) amount of regular compensation, including dependents' allowances, payable to the individual during the individual's benefit year; or (2) 26 (currently 13) times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. Increases an individual's account by half (currently all) of the amount originally established in that account if it is exhausted at the time a State is in an extended benefit period."
