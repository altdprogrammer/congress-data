    "text": "Pesticide Maintenance Fees Authorization Act - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, with respect to the pesticide registration maintenance fee system, to: (1) make uniform the amount of the annual fee for each registration; (2) set maximum amounts payable by a registrant and an increased aggregate amount of collected fees for FY 2002 through 2006; (3) expand the definition of a small business; and (4) extend the authority to collect such fees and the prohibition on levy of fees other than those specified in the Act's fee provisions.Extends the requirement that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency use maintenance fees to ensure expedited processing of similar applications and adds a requirement that the fees be used to review inert ingredients.Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the Administrator, through FY 2006, from promulgating regulations addressing pesticide tolerance processing fees (except those changing current fee amounts by the same percentage as the annual adjustment to the Federal General Schedule pay scale)."
