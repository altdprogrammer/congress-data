    "text": "Dangerous Explosives Background Checks Requirement Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a person other than a Federal explosive materials licensee or permittee from knowingly: (1) transporting, shipping, causing to be transported, or receiving explosive materials (currently, in interstate or foreign commerce, and with a specified exception based on residency in a contiguous State); or (2) distributing explosive materials to any person other than such a licensee or permittee (currently, to any such person who the distributor knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the same State). Repeals provisions permitting distribution to a resident of the State where distribution is made and in which the licensee is licensed to do business or a State contiguous thereto if permitted by the law of the State of the purchaser's residence.Prohibits a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer from transferring explosive materials to a permittee unless specified conditions are met, including that: (1) before the completion of the transfer, the licensee contacts the national instant criminal background check system; and (2) either the system provides the licensee with a unique identification number or five days (on which State offices are open) have elapsed since the licensee contacted the system and the system has not notified the licensee that the receipt of explosive materials by the transferee would violate Federal law.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) penalties; (2) immunity from liability; (3) information to be supplied to individuals determined to be ineligible to receive explosive materials; and (4) the remedy for erroneous denial of explosive materials."
