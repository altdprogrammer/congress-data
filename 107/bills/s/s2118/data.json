Imposes penalties for export and import violations.Authorizes the EPA Administrator to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a research program in support of the POPs Convention. Requires reports to Congress concerning final exposure and health reassessment of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin and related compounds and describing a strategy to reduce exposure to persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances.Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to provide for the regulation of POPs pesticides (the substances listed in the first paragraph, above) and LRTAP POPs pesticides, including through registration and exemptions, controls on imports and exports, international cooperative efforts, certification statements, and notice and recording by the Administrator."
