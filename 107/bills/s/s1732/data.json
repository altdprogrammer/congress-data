    "text": "Economic Recovery and Assistance for American Workers Act of 2001 - Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001 - Permits any State to enter into and participate in an agreement with the Secretary of Labor for a temporary unemployment compensation (UC) program under which States receive Federal payments and State agencies pay: (1) temporary enhanced regular UC to individuals; and (2) temporary supplemental UC to individuals who have otherwise exhausted their rights to regular or temporary enhanced regular UC. Requires temporary enhanced regular UC to: (1) have an alternative base period; (2) not be denied to individuals who can show good cause for seeking or being available for only part-time employment; and (3) include increased benefits. Requires temporary supplemental UC accounts for eligible individuals who file applications for such UC. Limits an agreement entered into under this title to weeks of unemployment: (1) beginning after the date on which such agreement is entered into; and (2) ending before January 1, 2003.Sets forth health insurance coverage options for recently unemployed individuals and their families. Requires establishment of a temporary program under which 75 percent of the premium for COBRA continuation coverage for Medicaid be provided for any individual who: (1) is separated from employment at any time during the period from September 11, 2001, through December 31, 2002; and (2) is eligible for, and has elected coverage under, COBRA continuation coverage. (COBRA refers to title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, and concerns continuation of coverage by employee group health plans under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of1974.) Permits a State to elect to provide temporary Medicaid coverage (under title XIX of the Social Security Act) for individuals who: (1) are separated from employment at any time during the period that from September 11, 2001, through December 31, 2002; (2) are not eligible for COBRA continuation coverage; (3) are uninsured; and (4) do not have assets, resources, and earned or unearned income that exceed limitations set by the State.
