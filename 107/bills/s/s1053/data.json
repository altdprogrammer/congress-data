Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to include among its purposes the development of a hydrogen production methodology that minimizes greenhouse gas production, and the promotion of hydrogen as a major energy source.Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) report annually to Congress on programs and activities authorized under the Act; (2) give particular attention to developing an understanding and resolution of critical technical issues preventing the introduction of hydrogen into foreign markets, particularly where an energy infrastructure is not well developed; (3) require a cost-share commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 25 percent (currently 50 percent) of the cost of a hydrogen research project (with Secretarial discretion to reduce or eliminate such cost-share commitment, including the cost-share commitment for critical technology demonstrations).Directs the Secretary to conduct a hydrogen technology transfer program designed to accelerate wider application in foreign countries to increase the global market for hydrogen technologies and to foster global economic development without harmful environmental effects.Modifies guidelines for the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel to require: (1) between nine and 15 members; and (2) staggered three-year terms.Amends the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996, with respect to the integration of fuel cells with hydrogen production systems, to: (1) revise the general requirement for proposed projects to specify that they shall prove the feasibility of integrating fuel cells into Federal, State, and local government facilities for stationary and transportation applications; and (2) direct the Secretary to establish an interagency task force to develop an implementation plan that focuses upon development and demonstration of integrated systems and components for specified hydrogen-based production and uses."
