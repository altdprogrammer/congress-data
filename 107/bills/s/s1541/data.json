Includes among eligibility requirements an individual's not having rights, with respect to a week, to other compensation (including both regular and extended compensation). Reduces an individual TEUC account by the aggregate amount of any extended compensation for the same benefit year.Applies TEUC agreements to weeks of unemployment: (1) beginning on or after the first day of the first week after the date on which such agreement is entered into; and (2) ending before the date that is 18 months after enactment of this Act.Provides for a temporary reduction in the interest rate applicable to repayments of advances to State unemployment funds."
