    "text": "Campaign Finance Integrity Act of 2001 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to prohibit a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees from accepting aggregate contributions of which the aggregate amount of in-State or in-district contributions, as appropriate, is less than 50 percent of such total amount of contributions accepted.Prohibits a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees from accepting contributions used to pay campaign debt 90 days after a general or special election. Requires such candidate to assume such debt, after such time, as a personal obligation.Raises specified contribution limits in a general election for a candidate when an opponent and the opponent's authorized committee make certain aggregate expenditures from the opponent's personal funds. Requires a candidate's principal campaign committee to notify the Federal Election Commission (FEC) of certain excess aggregate expenditures made using the candidate's personal funds.Increases and indexes individual and multicandidate political committee contribution limits.Requires the disclosure of disbursements made by national political parties aggregating more than $1,000 made during a calendar year for certain political activities.Makes it unlawful, except with the separate, written, voluntary authorization of each individual, for: (1) national banks or corporations to collect or assess its stockholders or employees any dues, initiation fee, or other payment as a condition of employment or membership if any part of such dues, fee, or payment will be used for political activities in which the national bank or corporation is engaged; and (2) labor organizations to collect from or assess its members or nonmembers any dues, initiation fee, or other payment if any part of such dues, fee, or payment will be used for political activities.Requires disclosure by: (1) corporations or national banks to shareholders of the amount of each disbursement made for political activities or that otherwise influences Federal elections; and (2) labor organizations to dues paying members and nonmembers the amount of each disbursement made for political activities or that otherwise influences Federal elections. Requires corporations, national banks, and labor organizations to disclose to the FEC annual disbursements aggregating $1,000 or more for certain permissible activities.Revises requirements regarding filing of FECA reports and provisions regarding contributor information.Amends Federal postal law to repeal the current requirement regarding the mailing of any mass mailing as franked mail by Members of, or Members-elect to, the Congress. Replaces them with a requirement banning Members of, or Members-elect to, the Congress from mailing any mass mailing as franked mail."
