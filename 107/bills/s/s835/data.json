(Repeals the Act establishing the Wyandotte Wildlife Refuge.)Authorizes the Secretary to administer Refuge land and water in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (NWRSAA) and to use additional available authority for the conservation of fish and wildlife and for provision of fish- and wildlife-oriented recreational opportunities in the Refuge.Directs the Secretary to conserve, restore, and enhance the native aquatic and terrestrial community characteristics of the Detroit River.Requires the Refuge to be managed to: (1) protect the remaining high-quality fish and wildlife habitats of the Detroit River before they are lost to further development; (2) restore and enhance degraded wildlife habitats; (3) cooperate in international efforts to conserve, restore, and manage the fish and wildlife habitats associated with the Detroit River in the United States and Canada; and (4) encourage cooperation in facilitating partnerships among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Canadian national and provincial authorities, State and local governments, local communities in the United States and in Canada, conservation organizations, and other non-Federal entities to promote public awareness of the Detroit River resources.Requires the Secretary to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the Refuge is used for priority uses under: (1) NWRSAA; and (2) the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1998.Requires the Secretary to permit hunting and fishing on Federal land and water within the Refuge. Allows the Secretary to designate where and when such activities shall not be permitted.Allows the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with the State of Michigan, or any political subdivision thereof, and any other person or entity for the management of land or water owned by the State, political subdivision, or other person or entity within the Refuge; (2) promote public awareness of the Refuge's resources; and (3) encourage public participation in the conservation of those resources.Authorizes the Secretary to hold harmless, defend, and indemnify any person who donates real property within the Refuge against any claim or order that results from the release or threatened release of any hazardous substance on such real property if: (1) the State has determined that such property meets applicable State standards regarding the presence of such substance; and (2) after public review and comment, the Secretary determines that the acquisition of such property is in the public interest. Permits indemnification to be provided at the same time as the owner donates and transfers such real property to the United States. Allows the Secretary to require additional terms and conditions to protect U.S. interests.Authorizes appropriations."
