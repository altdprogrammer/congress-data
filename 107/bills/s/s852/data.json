Directs the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade and Development Agency similarly to support projects in Tibet consistent with such principles.Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) the release of, and access by humanitarian organizations to, Tibetan prisoners detained in China because of their political or religious beliefs; (2) the establishment of a United States branch office in Lhasa, Tibet; (3) U.S. support for economic development, cultural preservation, health care, and education and environmental sustainability for Tibetans inside Tibet; (4) Tibetan language training to U.S. foreign service officers assigned to the consulate in China; (5) Tibet considerations at the United Nations; and (6) the end of religious persecution in Tibet."
