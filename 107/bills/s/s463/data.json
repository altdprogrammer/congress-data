    "text": "Global Access to AIDS Treatment Act of 2001 - Declares it is U.S. policy that the United States will not seek the revocation or revision of intellectual property or competition laws or policies that regulate pharmaceuticals or medical technologies used to treat HIV/AIDS in any foreign country undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis (sub-Saharan Africa and any other country determined by the President to be going through such crisis) if such foreign country's laws or policies: (1) promote access to such pharmaceuticals or technologies for affected populations; and (2) provide intellectual property protection consistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.Urges the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to: (1) carry out HIV/AIDS activities in foreign countries that are undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis; and (2) lead the international organization of the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals or medical technologies for HIV/AIDS, and the global registration of such products.Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to exempt, with respect to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies, any foreign country that is undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis, and is implementing laws or policies that regulate pharmaceuticals or medical technologies used to treat HIV/AIDS, from certain provisions declaring that a foreign country may be determined to deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights even though it may be in compliance with the Agreement. Declares that such country shall be construed to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights if its laws or policies promote access to such pharmaceuticals or technologies for their affected populations or within other countries undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis. Directs the President to instruct the United States Trade Representative not to seek the revocation or revision of such laws or policies.Provides for the development and implementation of: (1) simplified and adapted protocols for the delivery of HIV/AIDS treatments in the resource-poor settings of the developing world; (2) programs to strengthen and broaden health care systems infrastructure, and the capacity of health care systems in developing foreign countries to deliver HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals; and (3) a database of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals.Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the Foreign HIV/AIDS Assistance Loan Repayment Program to encourage physicians and other specified health professionals to provide HIV/AIDS treatment and care in developing foreign countries. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay or defer up to $5,000 for graduate education loans provided to an individual under such program for each year of the individual's obligated service in providing HIV/AIDS-related services in a developing foreign country."
