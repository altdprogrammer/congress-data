Requires the Secretary to invest in such obligations the portion of such Funds not required to meet current withdrawals.Directs the Secretary, beginning the same day as such transfer, to withdraw the aggregate amount of interest deposited into the Funds each fiscal year and transfer it to the Secretary of the Interior for making payments to the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe for carrying out projects and programs under their respective Tribal Plan.(Sec. 106) Directs the tribal council of each Tribe to prepare a Tribal Plan for using payments to carry out projects and programs to promote: (1) economic development; (2) infrastructure development; or (3) the educational, health, recreational, and social welfare objectives of the Tribe and its members. Prohibits per capita distributions to Tribe members.(Sec. 107) States that payments under this Act shall not affect other Federal services or programs to which the Tribes are otherwise entitled, or the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin power rates, nor be subject to Federal or State income tax.(Sec. 109) Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 110) Extinguishes all monetary claims of the Tribes against the United States for loss of value or use of land resulting from the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program upon the Secretary's transfers to the tribal Funds established by this Act.Title II: Martin's Cove Land Transfer - Martin's Cove Land Transfer Act - (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to offer to convey to the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop specified public lands (Martin's Cove in Natrona County, Wyoming) for the purposes of public education, historic preservation, and enhanced recreational enjoyment of the public. Requires the Corporation to pay the United States the historic fair market value of the property conveyed, including any improvements.Directs the Secretary and the Corporation to enter into an agreement, binding on any successor or assignee, that ensures that the property conveyed shall, consistent with the site's historic purposes: (1) be available in perpetuity for public education and historic preservation; and (2) provide to the public, in perpetuity and without charge, access to the property.Directs the Secretary to require that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and its current or future affiliated corporations grant the United States a right of first refusal to acquire the property at historic fair market value if the Church or any of its corporations seeks to dispose of it.Requires that the proceeds of this conveyance be used exclusively by the National Trails Interpretive Center Foundation, Inc. of Casper, Wyoming, to advance the public understanding and enjoyment of the National Historic Trails System. Requires the Foundation to use such proceeds only to: (1) complete construction of the exhibits connected with the opening of the National Historic Trails Center; and (2) maintain, acquire, and further enhance the Center's exhibits, artistic representations, historic artifacts, and grounds.States that this title does not set a precedent for the resolution of land sales between or among private entities and the United States."
