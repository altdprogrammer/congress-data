    "text": "Choice IDEA Act - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to allow States to opt to use part B special education program funds to carry out a parental choice program, as an alternative to opting for the current part B program.Requires such a choice program to include vouchers for parents of children with disabilities. Permits parents to use vouchers to: (1) obtain special education and related services, selected from a menu by the parent, for the child at a public school; or (2) pay the child's attendance cost at a public or private school.Directs the Secretary of Education to award grants to States that do not participate in the choice program, for subgrants to local educational agencies in which 15 percent or more of the students served are children with disabilities, to help defray the salaries of individuals who help with paperwork associated with receiving part B funds.Extends through FY 2010 the authorization of appropriations, in specified increasing amounts, for IDEA part B programs of assistance for education of all children with disabilities."
