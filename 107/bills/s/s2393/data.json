    "text": "Mental Health Patients' Rights Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow a health insurance issuer to impose a preexisting condition exclusion relating to a preexisting mental condition only if: (1) such exclusion relates to a condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the six-month period ending on the enrollment date; (2) such exclusion extends for no more than 12 months after the enrollment date; and (3) the exclusion period is reduced by the aggregate periods of creditable coverage applicable to the individual or dependent as of the enrollment date.Prohibits any such issuer from requiring an individual or dependent with a preexisting mental health condition to pay a premium or contribution which is greater than that charged to an individual without such condition when the additional charge is based solely on such preexisting condition.Defines `preexisting mental health condition' to mean a mental health condition, including all categories of mental health conditions listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM IV-TR), or the most recent edition if different than the Fourth Edition, that was present before the date of enrollment of such coverage, whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before such date."
