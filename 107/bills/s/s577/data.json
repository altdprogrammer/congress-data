Waives such requirement for a limited period if an entity's solvency is in jeopardy or compliance would cause the entity's failure to meet State solvency requirements. Includes Medicaid managed care organizations and managed care entities providing health care coverage for Federal employees and members of the armed forces within the definition of \"managed care entity.\"Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop related investigation and compliance procedures.Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to apply the requirements of this Act to Medicare+Choice organizations.Sets forth noncompliance remedies."
