    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2001-05-17", 
    "text": "Endangered Species Recovery Act of 2001 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (the Act) to direct the Secretary of the Interior, when required to use the best scientific and commercial data available in the determination of a species for inclusion on the endangered or threatened list, to use data that are empirical or that have been field-tested or peer-reviewed. Modifies the factors considered for such listings. Repeals a provision requiring the Secretary, concurrently with making such a determination, to designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat.Rewrites the Act to: (1) provide for a change of status of a species from a previous determination (currently limited to petitions to add or remove a species) and to require specified minimum documentation; (2) require (when requested) at least one public hearing to be held in each State that would be affected by a proposed regulation concerning a determination or change in status; and (3) require publication of relevant information regarding the status of the affected species. Provides for independent scientific review of a determination that a species is endangered or threatened.Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a conservation agreement with one or more States for a species that has been proposed for listing, is a candidate species, or is likely to become a candidate species in the near future. Creates a Freedom of Information Act exemption when the release of data regarding the location of a threatened or endangered species would likely result in an increased taking of the species.Sets forth requirements and schedules by which the Secretary shall develop and implement a recovery plan for each endangered and threatened species indigenous to the United States unless the Secretary finds that a plan will not promote species conservation or that there already exists a recovery plan for that species.Requires Federal agencies to: (1) maintain an inventory of endangered or threatened species located on agency owned or controlled land or water; and (2) meet specified consultation requirements before commencing an action that may affect such a species..Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with non-Federal persons to benefit the conservation of endangered or threatened species by creating, restoring, or improving habitat or by maintaining currently unoccupied habitat for such species. Directs the Secretary to establish a habitat reserve program. Establishes a Habitat Conservation Planning Loan Program and a Habitat Conservation Insurance Program.Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a private property owners education and technical assistance program."
