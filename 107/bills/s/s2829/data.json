Covers any disclosure of information without restriction to time, place, form, motive, or context, or prior disclosure made to any person by an employee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of any employee's duties, that the employee or applicant reasonably believes is evidence of any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or other specified misconduct.Allows a presumption relating to the performance of a duty by an employee to be rebutted by substantial evidence.Permits representation by attorneys for the Office of the Special Counsel in civil actions brought in connection with such disclosures of information or provisions relating to political activities. Allows the Special Counsel to obtain judicial review of any final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board with respect to a case concerning such a disclosure or provision.Requires each non-disclosure policy, form, or agreement to contain a statement that the restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede specified employee obligations, rights, or liabilities."
