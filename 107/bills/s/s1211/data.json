    "text": "Renewable Energy Production Incentive Reform Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to modify renewable energy production incentive payment guidelines to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from establishing criteria or procedures that have the effect of assigning to incentive payment applications a higher or lower priority for eligibility or allocation of appropriated funds on the basis of the energy source proposed.Redefines a qualified renewable energy facility as one: (1) owned by certain tax-exempt electricity-generating cooperatives, certain public utilities, governmental entities, or an Indian tribal government; and (2) which may involve electricity generation by landfill gas or incremental hydropower. Repeals the requirement that a facility be owned by a State or local government or instrumentality, or by a nonprofit electrical cooperative.Extends through FY 2013 the deadline for first use of a facility eligible for incentive payments."
