    "text": "Aircraft Clean Air Act of 2001 - Authorizes crew members or passengers that experience an aircraft air quality incident which results in their reporting a symptom consistent with exposure to neurotoxins or asphyxiants to file a request with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for: (1) the aircraft's mechanical and maintenance records; (2) the filtration media used in the aircraft's air supply system; and (3) the chemical constituents of products used in the maintenance, operation, or treatment of such aircraft to which a crew member or passenger may have been directly exposed. Sets forth a civil penalty for the failure of an air carrier to produce such records, media, or information.Directs the Administrator of the FAA to award a grant for an aeromedical research study to determine what cabin altitude must be maintained to provide sufficient oxygen to ensure that the short- and long-term health of 95 percent of a representative sample of cabin crew and passengers is not adversely affected."
