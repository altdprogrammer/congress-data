    "text": "Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act - Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to establish a pilot program under which specified Federal agencies may agree to repay the student loans of their employees employed in national security positions. Requires the Director to coordinate such program with such agencies to recruit employees to serve in such positions.Requires the Director to establish a program for awarding National Security Fellowships to eligible graduate students who agree to employment with the Federal Government in national security positions. Establishes a National Security Service Board to: (1) develop criteria for awarding such Fellowships; (2) provide for the wide dissemination of information regarding the activities assisted under the program; (3) work with the Director in hiring and placing fellows in national security positions; and (4) develop and provide to Congress a strategic plan that identifies the skills needed by the Federal national security workforce. Provides that 20 percent of such Fellowships be set-aside for Federal employees who are working in such positions to enhance their education and training in areas important to national security.Creates a National Security Service Corps, under the direction of the Board, to provide rotational opportunities for mid-level employees in national security positions within and between specified agencies.Requires agencies' annual strategic and performance plans and program performance reports to evaluate the role of specific skills in accomplishing or failing to accomplish such agencies' goals."
