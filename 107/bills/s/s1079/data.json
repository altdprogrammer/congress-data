Allows inclusions of sites otherwise excluded from consideration: (1) on a site-by-site basis if financial assistance will protect human health and the environment and promote economic development or facilitate the protection of parks, greenways, or other property used for nonprofit purposes or promote eco-industrial development; (2) that were contaminated by a controlled substance; (3) that are certain low-risk petroleum-contaminated sites; or (4) that are mine-scarred land. Defines eco-industrial development as development conducted in a manner in which businesses cooperate with each other and the local community to efficiently share resources with the goals of economic gains, improved environmental quality, and equitable enhancement of human resources in business and local communities.Authorizes appropriations."
