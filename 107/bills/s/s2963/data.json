Requires the Secretary to appoint a Director of Independent Review who shall appoint independent review panels as appropriate. Prohibits project review costs from exceeding $250,000.Sets forth requirements for project fish and wildlife mitigation concurrently with project construction and as part of project plans and proposals. Prohibits the Secretary from recommending or selecting a project alternative unless its mitigation plan has a high probability of mitigating adverse impacts on aquatic and other resources, hydrologic functions, and fish and wildlife. Requires the Secretary to establish a mitigation tracking system for each project constructed, operated, or maintained by the Secretary and for each permit issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.Expresses the intent of Congress that economic development and environmental protection and restoration to be coequal goals of water resources planning and development."
