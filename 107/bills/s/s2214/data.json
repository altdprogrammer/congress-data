Excludes punitive damages from compensation. Reduces compensation by the amount of collateral source compensation received, or expected to be received, by claimant as a result of the bombing.Determines submission of a claim to be a waiver of a claimant's right to file a civil action (or to be party to an action) in any Federal or State court for damages sustained as a result of the bombing.Directs the Attorney General and Special Master to promulgate certain regulations related to carrying out the Act including procedures for hearings and presentation of evidence.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include victims of the February 26, 1993, World Trade Center attack under Code provisions exempting terrorist victims from certain tax liabilities. Allows for a refund or credit which would otherwise be prevented before the close of the one-year period following enactment of the Act, provided the claim is filed before the close of such period."
