    "text": "Tobacco-Dependent Communities Assistance Act of 2002 - Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture, upon making specified determinations, to establish three-year national production poundage permits for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco, unless disapproved in successive referenda by active growers.Directs the Secretary to establish a tobacco equity reduction program for quota owners and growers of Flue-cured and Burley quota tobacco.Expresses the sense of Congress that quota owners and growers of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco should be able to invest tobacco equity payments in investment retirement accounts.Terminates marketing quotas for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco.Revises provisions regarding: (1) lease and transfer of acreage allotments; and (2) national marketing quota deadlines and apportionment; (3) poundage quotas; (4) purchase intention deadlines for cigarette manufacturers; (5) production and marketing information; (6) quota adjustments; (7) eminent domain; and (8) reconstitution of farms.Repeals provisions providing for mandatory sale of Burley and Flue-cured tobacco acreage allotments and marketing quotas.Prohibits Federal promotion of manufactured tobacco products.Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to revise tobacco price support provisions. States that the price support rate for each type of tobacco shall reflect annual production costs. Eliminates references to quota tobacco in the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund and No Net Cost Tobacco Account.Amends the Tobacco Inspection Act to apply the provisions of such Act to nonauction tobacco sales.Amends the Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983 regarding tobacco inspections.Establishes a tobacco worker transition program under which a group of workers (including workers in any firm, or subdivision, involved in the manufacture, processing, or warehousing of tobacco or tobacco products) may apply for adjustment assistance if the Secretary of Labor determines that a significant number or proportion of the workers have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and: (1) sales or production of such firm have decreased; and (2) implementation of the national tobacco settlement contributed importantly to such workers' separation and to the firm's decline in sales or production.Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a farmer opportunity grant program of higher education assistance for qualifying members of tobacco farm families.Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to direct the Secretary to make grants to tobacco-growing States in order to carry out economic development initiatives in tobacco-growing communities.Exempts an active tobacco producer, tobacco-related growers association, or tobacco warehouse owner or employee from Federal or State liability resulting from the failure of any tobacco product manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to comply with national tobacco settlement legislation.Prohibits an officer or employee of the Food and Drug Administration from entering a leaf tobacco farm without the written consent of the producer."
