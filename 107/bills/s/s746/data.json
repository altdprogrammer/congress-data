Extends Federal recognition to the government as the representative governing body of the Native Hawaiian people upon election of officers and certification by the Secretary.(Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 8) Reaffirms the delegation by the United States of authority to the State of Hawaii to address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of Hawaii. Permits the United States, upon Federal recognition of the Native Hawaiian government, to enter into an agreement with the State and such government regarding the transfer of lands, resources, and assets dedicated to Native Hawaiian use."
