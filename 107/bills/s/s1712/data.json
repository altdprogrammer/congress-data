Lists exceptions, such as where a class action brought by shareholders solely involves a claim concerning a covered security or relating to the internal governance of a corporation.Sets forth procedures for removal of interstate class actions to U.S. district court and for review of orders remanding class actions to State courts.Directs the Judicial Conference of the United States to report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on class action settlements."
