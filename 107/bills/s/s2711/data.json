Subjects intestate succession of any interest in trust or restricted land to the appropriate tribal probate code approved in accordance with applicable Federal law relating to the devise or descent of trust or restricted property (thus preempting State law).Defines acquired interest as one acquired by a decedent by any means other than devise or inheritance, or through devise or inheritance, if: (1) the decedent acquired additional undivided interests in the same parcel as the interest, by a means other than devise or inheritance, or acquired land adjoining the parcel of land that includes the interest; or (2) the parcel of land that includes the interest includes the decedent's spouse's residence.Provides for intestate succession in the following order for an acquired interest or any other interest in trust or restricted land to which a tribal probate code does not apply: (1) the decedent's surviving Indian spouse; (2) the decedent's surviving non-Indian spouse as a life estate, with the remainder to the decedent's heirs of the first or second degree; (3) the decedent's Indian collateral heir (aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, and first cousin) who is a co-owner of the interest; or (4) the Indian tribe that exercises jurisdiction over the land.Provides for the intestate succession of Indian trust or restricted land as devise or inheritance interest in the following order: (1) the surviving Indian heir of the first or second degree; (2) the decedent's Indian spouse; (3) the decedent's Indian collateral heir (aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, and first cousin) who is a co-owner of the interest; or (4) the Indian tribe that exercises jurisdiction over the land.Provides for intestate succession of Indian trust or restricted land for pretermitted spouses and pretermitted children.

Waives the tribe's right to acquire such an interest if the devisee (who is a member of the decedent's family) agrees that the tribe will have the opportunity to acquire the interest for fair market value if the interest is offered for sale to an entity that is not a member of the landowner's family.Declares with respect to joint tenancy interests that: (1) nothing shall be construed to alter the ability of the owner of such an interest to convey a life estate in the owner's undivided joint tenancy interest; and (2) only the last remaining owner of such an interest may devise or convey more than a life estate in such an interest.

Requires in such a case, however, that the tribe be afforded an opportunity to purchase the interest if it is offered for sale to an entity that is not a family member of the landowner.Chapter 2: Inheritance of Certain Trust or Restricted Lands - (Sec. 9221) Amends Federal law to allow the devise of an interest in trusts or restricted Indian lands within the States of North Dakota and South Dakota and within the original exterior boundaries of the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation that is less than two-and-one-half acres to: (1) not more than one tribal member; or (2) more than one tribal member if each additional tribal member already holds an interest to such land.Provides that any interest in such trusts or restricted Indian lands that is less than two and one half acres that would otherwise pass by intestate succession, or is devised to more than one tribal member (where each additional tribal member does not already hold an interest to such land) will escheat to the tribe and be held in trust by the United States.Requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide notice to owners of trusts or restricted lands within the Lake Travers Reservation of the enactment of this subtitle.Subtitle C: Settlement of Certain Foreign Claims - (Sec. 9301) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada a specified amount from certain appropriations for final judgments, awards, compromise settlements, and interest and costs specified in judgment awards in accordance with the Stipulation for Recommendation of Settlement dated May 22, 2000, entered into between the Nation and the United States.Subtitle D: Certification of Rental Proceeds - Declares that any rental proceeds from the lease of land acquired under loans from the Farmers Home Administration Direct Loan Account to Indian tribes shall constitute the rental and appraisal value of the land.Subtitle E: Tribal Sovereignty - Amends Federal law to declare that each Indian Tribe shall retain sovereign power to adopt governing documents."
