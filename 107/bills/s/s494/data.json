Directs the Secretary to instruct such U.S. executive directors to oppose such assistance to Zimbabwe until such certification is made. Authorizes the President to waive such requirements if it is in the national interest of the United States.(Sec. 5) Authorizes the President to provide certain foreign assistance funds to Zimbabwe to support the establishment of democratic institutions, free press and independent media, and the rule of law. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002.(Sec. 6) Urges the President to consult immediately with the governments of European Union member states, Canada, and other appropriate foreign countries on identifying and imposing travel and economic sanctions against individuals responsible for the breakdown of the rule of law, politically motivated violence, and intimidation in Zimbabwe."
