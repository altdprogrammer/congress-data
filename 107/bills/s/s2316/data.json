Council approval of contracts exceeding $1 million during a one-year period.Amends the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 to direct the CFO to: (1) establish a reporting event notification system to monitor the financial performance of the District government, economic trends in the Washington metropolitan area, and other factors affecting the District's financial stability; (2) make a determination, based on such factors, as to whether an event is likely to occur which will result in the initiation of a control period if the District does not take certain actions to respond to the event; and (3) notify the Mayor and Congress upon such determination. Requires the Mayor to develop an action plan to respond to an event upon such a notification.Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) the enactment of the District's budget without congressional approval; (2) the hiring of employees if the positions are authorized by the D.C. Council (currently, only by an Act of Congress); and (3) repeal of specified Federal authority over the District's budget-making process."
