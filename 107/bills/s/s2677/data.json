Requires the Medicaid Drug Use Review Program to provide for the distribution of generic drug samples of covered outpatient drugs to prescribers.Addresses the relationship between prices charged for inpatient drugs at certain public hospitals and the best price exemptions established for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.Requires that the national drug code for each drug be made available upon the publication of the upper payment limits for multiple source drugs under Medicaid."
