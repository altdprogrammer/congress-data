(The consumptive demand exception allows importation of such prohibited goods if similar goods are not sufficiently produced in the United States to meet U.S. consumer demand.) Directs the Commissioner of Customs to report to Congress on products made by convict labor or/and forced labor or/and indentured labor, including such products made by convict, forced, or indentured child labor that are destined for U.S. markets."
