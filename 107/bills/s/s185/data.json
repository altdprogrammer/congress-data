Permits early release only by approval of the Governor after a public hearing during which representatives of the public, the victims of the crime, and the law enforcement agencies from the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed have had an opportunity to be heard.Requires the total amount from reductions under this Act to be allocated to each eligible State that has enacted such a statute."
