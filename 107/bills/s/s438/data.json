    "text": "Teacher Quality Act of 2001 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions for the renamed Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Education.Includes language arts and social studies (as well as mathematics and science) among the education subjects for which the Clearinghouse carries on certain activities. Requires the Clearinghouse to: (1) gather qualitative and evaluative materials and programs; (2) review and rank materials and programs on the basis of such evaluations; and (3) distribute review results to teachers in an easily accessible form. Prohibits the Clearinghouse from directly conducting an evaluation of the materials or programs. Directs the Clearinghouse, in reviewing evaluations of materials and programs, to give particular attention to the effective use of education technology in mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies.Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to State educational agencies for mentoring programs for beginning teachers. Requires, under such programs, that public elementary or secondary school teachers with more than three years of teaching experience serve as mentor teachers to teachers with less than three years of such experience. Bases the amounts of such grants on the relative numbers of elementary and secondary school students in each State.Establishes an allotment program to assist States to develop and implement programs for alternative routes to teacher certification or licensure requirements, in order to increase the supply of well-qualified elementary school and secondary school teachers.Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish teacher training facilities for elementary and secondary school teachers.Requires an LEA, as a grant condition, to enter into a partnership contract with a nongovernmental organization to establish such a teacher training facility."
