    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Defense to report annually to Congress on waivers from the Buy American limitations for goods or services procured by or for the Department of Defense, as set forth under the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1993, that were granted for procurements made by the Defense Logistics Agency for the military departments.Requires, at least 14 days before granting each waiver, that the Secretary notify the Secretary of the military department concerned of the determination to waive such limitations. Allows the Secretary to waive such notification when a delay of the procurement is not consistent with the need to expedite the procurement in the U.S. national security interest.Requires the Secretary to establish a system for: (1) monitoring the granting of such waivers; and (2) recording the waivers and the reasons therefor."
