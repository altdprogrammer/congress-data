Defines genetic services as health services provided for genetic education and counseling.Prohibits group health plans or health insurers offering group coverage from using genetic information to impose enrollment restrictions or adjust group premiums. Prohibits requests for genetic testing or results except as necessary for treatment, payment, or health care operations.Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit such discrimination in coverage offered in the individual market.Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue final regulations, coordinating with the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor through an interagency memorandum of understanding.Makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or training program to discriminate against an individual or deprive such individual of employment opportunities because of genetic information. Prohibits the collection of genetic information except where necessary to monitor the effects of toxic substances in the workplace when authorized by the employee, or as required by law.Requires genetic information to be treated as part of an individual's confidential medical record, limiting disclosure to the individual, the family, health researchers, or as required by law or court order.Grants enforcement powers to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
