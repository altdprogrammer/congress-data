Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use $134,000,000 of such amount to compute an allotment, according to a specified formula, for each of the 17 States with the highest number of undocumented aliens. Directs the Secretary to use $66,000,000 to compute an allotment for each of the six States with the highest number of undocumented alien apprehensions. Permits a State to receive funds on both accounts. Allows funds to go to States, local governments, hospitals, or other providers in a State, including providers of services received through an Indian Health Service facility (presently funds go only to States).Declares that this Act constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts."
