    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "2001-04-02", 
    "text": "Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 - Title I: Reduction of Special Interest Influence - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) with respect to soft money to prohibit: (1) a national committee of a political party (including specified related entities) from soliciting or receiving contributions or making expenditures not subject to FECA; (2) a national, State, district, or local committee of a political party from soliciting or donating funds to a tax-exempt organization; and (3) a candidate or an incumbent for Federal office from soliciting or receiving funds not subject to FECA, or from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring, or spending funds in connection with any election other than an election for Federal office, or disbursing funds in connection with such an election unless the funds are not in excess of permitted amounts, and are not from prohibited sources.(Sec. 101) Exempts from the latter prohibition the solicitation, receipt, or spending of funds by a candidate for a State or local office if it is permitted under State law for any non-Federal election activity that refers to a clearly identified candidate for election to Federal office. Requires a State, district, or local committee of a political party to make expenditures or disbursements (with exceptions) for specified Federal election activities from funds subject to FECA. Limits to funds subject to FECA any amount spent by national, State, district, and local committees to raise funds used to pay the costs of a Federal election activity.(Sec. 102) Establishes an individual annual limit of $10,000 for contributions by a State committee. Increases the aggregate individual contribution limit from $25,000 to $30,000.(Sec. 103) Requires national and State committees to report all receipts and disbursements. Repeals the building fund exception to the definition of contribution (thus extending FECA coverage to contributions to a national or State committee building fund for office facilities not acquired to influence the election of particular candidates).Title II: Noncandidate Campaign Expenditures - Subtitle A: Electioneering Communications - Amends FECA to: (1) require every person who makes a disbursement for electioneering communications exceeding $10,000 in the aggregate during any calendar year to file with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) a statement containing specified information; (2) treat a disbursement for any broadcast electioneering communication that is coordinated with a candidate (or his or her authorized committee), a Federal, State, or local political party or committee, as a contribution to the candidate supported by the electioneering communication or that candidate's party and as an expenditure by that candidate or that candidate's party; and (3) set forth special operating rules prohibiting corporate and labor disbursements for electioneering communications and special rules relating to certain targeted electioneering communications.Subtitle B: Independent and Coordinated Expenditures - Amends FECA to define the term \"independent expenditure\" as an expenditure: (1) by a person expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate; and (2) that is not a coordinated activity with the candidate or the candidate's agent or a person who has engaged in coordinated activity with such candidate or such candidate's agent.(Sec. 212) Revises independent expenditure reporting requirements.(Sec. 213) Prohibits a party from making both independent and coordinated expenditures with respect to a candidate during the same election cycle.(Sec. 214) Treats a coordinated expenditure or disbursement as a contribution.Title III: Miscellaneous - Amends FECA to revise provisions on permitted and prohibited uses of contributed amounts by candidates and incumbents for certain purposes. Specifies prohibited kinds of conversion of such funds to personal use.(Sec. 302) Amends the Federal criminal code to revise the prohibition against fundraising on Federal property. Prohibits an officer or employee of the Federal Government, including the President, Vice President, and Members of Congress from soliciting from any person a donation of money or other thing of value in connection with a Federal, State, or local election, while in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties by an officer or employee of the United States. Establishes criminal penalties for violations. Excepts from the prohibition contributions received in certain circumstances by the staff of the Executive Office of the President.(Sec. 303) Amends FECA to extend to donations the ban on contributions by foreign nationals.(Sec. 304) Increases individual contribution limits if the opposition personal funds amount with respect to a candidate for election to the office of Senator exceeds the threshold amount determined in accordance with a specified formula.(Sec. 305) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 with regard to television media rates, to provide that the charges made for the use of any television broadcast station, or by a provider of cable or satellite television service, to any person who is legally qualified candidate for any public office in connection with the campaign of such candidate for nomination for election, or election, to such office shall not exceed the lowest charge of the station for the same amount of time for the same period.(Sec. 306) Requires any Federal candidate to meet specified content requirements for television and radio broadcasts in order to be entitled to receive the lowest unit broadcast rate.
