    "text": "Health Care for Working Families Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to establish a new title II, Health Benefits for Employees and Their Families.Requires employers with 100 or more employees (large employers) to: (1) offer employees the opportunity to enroll in a qualifying health benefit plan that provides family coverage; (2) contribute at least 75 percent of the plan premium; and (3) withhold the employee's share from wages. Applies such requirements to smaller employers that perform a majority of their services for a single large employer. Considers contract, leased, and temporary workers as employees. Provides a formula for determining an alternative minimum employer contribution for plan coverage of part-time workers (who work less than 30 but no less than ten hours per week).Requires such qualifying health plans to provide benefits that are actuarially equivalent or greater in value than those under the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Standard Plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program as of January 1, 2002.Amends the Public Health Service Act to require health insurance issuers to ensure that any employee health insurance coverage they offer to employers complies with requirements of title II of FLSA."
