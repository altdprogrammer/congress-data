Requires that providers of location-based services: (1) inform customers about their policies on the collection, use, disclosure of, and access to customer location information; and (2) receive a customer's express authorization before collecting, using, retaining, or disclosing such information. Outlines permitted uses of such information. Directs the FCC to specify appropriate methods by which a customer may provide express prior authorization for the use of such information. Preempts State and local requirements with respect to the privacy of wireless location information."
