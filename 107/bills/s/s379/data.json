Requires the Commission also to recommend how the Federal Government can, on a permanent basis, best provide ongoing assistance to State and local authorities to improve administering elections, which existing or new Federal agency should provide such assistance, and what levels of funding will be necessary.Directs the Attorney General to develop and publish a plan to award and disburse annual Federal Election Modernization Grants to States and localities."
