    "text": "United States-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act - Approves the Agreement between the United States of America and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area (Agreement), entered into on October 24, 2000, and submitted to Congress on January 6, 2001.Title I: Tariff Modifications; Rules of Origin - Authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of duty, continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or additional duties as are deemed necessary or appropriate to carry out the Agreement between the United States of America and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area (Agreement), entered into on October 24, 2000. Sets forth certain rules of origin with respect to the reduction or elimination of any duty imposed by the United States on Jordanian textile, fabric, or apparel articles as provided in such Agreement.Title II: Relief From Imports - Subtitle A: General Provisions - Defines specified terms.Subtitle B: Relief From Imports Benefitting From the Agreement - Directs the International Trade Commission (ITC), upon the filing of a petition by an entity (including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers representative of an industry) requesting trade relief from U.S. obligations under the Agreement (or alleging that critical circumstances exist), to initiate an investigation to determine whether, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the Agreement, a Jordanian article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities and under such conditions that such imports alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the imported article. Prescribes a procedure for ITC action on such a petition. Requires the President, upon an affirmative determination by the ITC, to provide necessary import relief (including suspension of any further duty reduction, or an increase in the rate duty, on imported Jordanian articles under the Agreement) and facilitate domestic industry efforts to make a positive adjustment to import competition, unless the provision of such relief is not in the U.S. national economic interest, or in extraordinary circumstances, the provision of relief would cause serious harm to U.S. national security.Subtitle C: Cases Under Title II of the Trade Act of 1974 - Requires the ITC, if an affirmative determination about import competition has been made under the Trade Act of 1974, also to find whether imports of Jordanian articles are a substantial cause of serious injury or threat. Requires the President to review such a determination, and authorizes exclusion of such Jordanian imports from remedial action if the final determination is negative.Title III: Temporary Entry - Authorizes a Jordanian national (including any spouse or child, if accompanying or following to join such national) to enter the United States pursuant to the Agreement as a nonimmigrant if such entrance is solely to carry on substantial trade, or solely to develop the operations of an enterprise in which he has invested a substantial amount of capital.Title IV: General Provisions - Declares that U.S. law shall supercede any inconsistent Agreement provisions.(Sec. 402) Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year after FY 2001 to the Department of Commerce for the payment of the U.S. share of expenses incurred in dispute settlement proceedings under the Agreement."
