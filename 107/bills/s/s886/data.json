Authorizes such grants to be used by such agencies to integrate information technologies or to establish, develop, or upgrade automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with standards established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and interoperable with systems operated by States and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
