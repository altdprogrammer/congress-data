Exempts an air operator that meets such requirements from certain operational flight allocations. Provides for the reinstatement of any air tour route from Clark County, Nevada, to the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, Tusayan, Arizona, that has been eliminated or altered on or after a specified date."
