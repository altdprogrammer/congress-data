Directs the Secretary of Labor to apply for appointment, and carry out specified duties, as trustee of any such insolvent association health plans which provide health benefits in addition to health insurance coverage.Allows a State to impose a contribution tax on any association health plan commencing operations in such State after the enactment of this Act.Requires association health plans to include in their summary plan descriptions, in connection with each benefit option, a description of the form of any solvency or guarantee fund protection secured under ERISA or applicable State law.Revises requirements relating to treatment of: (1) single employer arrangements; and (2) certain collectively bargained arrangements.Sets forth requirements for association health plans with respect to: (1) enforcement; (2) cooperation between Federal and State authorities; and (3) treatment of certain existing health benefit programs."
