Authorizes the Attorney General to commence a civil action to enjoin a violation.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict areas of biomedical and agricultural research or practices not expressly prohibited, including nuclear transplantation to produce human stem cells or to create nonhuman animals.Subjects to forfeiture any real or personal property derived from or used to commit a violation.Directs the Attorney General, upon request, to render binding advisory opinions regarding the applicability of such prohibition with respect to specific research projects or practices.Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should cooperate with foreign countries to enforce mutually supported restrictions on such prohibited activities.Amends the Public Health Service Act to require research involving nuclear transplantation to be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal standards for the protection of human subjects."
