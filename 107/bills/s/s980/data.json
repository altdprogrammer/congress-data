Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees if installation of a lap and shoulder belt assembly is not practicable for a particular designated seating position in a particular type of motor vehicle.(Sec. 5) Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to extend the child passenger protection education grants program for a two-year period.(Sec. 6) Amends Federal highway law to direct the Secretary to: (1) establish appropriate criteria applicable to child restraint laws for purposes of eligibility for grants on improving child passenger safety programs for children under the age of 16 years; and (2) make such grants to each State and Indian tribe that has a child restraint law in effect as of September 30, 2004.
