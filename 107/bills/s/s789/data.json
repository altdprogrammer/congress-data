Makes such bond amounts: (1) $5,000, for members who enter into the agreement before completing three years of active duty; (2) the excess of $15,000 over the face amount of any bonds previously purchased for such members who have completed at least three years of active service but less than nine years; and (3) the excess of $30,000 over such face amount for members who have completed nine years of active service. Requires the pro rata repayment of such bond amounts for the non-completion of the required additional service, with a waiver when repayment is considered to be against equity and good conscience or contrary to the best interests of the United States."
