    "text": "Aviation Security Enhancement Act of 2002 - Amends Federal aviation law to direct the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security of the Transportation Security Administration to notify the owner or operator of each U.S. airport of the number and type of explosive detection systems that will be required to be deployed at the airport in order to screen all checked baggage without imposing unreasonable delays on the passengers. Requires each owner or operator to: (1) notify the Under Secretary by a specified date if they are not able to make modifications to the airport's terminal buildings that are necessary to accommodate the explosive detection systems; and (2) develop a plan, if notice is given, by a specified date for making necessary modifications to the terminal buildings so as to deploy and fully utilize explosive detection systems to screen all checked baggage. Requires the Under Secretary to carry out demonstration projects for the installation and testing of alternative explosive detection systems at not less than five U.S. airports. Sets forth certain plan and demonstration requirements."
