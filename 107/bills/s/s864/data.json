Eliminates the bar to the admission of such person's spouse or children.(Sec. 4) Prohibits an alien who has engaged in Nazi persecution, genocide, acts of torture, extrajudicial killings, or severe violations of religious freedom from establishing good moral character under such Act.(Sec. 5) Directs the Attorney General to establish within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (Department) an Office of Special Investigations to investigate and denaturalize an alien who has participated in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killing abroad.Authorizes the Attorney General to delegate to any office or component of the Department the responsibility for determining inadmissibility, deportation, removal, prosecution, or extradition of any alien who has participated in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killing abroad.States that in determining the proper legal action against such an alien, consideration shall be given to the availability of U.S. prosecution or removal to a foreign jurisdiction for prosecution.Authorizes appropriations for the Department to ensure that the Office of Special Investigations fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war criminals.(Sec. 6) Directs the Attorney General to report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding implementation of this Act."
