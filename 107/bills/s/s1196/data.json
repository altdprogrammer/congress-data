Revises removal requirements, including provisions concerning hearings, issuance of an order of removal, the authority to suspend or prohibit the business participation of a management official, judicial review of suspensions, and the authority to suspend a management official due to the commission of or participation in a felony involving dishonesty or a breach of trust.(Sec. 6) Reduces, for a two-year period beginning on October 1, 2002: (1) the guarantee fee for SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses; (2) the annual fee charged for such loans; and (3) the fee charged for the SBA guaranty of the payment of principal and interest on debentures issued by a qualified State or local development company. Prohibits the SBA, with respect to the latter fee, from charging any up-front fee with respect to such loans during such two-year period. Provides for the budgetary treatment of loans and financings made to small businesses during such period. Makes this section effective only upon the availability of appropriated funds to offset the cost of such amendments."
