    "text": "Air Travelers Fair Treatment Act of 2001 - Amends Federal transportation law to make it an unfair or deceptive practice for an air carrier or foreign air carrier to fail to provide a passenger with an accurate explanation of the reasons for a flight delay, cancellation, or diversion from a ticketed itinerary.Makes it an unfair or deceptive practice for an air carrier or foreign air carrier, in the case of a termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in the competitive circumstances of the appointment of a ticket agent by an air carrier or foreign air carrier, to fail: (1) to provide the ticket agent with written notice, and a full statement of reasons for the action, on or before the 90th day preceding the action; and (2) to provide the ticket agent with at least 60 days to correct any deficiency claimed. Exempts from this rule cases of insolvency, an assignment for the benefit of creditors, bankruptcy, or nonpayment of sums due under the appointment.Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations to establish minimum standards for resuscitation, emergency medical, and first-aid equipment and supplies to be carried on board an aircraft capable of carrying at least 30 passengers.Prohibits air carriers or foreign air carriers from preventing, hindering, or failing to assist any passenger from exiting an aircraft (under the same circumstances as any flight crew member may exit) if: (1) the aircraft is parked over an hour past its scheduled departure time at an airport terminal gate with access to ramp or other boarding and deplaning facilities; and (2) the aircraft captain has not been informed by air traffic control authorities that the aircraft can be cleared for departure within 15 minutes.Directs the Secretary to require by regulations each air carrier or foreign air carrier to provide, upon request, to their passengers any information concerning the safety of the aircraft and the competency of the aircraft crew.Directs the National Transportation Safety Board to establish and administer a program for victims and survivors of aircraft accidents in which they receive immediate and unrestricted access to information with regard to such accidents. Establishes a toll-free telephone line for the public to provide specified information concerning an aircraft accident.Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act."
