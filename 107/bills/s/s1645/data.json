    "text": "Belarus Democracy Act of 2001 - Authorizes the President to support primarily indigenous Belarusian political parties and nongovernmental organizations in various activities that may include: (1) promotion of democracy as well as of Belarus' independence and sovereignty; (2) development of independent media supported by nonstate-controlled printing facilities; (3) support of human rights; and (4) establishment of international exchanges and advanced professional training programs for leaders and members of democratic forces that foster the growth of civil society.Places economic sanctions on Belarus and bars senior Belarusian leaders and their immediate relations from entering the United States. Allows sanctions to be lifted only if the Belarusian Government meets specific democratic conditions. Affirms solidarity with the democratic forces in Belarus and calls upon the Government of Belarus to permit basic freedoms and allow free, fair and transparent elections. Calls upon the Russian Government to end assistance to the regime of Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenka."
