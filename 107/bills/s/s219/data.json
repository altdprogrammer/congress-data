    "text": "Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to modify, for a three year period, certain procedures for the provision of development assistance to major drug-transit and major illicit drug producing countries.Requires the President, for each fiscal year during such period, to identify to the appropriate congressional committees each major drug-transit country or major illicit drug producing country, and designate any identified country that has failed during the previous 12 months to make substantial efforts to: (1) adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements, including the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and any bilateral or multilateral narcotics agreement between the United States and other countries; and (2) take certain counternarcotics measures.Authorizes development assistance to such country in a fiscal year only if the President determines and reports to the appropriate congressional committees that: (1) provision of such assistance to the country is vital to the national interests of the United States; or (2) such country has made substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements, and to take certain counternarcotics measures.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) an enhanced multilateral strategy should be developed among drug producing, transit, and consuming nations designed to improve cooperation with respect to the investigation and prosecution of drug related crimes, and to make available information on effective drug education and drug treatment; (2) the United States should convene in 2001 a conference of representatives of major illicit drug producing, drug transit, and money laundering countries to review drug reduction and prevention strategies and agree to a program for implementing them; and (3) the President should send Congress legislation necessary to implement a proposed multilateral strategy.Requires the President's annual international narcotics control strategy report to identify major foreign drug trafficking organizations.Amends the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act to repeal the denial of ( and thus permit) judicial review of certain determinations, identifications, findings, and designations made with respect to foreign narcotics traffickers."
