    "text": "Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal judicial code to grant Federal district courts original jurisdiction over any civil action involving minimal diversity of citizenship between adverse parties that arises from a single accident, where at least 75 natural persons have died in the accident at a discrete location, if: (1) a defendant resides in a State and a substantial part of the accident took place in another State or other location; (2) any two defendants reside in different States; or (3) substantial parts of the accident took place in different States. Directs the district court to abstain from hearing any such action in which: (1) the substantial majority of all plaintiffs are citizens of a single State of which the primary defendants are also citizens; and (2) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the laws of that State.Authorizes venue for such action in any district in which a defendant resides or in which a substantial part of the accident occurred. Permits a district court to retain such actions for the determination of liability and damages.Permits removal of actions which could have been brought in district court under the above provisions from State to U.S. district courts. Establishes a presumption in favor of discretionary remand to State courts for damages determinations after rulings on liability.Authorizes nationwide service of process and, upon a showing of good cause, nationwide service of subpoenas with regard to actions under this Act."
