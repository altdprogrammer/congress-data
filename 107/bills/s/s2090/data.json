    "text": "Sexual Assault Prosecution Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal criminal code to remove any statute of limitations on indictments for sexual offenses.Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to develop a plan to grant voluntary awards to States to facilitate deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of all casework evidence of unsolved crimes, with the objective of effectively expediting the analysis of all such evidence in an efficient and effective manner and to provide for the entry of DNA profiles into the Combined DNA Indexing System. Directs the FBI to develop grant criteria, including: (1) the number of unsolved crimes awaiting DNA analysis; and (2) the development of a comprehensive plan to collect and analyze DNA evidence. Sets forth award conditions regarding quality assurance standards, DNA sample and analysis availability, and a 15 percent matching requirement."
