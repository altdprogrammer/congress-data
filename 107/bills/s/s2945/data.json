    "text": "21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act - (Sec. 4) Directs the President to establish a National Nanotechnology Research Program. Requires such Program, through appropriate Federal agencies, councils, and the National Coordination Office, to: (1) establish goals, priorities, grand challenges (fundamental problems in science and engineering that will require the application of nanotechnology), and metrics for evaluating Federal nanotechnology research, development, and other activities; (2) invest in Federal research and development (R&D) programs in nanotechnology and related sciences to achieve those goals; and (3) provide for coordination of Federal nanotechnology activities.Requires the Program, through its participating agencies, to develop, fund, and manage Federal programs concerning: (1) long-term basic nanoscience and engineering research; (2) essential grand challenges and interdisciplinary research and education teams; (3) interdisciplinary nanotechnology research centers (provides for funding ten new centers); (4) research infrastructure and equipment (including the employment of underutilized manufacturing facilities in areas of high unemployment as production engineering and research test-beds for micron-scale technologies); (5) the Center for Ethical, Societal, Educational, Legal, and Workforce Issues Related to Nanotechnology (to be established by the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF)); and (6) technology transition.(Sec. 5) Directs the National Science and Technology Council to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program, including establishment of an Information Services and Applications Council to promote access to and early application of the technologies, innovations, and expertise derived from nanotechnology R&D program activities to Federal agency missions and systems and to U.S. industry.Directs the President to establish a National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel (composed of up to 20 individuals who are not Federal employees) and a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office.Provides for the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a triennial evaluation of the Program and a biennial study of the relative position of the United Sates compared to other nations with respect to nanotechnology R&D.(Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations to carry out responsibilities under this Act to: (1) NSF; (2) the Department of Energy; (3) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; (4) the National Institutes of Health; (5) the National Institute of Standards and Technology; (6) the Environmental Protection Agency; and (7) the Department of Justice.(Sec. 7) Provides for the Program to monitor U.S. standing in key research fields that support technological innovation.Requires the NSF Director to: (1) collect and disseminate studies on the societal, ethical, educational, and workforce implications of nanotechnology; and (2) collect data on the size of the anticipated nanotechnology workforce needed and assess the adequacy of the trained talent pool to fill such needs."
