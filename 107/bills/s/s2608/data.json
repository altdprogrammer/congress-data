Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make program grants to coastal States for the purpose of acquiring property interests. Prohibits any more than 75 percent of the grant funding from being derived from Federal sources. Provides for waivers of such requirement, including for underserved communities.Authorizes the Secretary to provide $5 million for a regional watershed protection demonstration project that: (1) leverages land acquisition funding from other Federal conservation or acquisition programs; (2) involves partnerships with Federal, State, and non-governmental entities; (3) creates conservation corridors; (4) protects habitats under imminent threat of development or conversion; (5) provides water quality protection for areas under the National Estuarine Research Reserve program; and (6) provides a model for future regional watershed protection projects.Reserves no less than 15 percent of program funds for acquisitions benefitting the National Estuarine Research Reserve.Specifies that when property is acquired under this program: (1) title will be held by the grant recipient; (2) property will be managed consistent with the purpose of the program; and (3) funds will be returned to the Secretary if the property is sold, exchanged, or divested.Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 4) Permits the Secretary to enter into contracts or other arrangements with other Federal agencies in conducting the program of technical assistance and management-oriented research necessary to support the development and implementation of State coastal management program amendments furthering cooperative international coastal zone management."
