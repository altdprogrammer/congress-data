Declares it to be U.S. policy to: (1) reduce the number of nuclear warheads and delivery systems of the United States and Russia, through bilateral agreements, to the lowest possible number consistent with national security, requiring any warhead removed to be kept safe and secure, accounted for, and eventually destroyed or eliminated in a verifiable manner; (2) pursue with Russia formal arrangements to remove as many nuclear weapons of the two nations as possible from immediate, launch-ready status, beginning with those weapons earmarked for downloading, dismantlement, or elimination under the START II Treaty; and (3) work cooperatively with Russia to prevent the diversion from Russia of nuclear weapons, materials, and expertise.Requires the President to submit to Congress a plan for nonproliferation programs with Russia, as well as a related study."
