    "text": "Tribal Recognition and Indian Bureau Enhancement Act of 2001 - Permits any Indian group in the continental United States that desires to be acknowledged as an Indian tribe and that can satisfy the mandatory criteria for Federal acknowledgment to submit to the Secretary of the Interior a letter of intent in advance of or with its documented petition (arguments to substantiate claims to continuous existence as an Indian tribe).Requires the: (1) Department of the Interior to publish every three years a list of all Indian tribes entitled to receive services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs; (2) Secretary to make available guidelines for, and the Department to provide advice on, the preparation of documented petitions; and (3) Secretary to consider the criteria for acknowledgment to be met upon finding that it is more likely than not that the evidence presented demonstrates establishment of each criterion.Sets forth the mandatory criteria for Federal acknowledgment, including: (1) the group has been identified as an American Indian entity since 1900; (2) a predominant portion of the group has comprised a distinct community from historical times; (3) the petitioner has maintained political authority over its members as an autonomous entity; and (4) the group is composed principally of individuals who are not members of any acknowledged tribe.Prescribes notification and processing requirements concerning letters of intent and documented petitions. Requires the Secretary to publish a complete explanation of final decisions regarding documented petitions."
