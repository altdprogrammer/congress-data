Requires the President, for each fiscal year during such period, to identify to the appropriate congressional committees any country the President proposes to subject (with enactment of a joint resolution by Congress) to the withholding of half of any allocated bilateral assistance, and to opposition to any multilateral assistance to such country, because it is not: (1) cooperating with the United States in achieving full compliance with the goals and objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; (2) taking adequate steps on its own to achieve full compliance with the Convention; or (3) taking adequate steps to achieve full compliance with a bilateral agreement with the United States on illicit drug control.Requires the inclusion of the identity of major drug trafficking organizations in the President's annual international narcotics control strategy report."
