Provides for a strategic plan for National Indian Gaming Commission activities, including a performance plan.Directs the Commission to establish a schedule of fees to be paid annually by each gaming operation that conducts a class II or III Indian gaming activity.Requires all fees and civil forfeitures collected by the Commission pursuant to such Act to be maintained in separate accounts and expended only for the purposes set forth in the Act.Places class I gaming on Indian lands within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indian tribes. Requires an Indian tribe to retain the primary jurisdiction to regulate class II gaming activities that, at a minimum, shall be conducted in conformity with Federal standards and regulations promulgated by the Commission relating to the: (1) monitoring and regulation of tribal gaming; (2) establishment and regulation of internal control systems; and (3) conduct of background investigation. Requires an Indian tribe to retain primary jurisdiction to regulate class III gaming activities and requires that any such gaming be conducted in conformity with Federal standards and such regulations.Provides that existing regulations that established minimum internal control standards shall have no force or effect one year after the enactment of this Act.Authorizes the Commission, using funds collected from civil fines, to provide grants and technical assistance to Indian tribes for training and assistance related to Indian gaming."
