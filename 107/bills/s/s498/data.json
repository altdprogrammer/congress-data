Permits designation of any such trail on Federal lands and, with the owner's consent, on any non-Federal lands.Prohibits a trail from being considered feasible and desirable for designation as a national discovery trail unless it: (1) links one or more areas within the boundaries of a metropolitan area (and should join with other trails, connecting the National Trails System to significant recreation and resources areas); (2) is supported by a competent trailwide volunteer- based organization and has extensive local and trailwide support by the public, user groups, and affected State and local governments; and (3) extends and passes through more than one State and, at a minimum, is a continuous, walkable route.Designates as a national discovery trail the 6,000-mile American Discovery Trail which shall extend from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware to Point Reyes National Seashore in California, traveling northern and southern routes from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Denver, Colorado.Directs the appropriate Secretary to submit within three fiscal years to specified congressional committees a comprehensive plan for the protection, management, development, and use of the national discovery trail."
