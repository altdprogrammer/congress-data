    "text": "Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 - Title I: Public Company Accounting Oversight Board - Establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to: (1) oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws; (2) establish audit report standards and rules; and (2) investigate, inspect, and enforce compliance relating to registered public accounting firms, associated persons, and the obligations and liabilities of accountants.(Sec. 101) Prohibits Board membership from including more than two certified public accountants.(Sec. 102) Mandates registration with the Board by any public accounting firm that performs or participates in any audit report with respect to any issuer.(Sec. 105) Empowers the Board to impose disciplinary or remedial sanctions upon registered public accounting firms and their associated persons who are in violation of this Act, including the securities laws relating to the preparation and issuance of audit reports and the obligations and liabilities of accountants with respect to them.Restricts liability to intentional conduct, or repeated instances of negligent conduct.Authorizes Board sanctions upon a registered accounting firm or its supervisory personnel for failure to supervise.(Sec. 106) Places within the purview of this Act: (1) foreign public accounting firms that prepare or furnish an audit report with respect to any issuer; and (2) audit workpapers.(Sec. 107) Grants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) general oversight of the Board and the power to review Board actions, including general modification and rescission of Board authority.(Sec. 108) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to: (1) authorize the SEC to recognize, as \"generally accepted\" for purposes of the securities laws, any accounting principles established by a standard setting body; and (2) direct the SEC to study and report to Congress on the adoption by the U.S. financial reporting system of a principles-based accounting system.Title II: Auditor Independence - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit a registered public accounting firm from performing specified non-audit services contemporaneously with a mandatory audit. Requires preapproval for non-audit services not expressly forbidden by statute.(Sec. 203) Mandates: (1) audit partner rotation on a five-year basis; and (2) auditor reports to audit committees of the issuer.(Sec. 206) Prohibits a registered public accounting firm from performing statutorily mandated audit services for an issuer if the issuer's senior management officials had been employed by such firm and participated in the audit of that issuer during the one-year period preceding the audit initiation date.(Sec. 209) States that it is the intention of this Act that, in supervising nonregistered public accounting firms and their associated persons, appropriate State regulatory authorities should make an independent determination of the proper standards applicable, particularly taking into consideration the size and nature of the business of the accounting firms they supervise.Title III: Corporate Responsibility - Vests the audit committee of an issuer with responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of any registered public accounting firm employed to perform audit services. Requires committee members to be a member of the board of directors of the issuer, and to be otherwise be independent.(Sec. 302) Requires the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of an issuer to: (1) certify that periodic financial statements filed with the SEC fairly present, in all material respects, the operations and financial condition of the issuer; and (2) forfeit certain bonuses and compensation received following an issuer's accounting restatement owing to noncompliance with securities laws.(Sec. 305) Authorizes a court to prohibit a violator of certain SEC rules from serving as an officer or director of an issuer if the person's conduct demonstrates unfitness to serve (the current standard is \"substantial unfitness\").(Sec. 306) Prohibits insider trades during pension fund blackout periods. States that profits realized from such trades shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer irrespective of the intent of the parties to the transaction.Title IV: Enhanced Financial Disclosures - Instructs the SEC to require by rule: (1) disclosure of all material off-balance sheet transactions and relationships that may have a material effect upon the financial status of an issuer; and (2) the presentation of pro forma financial information in a manner that is not misleading, and which is reconcilable with the financial condition of the issuer under generally accepted accounting principles.(Sec. 401) Directs the SEC to study and report to Congress on: (1) the extent of off-balance sheet transactions and the use of special purpose entities; and (2) whether generally accepted accounting rules result in financial statements that reflect the economics of such off-balance sheet transactions in a transparent fashion to investors; and (3) the extent to which special purpose entities are used to facilitate off-balance sheet transactions.(Sec. 402) Prohibits a corporation from making personal loans to its corporate executives. Cites exceptions for home improvement and manufactured home loans made in the ordinary course of the consumer credit business of such issuer and made on terms that are no more favorable than those offered to the general public.(Sec. 403) Reduces the mandatory period for principal stockholders or senior executives to disclose changes in ownership of securities or security-based swap agreements to two business days after changes were executed (presently ten days after the close of a calendar month).
