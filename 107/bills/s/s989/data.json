Authorizes the United States, or an individual injured by racial profiling, to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce this prohibition.Specifies that proof that the routine investigatory activities of law enforcement agents in a jurisdiction have had a disparate impact on racial or ethnic minorities shall constitute prima facie evidence of a violation. Authorizes the court to allow a prevailing plaintiff, other than the United States, reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs, including expert fees.Requires Federal law enforcement agencies to: (1) maintain adequate policies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling; and (2) cease existing practices that encourage racial profiling.Directs that any application by a State or governmental unit for funding under a covered program include a certification that such unit and any agency to which it is redistributing program funds: (1) maintains adequate policies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling; and (2) has ceased existing practices that encourage racial profiling.Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States, law enforcement agencies and other governmental units, Indian tribal governments, or other public and private entities to develop and implement best practice devices and systems to ensure the racially neutral administration of justice.Directs the Attorney General to submit to Congress a report on racial profiling by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies."
