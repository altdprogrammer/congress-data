    "text": "Children's Environmental Protection Act - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that each environmental pollutant standard protects children and other vulnerable subpopulations with an adequate margin of safety, evaluate child susceptibility data concerning any pollutant for which a standard is established, and adopt an additional margin of safety in the absence of reliable data.Requires the Administrator to annually repromulgate at least three of the standards identified by the Children's Environmental Health Protection Advisory Committee (established by this Act) as posing a special risk to children or publish a finding explaining the decision not to do so.Requires each federally funded school and day care center to reduce child pesticide exposure and provide parents with advance notification of any pesticide application.Directs the Administrator to distribute certain EPA guidance for a least toxic pest control strategy and an annual list of pesticides that contain an identified carcinogen, developmental or reproductive toxin, category I or II acute nerve toxin, or endocrine disrupter. Bars federally funded facilities from applying any such pesticide.Requires parental notice and the posting of warning signs before pesticide applications.Directs the Administrator to identify pollutants commonly used or found in areas accessible to children and publish lists of safer substances, exposure reduction guidelines, and right-to-know information.Amends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 to require the Administrator to identify, and establish thresholds for, toxic chemicals that may present a significant risk to children's health or the environment. Requires reporting by other substantially contributing facilities.Amends TSCA to direct the Administrator and the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to coordinate and support research to examine the health effects and toxicity of environmental pollutants on children and vulnerable subpopulations."
