Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the progress made in achieving such national policy.Authorizes the Secretary to contract with Papa Ola Lokahi (an organization of public agencies and private organizations focused on improving the health status of Native Hawaiians) to support community-based initiatives that are reflective of holistic approaches to health. Authorizes Papa Ola Lokahi and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (Office) to enter into a memorandum of understanding to accomplish such objectives. Requires a report from Papa Ola Lokahi to Congress on the impact of current Federal and State health care financing mechanisms and policies on the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians. Authorizes appropriations.Requires Papa Ola Lokahi to serve as a clearinghouse for the collection and maintenance of data associated with the health status of Native Hawaiians. Requires the Secretary to provide Papa Ola Lokahi and the Office, at least annually, an accounting of funds and services provided to States and other organizations from the Department of Health and Human Services for purposes set forth in this Act. Directs Papa Ola Lokahi to make annual recommendations to the Secretary with respect to the allocation of all amounts appropriated under the Act. Requires Federal agencies providing health care financing and carrying out health care programs to consult with Native Hawaiians and organizations providing health care services to Native Hawaiians prior to the adoption of any policy or regulation impacting the provision of services or health insurance coverage. Requires the State of Hawaii to consult with Native Hawaiians and such organizations prior to making or initiating new programs. Authorizes the Office to develop arrangements with any Federal agency or other agencies providing full or partial health insurance to Native Hawaiians for appropriate reimbursement for services provided. Authorizes the use of traditional healers as part of such services.Limits to eight the number of Native Hawaiian health care systems that the Secretary may award a grant to or contract with to provide comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services for Native Hawaiians. Authorizes the Secretary, in addition to such grants and contracts, to make a grant to or contract with Papa Ola Lokahi for planning with Native Hawaiian health care systems or a Native Hawaiian Center to serve the health needs of Native Hawaiian communities on each of the islands of Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Hawaii, Lanai, Kauai, and Niihau. Adds to the services authorized under all such grants and contracts the support of culturally appropriate activities enhancing health and wellness, including land-, water-, ocean-, and spiritually-based projects and programs. Extends through FY 2012 the authorization of appropriations for such grants.Extends through FY 2012 the authorization of appropriations for administrative grants for Papa Ola Lokahi.Changes reporting requirements of grant entities from a quarterly to an annual basis.Allows the Secretary to provide funds to an appropriate Native Hawaiian organization or health care organization (currently, only to Kamehameha Schools) to provide scholarship assistance to Native Hawaiian students enrolled in health professions courses or programs. Adds the provision of fellowships to authorized fund uses. Authorizes a priority for such assistance for employees of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems and the Native Hawaiian Health Centers. Extends through FY 2012 the authorization of appropriations for such scholarships and fellowships.Directs the Secretary to permit organizations receiving contracts or grants under this Act to use government facilities and equipment in carrying out authorized purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to donate excess property, or to acquire excess or surplus property, for such purposes.Authorizes the Secretary to provide funds to carry out Native Hawaiian demonstration projects of national significance. Prohibits such funding from reducing other funding provided under this Act.Establishes a National Bipartisan Native Hawaiian Health Care Entitlement Commission: (1) to establish a study committee to collect and compile data concerning Native Hawaiian needs with regard to the provision of health services; and (2) after reviewing the study committee's report, to make recommendations to Congress for the provision of such services as an entitlement. Authorizes appropriations."
