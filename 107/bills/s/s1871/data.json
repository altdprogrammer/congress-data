    "text": "Safe Rails Act of 2002 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to: (1) conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and security needs analysis of hazardous materials transportation in the railroad freight transportation industry; (2) assess the security risks associated with such transportation; and (3) develop prioritized recommendations for improving the security of rail tunnels, rail bridges, rail switching areas, and other areas posing significant rail-related risks to human health and public safety and the movement of interstate commerce, and for dealing with the immediate and long-term economic impact of measures that may be required to address those risks. Requires a report to specified congressional committees within 180 days after enactment of this Act.Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a Rail Security Fund account in the Treasury from which the Secretary of Transportation may make grants of up to $100 million annually to freight railroads, hazardous materials shippers, or owners of tank cars used in the transportation of hazardous materials, for full or partial reimbursement of costs incurred on or after September 11, 2001, in the conduct of specified activities to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism, sabotage, or other security threats. Permits grants to railroads of more than $100 million annually if as a result of the security risk assessment the Secretary determines that critical rail transportation security needs require reimbursement to any eligible entity in such amounts. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 and 2004."
