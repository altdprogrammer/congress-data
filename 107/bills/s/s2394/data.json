States that drugs or products with delayed assessments will be deemed misbranded and subject to seizure and injunctive proceedings, though not penalties.Permits full waiver of such assessments if: (1) studies are highly impracticable or impossible and the evidence suggests that the drug or product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups; or (2) there is no meaningful therapeutic advantage or benefit in the pediatric population and little risk if used as labeled.Permits partial waivers at the request of an applicant for a specific pediatric subpopulation if any of the full waiver grounds apply to that subpopulation or reasonable attempts for a pediatric formulation for that subpopulation have failed. Requires labels of these drugs or products to reflect such waivers."
