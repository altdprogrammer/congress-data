    "text": "Alaska Wetlands Conservation Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide that specified guidelines for disposal sites for the discharge of dredged and fill material into navigable waters for States with substantial conserved wetlands areas: (1) shall not require mitigation to compensate for wetlands loss and adverse impacts; (2) may include requirements for minimization of such impacts; and (3) may include requirements for avoidance of impacts but may not require the permit applicant to establish that alternative sites do not exist.Directs the Secretary of the Army, at the request of such a State, to issue a general permit for such State which applies to the discharge of dredged or fill material into disposal sites of at least ten acres, and may not contain guidelines for disposal sites that are more stringent than the guidelines described above. Describes nonprohibited discharges of such material in such States.Requires the Secretary to issue a permit to a holder of economic base lands (specified lands conveyed to or owned by Alaska Native entities or the State of Alaska) for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at a disposal site if such discharge complies with reasonable guideline established by the Secretary.Directs the Secretary to issue general permits for categories of activities on economic base lands relating to the development of rural Alaska community infrastructure without determining whether such activities will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects."
