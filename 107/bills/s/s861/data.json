    "text": "Governmentwide Mentor-Protege Program Act of 2001 - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to establish the Governmentwide Mentor-Protege Program under which major Federal contractors (mentor firms) assist eligible small businesses (protege firms) to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under Federal contracts. Requires a mentor-protege agreement regarding the assistance to be provided.Provides incentives for mentor firms to enter into such agreements, including reimbursement for progress or advance payments made to protege firms in connection with a Federal contract, as well as reimbursement for mentoring assistance (with a total reimbursement limit of $1 million per protege firm). Prohibits a mentor firm from requiring an eligible small business to enter into an agreement as a condition for the award of a contract or subcontract.Makes eligible for such Program: (1) any qualified HUBZone small business; and (2) any small business owned and controlled by women, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, or service-disabled veterans."
