Declares that during such period: (1) the State of Maine shall not lose its apportionment of Federal-aid highway funds by reason of noncompliance with Federal vehicle weight limitations applicable to the use of certain combination vehicles weighing over 80,000 pounds on any covered highway (that portion of the highway on the Interstate System within the State of Maine that was not exempt from Federal vehicle weight limitations as of the day before enactment of this Act); and (2) combination vehicles consisting of a three-axle tractor unit hauling a single trailer or semitrailer that exceed 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight and that were permitted to use non-Interstate System highways in Maine under State vehicle weight laws as of the date of the establishment of the pilot program shall be permitted to use such highway. Provides such waiver of limitations shall become permanent unless the Secretary determines it has resulted in an adverse impact on highway safety."
