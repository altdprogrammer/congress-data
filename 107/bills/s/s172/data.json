Permits recovery of implementation and enforcement costs incurred by the ERO and each Affiliated Regional Reliability Entity, respectively.Instructs FERC to establish a regional advisory body upon the petition of certain State Governors.Limits ERO authority exclusively to bulk-power system reliability standards.Denies the ERO and FERC any authority to set and enforce compliance with adequacy or safety standards governing either electric facilities or services.Declares that nothing in this Act preempts State action that is not inconsistent with ERO standards."
