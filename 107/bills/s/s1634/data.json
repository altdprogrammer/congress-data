    "text": "Imported Perishable Product Safety Improvement Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a system to deny the importation of any perishable product if the Secretary determines it has a history of adulteration or association with serious health issues, including a single outbreak of serious disease. Sets forth requirements for processing such products, including examination, holding, destruction, and subsequent labeling as refused entry.Prohibits: (1) port shopping when a product has been refused admission; and (2) imports of perishable products by debarred persons.Provides for the promulgation and enforcement of regulations governing, and the imposition of penalties against, the importing of contaminated perishable products. Authorizes the debarment of repeat offenders.Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary to (1) make grants or agreements with, and provide technical assistance to, eligible agencies to enhance their capacity to carry out activities relating to surveillance and prevention of pathogen-related disease borne in a perishable product; and (2) conduct related training, education, and public awareness activities. Requires the Secretary to award grants to universities, nonprofits, and industrial partners to develop improved methods of pathogen detection and food safety monitoring sensors."
