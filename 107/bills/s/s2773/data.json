    "text": "High Plains Aquifer Hydrogeologic Characterization, Mapping, Modeling and Monitoring Act - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of the Interior, working through the United States Geological Survey and in cooperation with participating State geological surveys and water management agencies of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming (the High Plains Aquifer States), to establish and carry out the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Characterization, Mapping, Modeling and Monitoring Program.Requires the Program to: (1) undertake mapping of the hydrogeological configuration of the Aquifer; (2) perform analyses of the current and past rates at which groundwater is being withdrawn and recharged, the net rate of decrease or increase in Aquifer storage, the factors controlling the rate of horizontal and vertical migration of water, and the current and past rate of change of saturated thickness within the Aquifer; and (3) develop regional databases and groundwater flow models.Provides for Federal and State components to the Program. Requires the Secretary to make available 50 percent of the funds available pursuant to this Act for carrying out the State component.Includes as Federal component priorities: (1) coordinating Federal, State, and local data, maps, and models into an integrated physical characterization of the Aquifer; (2) supporting State and local activities with scientific and technical specialists; and (3) undertaking activities and providing technical capabilities not available at the State and local levels. Requires that such component include interdisciplinary studies that add value to hydrogeologic characterization, mapping, modeling, and monitoring for the Aquifer.Allows a High Plains Aquifer State to elect to participate in the State component. Includes as State component priorities hydrogeologic characterization, mapping, modeling, and monitoring activities in areas of the Aquifer that will assist in addressing issues relating to groundwater depletion and resource assessment of the Aquifer. Directs the Governor of a participating State to appoint a State panel (representing a broad range of users of and persons knowledgeable regarding hydrogeologic data and information) to recommend State component priorities.Requires: (1) 20 percent of the funds available under the State component be equally divided among the State geological surveys of the High Plains Aquifer States to carry out the purposes of the Program; and (2) the remaining funds under such component to be competitively awarded to State or local agencies or entities in participating High Plains Aquifer States, including State geological surveys, State water management agencies, institutions of higher education, or consortia of such agencies or entities. Permits a State to submit a proposal for the U.S. Geological Survey to undertake activities and provide technical capabilities not available at State and local levels. Provides that such funds shall be awarded by the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey only for proposals that have been recommended by the State panels, subjected to peer review, and given final prioritization and recommendation by the Federal Review Panel. States that proposals for multi-state activities must be recommended by the State panel of at least one of the affected States.Provides for the establishment of a Federal Review Panel to: (1) evaluate the proposals submitted for funding under the State component; and (2) review and coordinate the Federal component priorities, the Federal interdisciplinary studies, and the State component priorities.Prohibits: (1) the U.S. Geological survey from using any of the funds to be made available under the State component to pay indirect, servicing, or Program management charges; and (2) recipients of awards granted under this Act from using more than 18 percent of the award amount for any fiscal year for such charges. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of the total cost of a funded activity.(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director, to prepare a plan for the Program to addressing overall priorities a management structure, and Program operations.(Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to submit reports to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Governors of the High Plains Aquifer States on the status of: (1) implementation of the Program; and (2) the High Plains Aquifer, including aquifer recharge rates, extraction rates, saturated thickness, and water table levels.(Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations."
