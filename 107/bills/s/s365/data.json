Restricts the use to levels of no less than the average wintertime use and activity over the last three winters.Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior: (1) under certain conditions, to address or avert significant environmental impacts in a particular unit or portion thereof, to restrict such use down to a level that is no less than 50 percent below the three year average; and (2) to prohibit such use within all NPS units not listed in this Act.Requires: (1) the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate final national standards governing emissions by snowmobiles; (2) the National Park Service, in conjunction with the Society of Automotive Engineers, to set noise standards for snowmobile use in the NPS; and (3) the Service to propose revised regulations and management plans to govern such use, based on results of new comprehensive studies."
