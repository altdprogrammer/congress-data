Provides that in the case of an electing Settlement Trust with a net capital gain for the taxable year, a tax is imposed on such gain at the rate of tax which would apply to such gain if the taxpayer were subject to a tax on its other taxable income at only the lowest rate. Provides for the tax treatment of distributions to beneficiaries. Sets forth information reporting requirements."
