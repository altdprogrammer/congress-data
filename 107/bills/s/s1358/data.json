Instructs the Architect of the Capitol to develop and implement energy and water savings measures in congressional buildings. Declares that the aggregate annual payments by a Federal agency under an energy savings performance contract may take into account savings resulting from certain reduced costs of operation and maintenance.Establishes the Federal Energy Bank to make loans to Federal agencies to implement energy savings performance projects.Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe: (1) minimum average fuel economy guidelines for the Federal vehicle fleet; and (2) operating parameters for the use of alternative fuels."
