Deems such a facility to be an Indian Health Service (IHS) facility with the Federal medical assistance percentage set at 100 percent if it meets all applicable conditions and requirements and has a plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that indicates that the facility is licensed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization."
