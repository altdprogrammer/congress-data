    "text": "Home Health Nurse and Patient Act of 2001 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) Task Force to study and report to the Secretary and Congress on the comprehensive assessment of patients to determine whether: (1) the number of assessments required during an episode of care or the number of questions asked during each assessment should be decreased to eliminate redundant and uninformative clinical information; (2) a uniform data collection standard is needed to ensure that patients who are not Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act (SSA)) or Medicaid (SSA title XIX) beneficiaries receive the same quality of care as Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries; and (3) OASIS data should be collected from Medicaid beneficiaries who are not Medicare beneficiaries.Directs the Secretary to promulgate a regulation revising the data collection requirements under the OASIS standard used as part of the comprehensive assessment of patients to: (1) make use of such requirements optional for patients of home health agencies who are not Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries; and (2) eliminate such requirements for any home health agency patient to whom only personal care services are furnished.Requires the Secretary to review each regulation relating to the demand billing process for individuals who are both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to determine whether it may be conducted in a manner that is efficient, allows for determination of Medicare coverage of home health services and expedient claims submission, and does not adversely affect Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries or home health agencies in determination of whether Medicare payment may be made for an item or service.Directs the Secretary to establish the Claims Review and Audit Task Force to study and report to the Secretary and Congress on the processes and policies used to review medical claims submitted by home health agencies and on other specified matters.Provides for the implementation of Task Force recommendations."
