    "text": "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act - Prohibits funds appropriated by the Congress from being used to take the life of an unborn child, except for those medical procedures required to prevent the death of either the pregnant woman or her unborn child so long as every reasonable effort is made to preserve the life of each.Prohibits the use of such funds to promote, encourage, counsel for, refer for, pay for (including travel expenses), or do research on, abortions.Prohibits the Federal Government from entering into any contract for insurance which provides for payment or reimbursement for abortion services.States that no institution receiving Federal financial assistance shall: (1) discriminate against any employee, applicant, or student on the basis of that person's opposition to abortion; or (2) require any employee or student to participate in abortion procedures.States that attorney's fees shall not be allowed in any civil action involving a law prohibiting or restricting abortions.Provides for Supreme Court review of lower court decisions which declare State and local anti-abortion statutes unconstitutional."
