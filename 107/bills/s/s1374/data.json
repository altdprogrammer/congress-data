    "text": "Hydraulic Fracturing Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) study the effects on underground drinking water sources of hydraulic fracturing to determine whether regulation of such practice is necessary to protect such sources; and (2) promulgate such regulations as are determined to be necessary. Provides that a determination that regulation is unnecessary will relieve States from any further obligation to regulate hydraulic fracturing as an underground injection. Defines \"hydraulic fracturing\" as the process of creating a fracture in a reservoir rock, and injecting fluids and propping agents, for the purposes of reservoir stimulation related to oil and gas production activities."
