    "text": "Provides a presumption of eligibility for trade adjustment assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 for a worker (including a worker in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) in an industry where the International Trade Commission (ITC) notifies the Secretary of Labor that it has made an affirmative determination that an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury (or threat thereof) to that industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article.Requires the Secretary, where a worker is presumed eligible for assistance, to: (1) initiate outreach to the industry to gather information on the number and geographic location of workers in that industry who are likely to be certified eligible for assistance; (2) work with the State to develop an expedited process to accept applications from workers in that industry; (3) process each application for certification within a specified time after receiving the application or after enactment of this Act, whichever is later; and (4) deny an application for certification only if there is clear and compelling evidence that a worker was laid off or a plant was closed as a result of causes other than the ITC's affirmative determination for that industry."
