(Currently, such authority is limited to payments with respect to wartime veterans or veterans discharged from active military service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.)Authorizes the Secretary to lease for up to three years undeveloped land and unused or underutilized buildings belonging to the National Cemetery System and to use the proceeds of such leases and agricultural licenses to assist cemetery operations and the maintenance of cemetery property.Reinstates the one-year time limit that a veterans' benefits claimant has, after notification that a claim application is incomplete, to submit necessary information to the Secretary or lose the right to payment of the benefit in question.Eliminates a reporting requirement relating to advance planning projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs with respect to the obligation of funds for a project specifically authorized by law prior to such obligation."
