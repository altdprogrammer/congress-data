Declares such prohibition shall remain in effect until the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the United States is not engaged in certain active military operations with respect to Iraq; and (2) resuming the importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products would not be inconsistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.Urges the President to take appropriate efforts to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people are not negatively affected by this Act through the transfer to Iraq of food, medicine, and other humanitarian products."
