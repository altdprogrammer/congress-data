Sets forth provisions regarding statements of purpose and need for a highway or transit project, determination of alternatives, and public comment.Makes the Secretary responsible for: (1) developing a schedule for the NEPA process; (2) coordinating efforts to identify and resolve issues that could cause any other Federal agency to oppose or deny project approval or cause delay in completion of the process; (3) developing an agency coordination plan; (4) requesting each relevant Federal agency to participate in the process; and (5) preparing or ensuring that any required environmental impact statement is completed in accordance with the NEPA process."
