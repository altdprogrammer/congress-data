    "text": "Sudan Peace Act - Condemns violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict in Sudan (including the Government of Sudan), the ongoing slave trade there, the Government's use and organization of \"murahalliin\" (or \"mujahadeen\"), Popular Defense Forces (PDF), and regular Sudanese Army units into raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions, and its aerial bombardment of civilian targets. Recognizes that the use of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages as a systematic means to destroy the societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.Provides increased assistance to areas of Sudan that are not controlled by the Government of Sudan to prepare the population for peace and democratic governance.Requires the President to take specified actions against Sudan if the President determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the Government of Sudan has not engaged in good faith negotiations with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) to achieve a peace agreement, or is not in compliance with the terms of any negotiated peace agreement with the SPLM.Expresses the sense of Congress that the United Nations (UN) should help facilitate peace and recovery in Sudan.Directs the President to develop a contingency plan to provide, outside UN auspices, the greatest amount of U.S. Government and privately donated relief to all affected areas in Sudan, including the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and the Blue Nile regions, in the event the Government of Sudan imposes a ban on Operation Lifeline Sudan air transport relief flights.Directs the Secretary to collect information about possible war crimes by all parties to the conflict in Sudan, including slavery, rape, and aerial bombardment of civilian targets."
