States that this Act shall not preclude any authority from securing information as otherwise authorized by law.Directs the Secretary to make reasonable efforts to implement a real-time electronic system.Specifies the circumstances in which information provided by the Secretary from the monitoring system can lawfully be subsequently transmitted.Assesses civil monetary penalties for the failure to communicate information requested by the Secretary and for the unauthorized disclosure of information transmitted by the Secretary. Allows a State to have its own prescription monitoring system to the exclusion of the Federal program so long as the State system provides the information required by this Act to the Federal program in a fashion set forth by the Secretary."
