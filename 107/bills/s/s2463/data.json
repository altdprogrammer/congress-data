    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Defense to require the Secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency and Department of Defense (DOD) Field Activity to ensure that decisions made regarding the consolidation of contract requirements (bundling) are made with a view to providing small businesses with appropriate opportunities to participate in DOD procurements as prime contractors and subcontractors. Limits the authority of any such official to execute an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements with a total value in excess of $5 million. Requires the Secretary to review DOD data collection systems to ensure their capability of identifying each procurement that involves a consolidation in excess of such amount.Amends the Small Business Act to require the Small Business Administration (SBA) to report annually to the President the number and value of consolidations in excess of such amount, including the number of such consolidations that were awarded to small businesses as prime contractors. Requires the SBA Administrator to study the best means to determine the accuracy of certain required market research on bundled contracts to determine whether their anticipated benefits were realized."
