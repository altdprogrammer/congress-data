Sets a limit on the total cost of developing such plan.Requires the Secretary to: (1) engage in significant public outreach in carrying out this Act; and (2) ensure that activities conducted under this Act do not interfere with water compact activities and negotiations being carried out with respect to the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint Rivers."
