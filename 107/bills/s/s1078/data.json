Allows inclusions of sites otherwise excluded from consideration: (1) on a site-by-site basis if financial assistance will protect human health and the environment and promote economic development or facilitate the protection of parks, greenways, or other property used for nonprofit purposes; (2) that were contaminated by a controlled substance; (3) that are certain low-risk petroleum-contaminated sites; or (4) that are mine-scarred land."
