Urges such agency to: (1) make HIV and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) a priority in the foreign assistance program for developing foreign countries; and (2) undertake a comprehensive, coordinated effort to combat HIV and AIDS, including providing programs to strengthen and broaden health care systems infrastructure and capacity to deliver HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals, prevention, and treatment to those afflicted with HIV/AIDS.Authorizes appropriations. Urges that priority be given to programs that address the support and education of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, including AIDS orphans, and prevention strategies for vertical transmission of HIV."
