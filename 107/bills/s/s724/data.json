Eliminates counting Medicaid child presumptive eligibility costs against such allotment.Provides for automatic enrollment under SCHIP for children born to women receiving pregnancy-related assistance under SCHIP.Makes appropriations for FY 2003 through 2006 for the purpose of providing additional allotments to States under SCHIP. Provides that such allotments are available for amounts expended on or after October 1, 2002, for child health assistance for targeted low-income children, as well as for pregnancy-related assistance for targeted low-income pregnant women.Modifies the eligibility criteria for a newborn, removing the requirement that to receive medical assistance under Medicaid the child must be a member of the woman's household and the woman must remain eligible for such assistance.Amends SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) to direct the Commissioner of Social Security to review State agency blindness or disability determinations before any action is taken to implement the determination."
