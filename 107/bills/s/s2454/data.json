Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from commencing or conducting spectrum auctions 31 and 44, currently scheduled for June 19, 2002.Requires the FCC to report to Congress: (1) specifying when it intends to reschedule such auctions; and (2) describing progress made in the transition from analog to digital television and in the assignment and allocation of additional spectrum for advanced mobile communications services that warrants the scheduling of such auctions."
