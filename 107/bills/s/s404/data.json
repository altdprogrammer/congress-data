Authorizes the FCC to: (1) order the losing party to reimburse complaint costs; and (2) impose quintuple punitive damages for frivolous complaints.Repeals certain inconsistent law.Directs the FCC to complete all rulemakings necessary to implement the transition to digital radio no later than February 23, 2002."
