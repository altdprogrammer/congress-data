Requires the Secretary to determine whether the petitioning group meets certain requirements and, if so, to issue such a certification.Requires the International Trade Commission to notify the Secretary immediately whenever it begins an investigation into whether an agricultural commodity is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry producing an agricultural commodity like or directly competitive with the imported agricultural commodity.Directs the Secretary to provide agricultural commodity producers with information about trade adjustment assistance petition and application procedures, benefit allowances, training, and other employment services.Sets forth certain eligibility requirements for the payment of trade adjustment assistance to adversely affected agricultural commodity producers. Limits to $10,000 the maximum annual amount of cash benefits a producer may receive.Provides for the repayment and recovery of overpayments of trade adjustment assistance made to such producers due to fraud. Sets forth penalties for such fraud."
