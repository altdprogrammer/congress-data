States that manufacturer noncompliance with this Act constitutes an unfair method of competition and an unfair or deceptive act or practice affecting commerce within the purview of the Federal Trade Commission Act.Authorizes a vehicle owner or repair facility to bring a civil action in Federal district court for violations of this Act without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties.Instructs the FTC to prescribe a uniform methodology for manufacturer disclosure in writing, and on the Internet.Prohibits the FTC from prescribing rules that interfere with the authority of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency regarding motor vehicle emissions control diagnostics systems."
