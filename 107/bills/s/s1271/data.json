Requires the following Federal agencies, also within one year, to establish one agency point of contact to act as a liaison with small businesses with respect to the collection of information and the control of paperwork: (1) each agency with a head listed at level I on the Executive Schedule; and (2) the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency.Requires each agency to make efforts to: (1) further reduce the paperwork burden for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees; and (2) eliminate any unnecessary paperwork burdens.Establishes a task force to study and report to the Director, specified congressional committees, and the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman on the feasibility of streamlining requirements with respect to small businesses regarding the collection of information and strengthening the dissemination of information.Amends the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 to require each agency to submit, biennially, to the Director and such committees information concerning regulatory enforcement actions taken and civil penalties assessed, including actions and assessments against small businesses."
