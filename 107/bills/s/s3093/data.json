Requires an annual report from the Office to Congress on the status of state interference with Internet use and of U.S. efforts to counter such interference.Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) denounce governments that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to information on the Internet; (2) direct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations to submit a resolution condemning such actions; and (3) deploy technologies aimed at defeating state-directed Internet censorship and the persecution of those who use the Internet."
