Prescribes a process for review of any alleged restriction.Authorizes any person who uses or seeks to use rail service for major train load shipments to or from a facility that has physical access solely to one rail carrier to request, according to a specified procedure, that rail service for such shipments be provided by an existing Class I, Class II, or Class III rail carrier, or a new rail service meeting certain requirements."
