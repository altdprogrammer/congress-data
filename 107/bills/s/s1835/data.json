Includes in the meaning of competing lender not only insured depository institutions but also any person or entity engaged in the business of selling or financing the sale of property or services.States that the authority of any competing lender to take, receive, reserve, or charge interest on any loan or credit sale remains unaffected in States other than the State with such constitutional provision."
