Makes this provision inapplicable to an existing contract to provide such core services, but applicable to renewals or extensions of an existing contract.Amends the Federal criminal code to require the Bureau of Prisons to provide that: (1) any penal or correctional facility or institution, except for nonprofit community correctional confinement (such as halfway houses), confining any person convicted of offenses against the United States shall be under the direction of the Director of the Bureau and shall be managed and maintained by Federal, State, or local government employees; and (2) the housing, safeguarding, protection, and disciplining of any person charged with or convicted of any offense against the United States (with that exception) shall be conducted and carried out by Federal, State, or local government employees."
