    "text": "Small Business Procurement Ombudsman Act of 2002 - Directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to designate a Small Business Procurement Ombudsman to: (1) work with each Federal agency with procurement authority to ensure that small businesses are treated fairly in the procurement process; and (2) establish procedures for addressing concerns received with respect to small businesses and Federal procurement contracting; and (3) complete and submit a required annual report.Requires an annual report from the Ombudsman to the congressional small business committees on the attainment by small businesses of certain contracting and subcontracting goals with major Federal agencies (agencies which annually contract with non-federal entities for the procurement of at least $200 million in goods and services).(Sec. 3) Establishes in each Federal agency having procurement powers (except the SBA) an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization to be responsible for the implementation of small business procurement programs of such agency. Establishes the Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Council as an interagency council to discuss and resolve issues faced by each Office.(Sec. 4) Requires a major Federal agency to submit to the SBA a goal attainment plan upon failure to meet small business procurement goals.Increases the Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns from 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards in a fiscal year to 26 percent for FY 2004, not less than 28 percent for FY 2005, and not less than 30 percent for FY 2006 and thereafter."
