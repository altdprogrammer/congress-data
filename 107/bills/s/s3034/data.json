You can use it the same way you would use the original check.\" Prescribes implementation guidelines, including: (1) indemnity procedures; (2) substitute check warranties; (3) expedited recredit claims for consumers and for banks; (4) procedures for claims; (5) measure of damages; (6) statute of limitations; and (7) consumer education materials."
