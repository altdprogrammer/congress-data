Requires the Secretary to make such data publicly available, including on an Internet website. Requires a periodic audit of such data.Provides that, for as long as the Secretary publishes quality measures to help the public compare the quality of care that nursing facilities provide, these quality measures shall include a quality measure for nursing staff."
