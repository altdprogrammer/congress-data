    "text": "National Mathematics and Science Partnerships Act - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF Director) to establish the following programs of grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) or, in some cases, eligible nonprofit institutions, in support of activities relating to elementary and secondary school mathematics and science teaching and education: (1) Mathematics and Science Education Partnerships with local educational agencies (LEAs); (2) a Teacher Research Stipend Program; (3) establishment of four multidisciplinary Centers for Research on Learning and Education Improvement; (4) education research teacher fellowships, to give research opportunities related to the science of learning to elementary and secondary school teachers of science and mathematics; (5) Robert Noyce Scholarships for teacher recruitment and training, with recipient service commitments; and (6) educational technology research centers.Requires the NSF Director to expand the National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library program to enable dissemination of elementary and secondary science, math, engineering, and technology educational resources, materials, practices, and policies through the Internet and other digital technologies.National Science Education Act - Requires the NSF Director to: (1) establish programs of grants to IHEs for training master teachers and assisting schools to establish master teacher programs, and for providing distance learning in mathematics or science for elementary or secondary school students; (2) disseminate information, jointly with the Secretary of Education, on required courses of study and licensing requirements for teaching careers in elementary or secondary school science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education; and (3) convene a conference for stakeholders in kindergarten-through-12th grade science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education.Requires the NSF Director to make demonstration grants to LEAs for mathematics and science proficiency partnerships with private sector entities. Authorizes the NSF Director to make grants for developing educational materials on energy production and use, energy conservation, and renewable energy for use in elementary and secondary schools.Amends the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 to: (1) require the NSF Director to give priority, in making outreach grants for articulation partnerships between community colleges and secondary schools, to proposals involving secondary schools with a majority of students from groups underrepresented in the science, mathematics and engineering workforce; and (2) authorize the NSF Director to make grants for educational technology assistance enters for schools and for a learning community consortium of associate-degree-granting colleges to encourage women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities to enter and complete programs in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology."
