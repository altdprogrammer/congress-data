Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reconsider each claim that was denied by reason of such requirement. Provides a retroactive effective date for the award of an otherwise valid claim.Extends from ten to 20 years the effectiveness of a determination by the Secretary of a presumption of service-connection for diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents while serving in Vietnam during the Vietnam era."
