Sets forth guidelines for the rule pertaining to expiration dates for contact lenses.Directs the FTC to promulgate a rule to make it an unfair trade practice for a contact lenses industry member to: (1) publish any advertisement or sales presentation relating to contact lenses that represents that they may be obtained without a valid prescription; or (2) sell contact lenses to a consumer or agent of a consumer unless the seller obtains a copy of an unexpired prescription or verifies the prescription by notifying the prescriber of the intended sale."
