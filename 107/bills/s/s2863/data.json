Requires the FCC to determine whether State regulation of broadband services is appropriate or necessary, and, if so, to promulgate regulation guidelines.Prohibits the FCC or any State or political subdivision from requiring a broadband services provider to afford an Internet service provider access to its facilities or services for the purpose of offering broadband services.Prohibits a State or local statute from impeding the ability of any entity to provide broadband services.Requires the manufacturer of equipment used for broadband services to ensure that the equipment is accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.Provides an exception to local exchange carrier unbundled access and collocation requirements with respect to the provision of broadband services.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a national clearinghouse for data and information relating to the deployment of facilities capable of supporting high-speed Internet services.Directs the FCC to conduct a study of wireless technology and the appropriate Federal role in facilitating such technology.Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on ways to promote broadband services through e-government."
