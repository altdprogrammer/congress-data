    "text": "Fuel Economy and Security Act of 2002 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to prescribe average fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles and light trucks manufactured in 2007 and thereafter in order to achieve a combined average fuel economy standard for model year 2016 of 36 miles per gallon.Deletes a provision allowing credits for exceeding such standards to be applied in any of the three model years before the model year in which the credits are earned. Allows any such credits to be transferred to a registry established under this Act. Allows a manufacturer to apply greenhouse gas credits toward any model year after 2006, with a limitation.Eliminates the: (1) requirement for separate calculations of average fuel economy for vehicles manufactured domestically and non-domestically; and (2) credit for dual-fueled (gasoline and alternative) vehicles.Provides a high-occupancy vehicle exception if the vehicle is a hybrid or uses only an alternative fuel.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a national voluntary registry system for industry greenhouse gas trading under which emission reductions are assigned unique identifiers.Directs the Secretary to prescribe a motor vehicle safety standard for rollover crashworthiness that includes: (1) dynamic roof crush standards; (2) improved seat structure and safety belt design; (3) side impact head protection airbags; and (4) roof injury protection measures.Requires the Secretary to establish test criteria for use by manufacturers in determining damage susceptibility, crashworthiness, and the overall safety of vehicles for drivers and passengers. Requires such information to be included within safety label requirements under the Automobile Information Disclosure Act with respect to vehicles manufactured after September 30, 2005."
