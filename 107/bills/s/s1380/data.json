Authorizes such Secretary to propose regulations for adoption at the International Maritime Organization to further implement recommendations contained within the Recovery Plan.Directs the Secretary to: (1) design a right whale research grant program; (2) continue discussions with Canada to coordinate whale programs; and (3) begin discussions with relevant organizations and nations for creating or amending agreements on management measures to reduce fishery interactions and for facilitating collection of information relevant to development of the priority action or recovery plan.Requires a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report on actions and expenditures under the Recovery Plan, incidents of collisions and entanglements, preventive actions, recovery activity litigation, and demonstration project costs."
