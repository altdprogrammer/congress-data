    "text": "Quality Teachers for All Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to require any public elementary or secondary school that receives funds under ESEA to provide to the parents of each student information on: (1) professional qualifications of the student's teachers; and (2) minimum professional qualifications required by the State for teacher certification or licensure.Revises requirements for State plans under ESEA title I (Helping Disadvantaged Students Meet High Standards) part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by State and Local Educational Agencies) to add teacher quality requirements.Eliminates certain part A professional development requirements with respect to instructional aides.Establishes an ESEA title I part A program of grants by the Secretary of Education to provide a Fully Qualified Teacher in Every Classroom. Authorizes States and LEAs, in order to meet the goal of a qualified teacher in every classroom, to carry out specified activities with such grants and also use for the same purpose funds received under: (1) ESEA title II (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program); (2) ESEA title VI (Innovative Education Program Strategies); (3) title II (Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships) of the Higher Education Act of 1965; or (5) the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.Establishes a certification grants program. Authorizes the Secretary to make such grants to SEAs, LEAs, or schools that receive part A assistance, to pay for one-half of the cost of providing financial assistance to teachers in such schools who obtain certification from the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards.Prohibits the use of any ESEA funds for any professional development services for a teacher that are not directly related to the curriculum and content areas in which the teacher provides instruction."
