Makes a State ineligible for Federal payments under this Act unless it has submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary has approved a plan setting forth how the State will use the assistance to provide health insurance or health care assistance to eligible caregivers consistent with the provisions of this Act."
