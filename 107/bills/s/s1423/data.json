(Currently, the exemption from income taxes in such a situation is limited only to a death resulting from an activity or action which occurred outside the United States.)Makes the additional estate tax inapplicable in the case of a U.S. military or civilian employee who died as a result of wounds incurred in a terrorist activity or military action which occurred either inside or outside the United States."
