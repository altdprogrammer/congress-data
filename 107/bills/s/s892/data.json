    "text": "Clean and Renewable Fuels Act of 2001 - Amends the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prohibit, effective January 1, 2002, the sale or dispensing to ultimate consumers of any fuel or additive containing methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) other than in specified nonattainment areas. Provides for phased reductions in MTBE use and for a sale and purchase authorization trading program. Imposes labeling requirements.Prohibits, effective three years after this Act's enactment, the manufacture or introduction into commerce of a fuel or additive containing MTBE or any other ether compound.Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in cases of MTBE contamination of soil or water, to take necessary action to protect human health and the environment. Permits State restrictions on MTBE sale or use. Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator to develop technical guidelines. Authorizes cooperative agreements for voluntary pilot projects.Amends the CAA to require establishment of a petition procedure for exceptions from this Act's restrictions.Limits the aromatic hydrocarbon and olefin contents of reformulated gasoline. Applies certain limitations on toxic air pollutant emissions from baseline vehicles using such fuel to precursors as well.Requires the Administrator: (1) to revise reformulated gasoline performance standards; and (2) upon application of a State Governor, to apply prohibitions on the sale of conventional gasoline in covered areas (those requiring the use of reformulated gasoline) to any nonclassified (opt-in) areas.Updates, and adds to the list of pollutants covered by, emissions \"anti-dumping\" rules.Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations for motor fuel renewable source content."
