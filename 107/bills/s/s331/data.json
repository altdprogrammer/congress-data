    "text": "Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act of 2001 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan that provides mastectomy-related medical and surgical benefits to ensure that, if a mastectomy patient elects breast reconstruction, coverage is provided for: (1) all stages of reconstruction of the affected breast; (2) surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; and (3) prostheses and physical complications of mastectomy, including lymphedemas, as determined appropriate by attending physician and patient.States that such coverage may be subject to deductible and coinsurance provisions consistent with other benefits of the plan.Prohibits a plan from: (1) denying a patient new or renewed enrollment in order to avoid such requirements; or (2) limiting reimbursement or providing incentives to induce an attending provider to provide care inconsistent with such requirements.States that in the case of a group health plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, any plan change to comply with such requirements shall not be treated as terminating the agreement."
