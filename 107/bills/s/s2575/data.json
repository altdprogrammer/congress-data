    "text": "American Land Sovereignty Protection Act - Amends the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from nominating any non-federal property for inclusion on the World Heritage List unless the Secretary: (1) publishes a proposed nomination in the Federal Register and conducts required hearings; (2) considers natural resources in the area, as well as the impact that inclusion would have on existing and future property uses; (3) determines that commercially viable uses of the property and adjacent property within ten miles will not be adversely affected by inclusion; and (4) submits a report to Congress describing the necessity of such inclusion and proposing legislation authorizing such nomination.Requires the Secretary to object to inclusion of property on the World Heritage in Danger list unless the Secretary: (1) submits such report to Congress; and (2) is specifically authorized to assent to such inclusion by an Act of Congress.Prohibits any Federal official from nominating property for designation as a Biosphere Reserve unless the Secretary of State: (1) publishes such proposed nomination and conducts required hearings; (2) makes the same considerations and submits the same type of report as required of the Secretary for inclusion on the World Heritage List and the nomination is specifically authorized by an Act of Congress. Requires such Secretary to object to such a designation unless such report is submitted and such Secretary is specifically authorized to assent to such inclusion by an Act of Congress. Provides transitional provisions for property so designated before the enactment of this Act."
