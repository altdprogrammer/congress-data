Defines \"greenhouse gas\" as: (1) an anthropogenic gaseous constituent of the atmosphere that absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation and influences climate; and (2) an anthropogenic aerosol that absorbs solar radiation and influences climate.Establishes in the Department of Energy: (1) the Office of Climate Change Technology to plan and manage an energy technology research and development program that directly supports the Strategy and advise the Secretary on climate change-related issues; and (2) the Center for Strategic Climate Change Response to support integrated assessment of alternative climate change response scenarios and Strategy implementation, including designing and carrying out an international carbon dioxide sequestration monitoring and data program.Establishes the United States Climate Change Response Strategy Review Board to review the Strategy and updates to it, the President's progress reports, and national laboratory certifications.Authorizes appropriations."
