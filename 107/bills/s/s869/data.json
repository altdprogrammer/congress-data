Limits exemptions to agricultural labor outside of school hours, if the individual is employed by a specified family member on the member's farm. Raises from 16 to 18 years old the minimum age for engaging in hazardous agricultural employment.Increases civil and criminal penalties for child labor violations.Directs the Secretary of Labor and the Director of the Bureau of the Census to compile data biannually from State employment security agencies and from other sources in all the States concerning: (1) the types of industries and occupations in which children under the age of 18 are employed; and (2) cases in which children were employed in violation of Federal child labor prohibitions. Requires each employer to report to the State employment security agency on any injury to an employee under age 18 that results in lost employment time or any illness such individual incurred while at work.Directs the Secretary to establish closer working relationships with non-governmental organizations and with State and local government agencies having responsibility for administering and enforcing labor and safety and health laws. Requires State and local government agencies to inform the Secretary, upon request, about employee injuries and deaths."
