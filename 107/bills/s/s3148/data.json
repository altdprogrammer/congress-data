    "text": "Biological, Chemical, and Radiological Weapons Countermeasures Research Act of 2002 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to make available to manufacturers of terror weapons countermeasures, and to publish, a list of materials that may be used as weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Requires the Secretary to determine countermeasures that diagnose, treat, or prevent infection from biological agents or toxins (\"countermeasures\") for each item on the list.Requires private sector entities that are engaged in certain research to register with the Department of Homeland Security if they wish to benefit from various tax, patent, procurement, liability limitations, and other incentives established under this Act. Classifies such research as: (1) countermeasures; (2) diagnostics to detect, identify, or analyze biological agents or toxins (\"diagnostics\"); and (3) research tools used in the laboratory (\"research tools\") that enable the rapid and effective development of countermeasures.Establishes in the Treasury of the United States a \"Terror Weapon Countermeasure Purchase Fund (TWCPF)\" to purchase, and provide adequate payment for, countermeasures, diagnostics, and research tools.Extends market exclusivity for new drugs that are countermeasures.Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements to indemnify and defend persons or entities: (1) involved in the research, development, and production of countermeasures, diagnostics, or research tools purchased under the TWCPF; or (2) who face civil actions arising from human trials and research, development, and production of countermeasures certified under this Act."
