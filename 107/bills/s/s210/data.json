Permits funds to be used for the information system.Requires the Secretary to cooperate with the Secretaries of Labor, the Interior, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation, and the Attorney General who shall enter into an interdepartmental memorandum of agreement for the implementation of approved plans.Makes the Indian Health Service the lead agency (rather than the Bureau of Indian Affairs).Stipulates that funding under this Act is in addition to existing tribal funding. Provides for interagency fund transfers.Requires the Secretary of HHS to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the program and any statutory barriers to services integration.Makes any State with an alcohol and substance abuse or mental health program targeted to Indian tribes eligible to receive no-cost Federal personnel assignments if it would help the program's success."
