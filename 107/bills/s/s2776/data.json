Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a general management plan (the plan) for the identification, research, protection, and public interpretation of the archaeological protection sites located on Federal lands, and those sites located on private and State lands for which the Secretary has entered into discretionary Cooperative Agreements with their owners for the protection, preservation, maintenance, and administration of their archaeological resources and associated lands.Directs the Secretary to consult with various parties in developing the plan, including: (1) the Governor of New Mexico; and (2) affected Native American pueblos.(Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands and interests within the boundaries of the archaeological protection sites, and access to them, by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or by exchange. Requires the consent of the owner thereof for such transactions. Limits to donation or exchange the Secretary's acquisition authority for lands or interests owned by the State of New Mexico or a local government, except that State trust land may be acquired only by exchange.(Sec. 8) Withdraws all Federal lands within the sites, subject to valid existing rights, from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.(Sec. 9) States that this Act shall not be construed, among other things, to: (1) authorize regulation of privately owned lands within an archaeological protection site; or (2) restrict or limit an Indian tribe from protecting cultural or religious sites on tribal land.(Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations."
