Provides for notification of a change in rating.(Sec. 13) Requires the sanctioning organization for a match and its promoter to provide to the boxing commission of a State or Indian land disclosures of charges, fees, and contractual agreements within seven days of a match of 10 rounds or more.(Sec. 15) Prohibits a promoter from arranging a championship match or a match scheduled for 10 rounds or more unless all participating judges and referees have been licensed by the USBA.
