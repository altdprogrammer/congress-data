    "text": "Engineering, Science, Technology, and Mathematics Education Enhancement Act - ESTM Act - National Science Education Enhancement Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), with respect to teacher professional development activities, to include support for mentoring activities for engineering, science, and technology, and mathematics (ESTM) teachers. Includes information on model ESTM teacher mentoring programs among the information which the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and Science Education (Clearinghouse) is required to disseminate. Includes such mentoring programs under teacher professional development program requirements for State plans, accountability reports, and local activities. Revises ESEA provisions for the allocation and use of funds for the Clearinghouse. Requires such funds to be used to: (1) solicit and gather qualitative and evaluative materials and programs, review their evaluation, rank their effectiveness, and distribute results of reviews, as well as excerpts of materials and links to Internet sites and information on-line communities of users to teachers; and (2) establish an Internet site offering a search mechanism to assist site visitors in identifying information on ESTM education instructional materials and programs.Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants for summer professional development institutes for teachers. Includes providing technology training software and instructional materials to teachers among local uses of ESEA school technology resource grants. Requires a portion of each ESEA 21st Century Community Learning Centers program grant to be used to provide after-school day care services that focus on science activities.Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to: (1) make grants to State or local educational agencies (SEAs or LEAs), elementary or middle schools, or consortia to hire master teachers; (2) disseminate information on required courses of study for careers in ESTM education; (3) establish a program under which grants may be made to SEAs or LEAs, elementary or middle schools, or consortia for instruction of teachers for kindergarten through the 12th grade on the use of information technology in the classroom; (4) convene an annual ESTM business education conference; and (5) establish a committee for interagency coordination of science education programs. Authorizes the Director to make competitive awards to develop partnerships for distance learning of ESTM education to SEAs or LEAs or to elementary, middle, or secondary schools, under any NSF grant program for activities in which distance learning is integrated into the education process in kindergarten through the 12th grade. Directs the President, acting through the NSF, to provide scholarships to teachers at public schools in kindergarten through the 12th grade to participate in Federal, State, or private research programs, in order to provide opportunities for teachers to expand their knowledge of ESTM and research techniques.Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to treat technology training (tutoring teachers in the uses of classroom technology) as community service by college students under the work-study program.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to Congress on specified aspects of a comprehensive approach to providing technologically competent teachers for U.S. schools."
