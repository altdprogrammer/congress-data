    "text": "Rural Electromagnetic Spectrum Access Act of 2002 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in order to facilitate the deployment of wireless based services in rural areas, when more than one license is available within a single block of electromagnetic spectrum, to award at least one such license for a rural service area or similarly sized geographic area. Requires the FCC, for each class of licenses or permits granted through the use of a competitive bidding process, to establish a competitive bidding methodology which avoids excessive concentration of licenses and includes as licensees small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. Directs the FCC to: (1) conduct biennial studies on the availability of wireless services in rural areas; (2) design systems of competitive bidding by rural areas; and (3) facilitate the deployment of wireless services in rural areas by license recipients."
