Authorizes the SEC to set and adjust rates of basic pay for all SEC employees, including additional compensation and benefits if the same type are then being provided under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Federal Housing Finance Board, the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board, the Farm Credit Administration, or the Office of Thrift Supervision.Directs the SEC to develop an implementation plan for inclusion in its annual program performance report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Requires a special report to specified congressional committees and the Office of Personnel Management.(Sec. 7) Instructs the SEC Office of Economic Analysis to study and report to Congress on the extent to which investors receive the benefits of fee reductions effected under this Act. Prescribes factors for consideration."
