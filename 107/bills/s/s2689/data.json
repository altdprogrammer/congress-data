Sets forth certain program elements, including to: (1) locate IBIAs in an area with bridges or tunnels with high traffic volume, significant commercial activity, and that have experienced backups and delays since September 11, 2001; and (2) ensure that U.S. Customs officers stationed in any IBIA on the Canadian side of the border and Canadian customs officers stationed in any IBIA on the United States side of the border are vested with the authority to carry out their duties and enforce U.S. law and Canadian law, respectively."
