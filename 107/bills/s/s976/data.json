Requires an independent scientific panel to identify the quality and quantity of water needed to achieve such objectives. Requires the Secretary: (1) and the heads of appropriate Federal agencies to develop a permanent governance structure for such program; and (2) to give first priority to meeting obligations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 when allocating the environmental water account and program assets. Requires public participation in the program. Outlines program compliance requirements and conditions on the use of available program funds.Authorizes the Secretary and agency heads to work with State agencies in conducting a comprehensive assessment of California water demands and resources that take into consideration State, regional, and local circumstances. Requires the Secretary to: (1) recommend additional California water supply projects and activities; (2) develop and implement a related grant program; (3) establish a competitive loan and grant program to assist State and local agencies in financing projects not included in the Bay-Delta program; (4) recommend appropriate funding levels to implement chosen projects and activities; and (5) coordinate and manage activities consistently with the California ecosystem program, the Bay-Delta program, and the water supply program."
