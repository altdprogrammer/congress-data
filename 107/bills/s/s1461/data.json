    "text": "Airline Passenger Safety Enhancement Act of 2001 - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to: (1) study how the performance of security functions at U.S. airports should be organized and carried out, in cooperation with air carriers and airport administrators, to secure the safety of passengers and workers in all areas of airports and in the aircraft boarded at such airports; and (2) develop a plan for ensuring security at U.S. airports.Amends Federal aviation law to require the screening of passengers and property that will be carried in an aircraft cabin to be performed by FAA employees or other U.S. employees. (Currently, screening is carried out by employees or agents of an air carrier, interstate air carrier, or foreign air carrier). Requires the Administrator to direct U.S. airport operators to make immediate arrangements for armed, uniformed law enforcement personnel to be stationed at passenger and property screening points at airports to monitor the performance of such screening and to be stationed at airport employee security checkpoints there.Requires U.S. employees under the direction of the FAA to perform all functions relating to security of passengers and airport personnel at U.S. airports. Imposes a fee of not more than $1 per domestic flight segment for such security operations.Directs the Administrator to develop a plan to provide small- to medium-size airports with technical support to enhance security operations, including financial assistance to defray their costs."
