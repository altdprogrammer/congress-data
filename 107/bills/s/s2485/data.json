Extends, through December 31, 2006, treatment free of any duties, quantitative restrictions, limitations, or consultation levels to certain apparel articles imported into the United States from ATPEA beneficiary countries. Sets forth penalties for exporters and countries that have engaged in transshipment (preferential treatment claimed for an apparel on the basis of material false information concerning country of origin or manufacture) with respect to such articles from an ATPEA beneficiary country."
