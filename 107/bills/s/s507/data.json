Authorizes appropriations.Authorizes the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor to establish Immigration and Naturalization Service, Executive Office of Immigration Review, and Department of Labor operations in the Commonwealth.Directs the President to report to specified congressional committees an evaluation of the overall effect of the transition program and the Immigration and Nationality Act upon the Commonwealth.Prohibits the Commonwealth from permitting an increase in the total number of alien workers present there on the date of enactment of this Act.
