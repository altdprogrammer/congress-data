Terminates on December 31, 2005 (currently, 1995), the authority to close or realign such installations.Requires base closure or realignment cost saving or return on investment selection criteria to be based on the total cost and savings to the Federal Government.Requires the Secretary, in making closure or realignment recommendations, to consider any notice received from a local government approving such closure or realignment.Allows privatization in place of a military installation recommended for closure or realignment only if privatization is a method specified in the Commission's recommendation and it is determined to be the most cost-effective method of implementation of the recommendation."
