    "date": "2002-04-11", 
    "text": "Martin Luther King, Jr. Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2002 - Title I: Uniform and Nondiscriminatory Election Technology and Administration Requirements - Requires each voting system used in an Federal election (with specified exceptions) to: (1) permit the voter to verify his or her votes on the ballot before the ballot is cast and counted; and (2) provide the voter with the opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error before the ballot is cast and counted (including the opportunity to correct the error through the issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error). Provides that, if the voter selects votes for more than one candidate for a single office, the voting system must: (1) notify the voter that he or she has selected more than one candidate for a single office on the ballot; (2) notify him or her before the ballot is cast and counted of the effect of casting multiple votes for the office; and (3) provide the opportunity to correct the ballot before the ballot is cast and counted.(Sec. 101) Allows a State or locality that uses a paper ballot voting system, a punchcard voting system, or a central count voting system (including mail-in absentee ballots or mail-in ballots) to meet the requirements of this title by: (1) establishing a voter education program specific to that voting system that notifies each voter of the effect of casting multiple votes for an office; and (2) providing the voter with instructions on how to correct the ballot before it is cast and counted (including instructions on how to correct the error through issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error). Requires the voting system to ensure that any required notification preserves the privacy of the voter and the confidentiality of the ballot.Requires the voting system to: (1) produce a permanent paper record with a manual audit capacity; and (2) provide the voter with an opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error before the permanent paper record is produced. Requires the printed record produced to be available as an official record for any recount conducted with respect to any Federal election in which the system is used.Requires the voting system to: (1) be accessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired in a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and participation (including privacy and independence) as for other voters; (2) satisfy such requirement through the use of at least one direct recording electronic voting system or other voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities at each polling place; and (3) meet the voting system standards for disability access if purchased with funds made available under title II of this Act on or after January 1, 2007.Outlines requirements for voting system alternative language accessibility.Prohibits the error rate of the voting system in counting ballots from exceeding the error rate standards established under the voting system standards issued and maintained by the Director of the Office of Election Administration of the Federal Election Commission (FEC).(Sec. 102) Provides that, if an individual declares that he or she is a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which he or she desires and is eligible to vote in a Federal election, but the individual's name does not appear on the official list of eligible voters for the polling place, or an election official asserts that the individual is not eligible to vote, such individual shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot according to specified procedures.Requires the appropriate State or local election official to cause voting information to be publicly posted at each polling place on the day of each Federal election.Limits to the casting of a provisional ballot only any individual who votes in a Federal election for any reason, including a Federal or State court order, after the time set for poll closing by a State law in effect ten days before the election.(Sec. 103) Requires each State, acting through the chief State election official, to implement an interactive computerized statewide voter registration list that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the State and assigns a unique identifier to each one (computerized list). Exempts from such requirement a State in which, under a State law in effect continuously on and after the date of enactment of this Act, there is no voter registration requirement for individuals in the State with respect to Federal elections. Requires: (1) the computerized list to be accessible to each State and local election official in the State; (2) the appropriate State or local election official to perform list maintenance with respect to the computerized list on a regular basis; and (3) with certain exceptions, the Commissioner of Social Security to provide, upon request from a State or locality maintaining an interactive computerized statewide voter registration list, only such information as is necessary to determine the eligibility of an individual to vote under State law. States that any State or locality that receives such information may only share it with election officials.Prescribes requirements a State shall impose for voting in person or by mail if: (1) the individual is registered to vote in a jurisdiction but has not previously voted in a Federal election in the State; or (2) the individual has not previously voted in such an election in the jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction is located in a State that does not have a computerized list complying with the requirements of this title. Allows an individual who desires to vote in person or by mail, but who does not meet the necessary requirements, to cast a provisional ballot.
