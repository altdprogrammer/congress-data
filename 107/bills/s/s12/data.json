Requires the Director to report to Congress on student loan forgiveness programs.(Sec. 6) Requires the Director to report to Congress on initiatives that the Peace Corps intends to pursue with eligible countries where the presence of Peace Corps volunteers would facilitate a greater understanding that a universe exists of commonly shared human values and aspirations.
