Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President, upon determining that at least one harmful substance is being or has been released in a presidentially declared disaster area, to carry out a program for the protection, assessment, monitoring, and study of the health and safety of community members, volunteers, and responding emergency personnel. Permits such program to include: (1) collecting and analyzing environmental exposure data (2) developing and disseminating educational materials; (3) providing the public access to current information on continuing releases; (4) training and certifying volunteers and workers in the use of personal protection equipment; (5) identifying, performing baseline health assessments on, taking biological samples from, and establishing an exposure registry of exposed community members, volunteers, and workers; (6) studying the long-term health impacts of any exposures through epidemiological studies; and (7) providing assistance to participants in such registries and studies in determining eligibility for health coverage and identifying appropriate health services.Requires participation in any such registries and studies to be voluntary.Allows the President to carry out such a program through a cooperative agreement with a medical or academic institution, or a consortium of such institutions, that is: (1) located in close proximity to the area; and (2) experienced in environmental or occupational health and safety. Requires the President, or the institution or consortium, to report on the study to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency."
