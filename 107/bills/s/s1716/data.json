    "text": "Global Climate Change Act of 2001 - Provides for establishment of a number of new Government entities, including: (1) a National Office of Climate Change Action and an integrated program office for the global change research program within the Office of Science and Technology Policy; (2) an interagency climate change action task force to develop a national strategy for, among other things, substantially reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy efficiency research and development; and (3) a Science and Technology Assessment Service in the legislative branch.Requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a comprehensive measurement and verification system for greenhouse gas emissions. Requires the task force to initiate a mandatory emissions reporting system for the industrial, energy-producing, and transportation sectors.Requires the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish an atmospheric greenhouse gas monitoring and verification program; (2) conduct research on climate variability in the Asia-Pacific sector; (3) initiate a program for development of innovative greenhouse gas standards and measurement technologies; (4) establish a technology transfer program for emissions reduction and energy efficiency technologies; and (5) conduct regional coastal vulnerability assessments, develop a national coastal adaptation plan, and provide financial assistance.Amends the National Climate Program Act to, among other things: (1) include in the program methods to guide decision making on land use, water hazards, and related issues; (2) extend funding; and (3) require submission to Congress of a plan of action.Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to authorize the Secretary to perform research to develop standards and technology enabling reduced production in the United States of greenhouse gases associated with global warming.Requires the Director to establish a program of research on global climate change standards and processes.Authorizes the Director to: (1) hold a portion of competitions in areas designed to develop and commercialize technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) develop a program to support \"green\" manufacturing technologies, emphasizing energy efficiency of electric motors.Directs the President to: (1) establish within the Department of Commerce a National Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation Program to address regional impacts; and (2) establish and maintain an integrated ocean and coastal observing system.Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish a program to explore the use of geospatial information to address governmental needs to forecast a coastal zone adaptation plan."
