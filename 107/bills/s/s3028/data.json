Permits this in cases where the debtor is the sponsor of an employee pension benefit plan under certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and such plan is likely to be terminated under title IV of ERISA or substantially underfunded by the debtor, resulting in a hardship to the participants or beneficiaries.Allows the representative to be heard with respect to a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the debtor or with respect to a plan of reorganization. Permits such participants and beneficiaries to employ counsel and other professionals who shall be compensated from the debtor's estate."
