Declares, however, that if a regularly scheduled general election for the office will be held during such period or 30 days thereafter, no special election shall be held and the Member elected in such regularly scheduled general election shall fill the vacancy upon election. Allows such appointed individual to be a candidate in such a special election or in such a regularly scheduled general election."
