States that the President should explore measures to support and complement multilateral efforts to respond to the global coffee crisis. Urges private sector coffee buyers and roasters to work with the United States to find a solution to the crisis which is economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable for all interested parties, and which addresses oversupply in the world coffee market."
