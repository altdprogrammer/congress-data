Calls on the prosecutorial organs of the Indonesian Government to indict and bring to trial the senior military commanders described in a September 1, 2000, statement by that Government as suspects in the mass killings following the August 1999 East Timor referendum.Calls for: (1) State Department officials, at every appropriate meeting with officials of the Indonesian Government, to stress the importance of ending the climate of impunity which shields those individuals suspected of perpetrating, collaborating in, or covering up extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses in Indonesia, including senior members of the Indonesian military; and (2) the President to consider the willingness of that Government to make substantive progress in judicial reform and in the criminal accountability of those responsible for human rights abuse on the island of Timor when determining the level of financial support provided by the United States to Indonesia."
