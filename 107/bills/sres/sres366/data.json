The summary of that version is repeated here.)Condemns any publication or program that lends legitimacy to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Expresses the belief that such heinous propaganda, especially in the Arab world, incites popular sentiment against Jews and the State of Israel, rather than promoting religious tolerance and preparing Arab populations for peace with Israel. Commends the Department of State for denouncing the \"Horseman Without a Horse\" television series. Urges the Government of Egypt and other Arab governments: (1) not to permit their government-controlled television stations to broadcast this program or other racist and untrue material; and (2) to vigorously and publicly condemn anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry."
