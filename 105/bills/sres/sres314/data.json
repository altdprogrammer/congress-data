Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary should: (1) gather sufficient data on the provision of non-therapy ancillary services by skilled nursing facilities paid under the PPS in order to develop the appropriate case mix adjustment; and (2) periodically report to the Congress on the development of such an adjustment which reflects a patient's medical needs requiring such ancillary services."
