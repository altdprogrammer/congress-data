Res. 209 to establish budgetary levels for FY 1999 through 2003 for Federal revenues, new budget authority, total budget outlays, and revenues and outlays of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds. Authorizes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to file one set of revisions to the levels, amounts, and allocations provided by this resolution and permits such revisions to reflect only legislation enacted in the 105th Congress and not assumed in this resolution. Directs the chairman, upon making revisions, to reduce balances of direct spending and receipts for any fiscal year to zero. Requires this resolution to: (1) take effect on the earlier of the date the Congress adjourns sine die or the 105th Congress expires; and (2) expire on the date a concurrent budget resolution for FY 1999 is agreed to. Directs the chairman, upon adoption of this resolution, to file committee spending allocations pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974."
