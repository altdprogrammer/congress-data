Expresses the condolences of the Senate to the Byrd family and notes the family's religious faith, under the leadership of James Sr., and Stella Byrd, and the Reverend Kenneth Lyons, Pastor of the Greater New Bethel Baptist Church, that has helped the family through this most trying time. Commends the leadership shown by Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles, city of Jasper Mayor R.C. Horn, and other community leaders in responding to this tragedy. Urges: (1) that law enforcement officials at all appropriate levels continue with the full and fair investigation into all the facts of the case; and (2) prosecutors to proceed with a fair and speedy trial to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous crime to justice."
