Calls on the Government of Gabon to: (1) take further measures to ensure the organization and administration of a transparent and credible election and to ensure that the national election commission is able to independently carry out its duties; and (2) further welcome the Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, and other international non-governmental organizations to aid the organization of, and monitor, the December 1998 presidential election in Gabon in an effort to ensure that elections in Gabon are free and fair. Urges the U.S. Government to continue to work with the international community, and through appropriate nongovernmental organizations, to help create an environment which guarantees free and fair elections. Urges the U.S. Government and the international community to continue to encourage and support the institutionalization of democratic processes and the establishment of conditions for good governance in Gabon."
