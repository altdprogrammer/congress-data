Calls on all private militia to disband to end the continuing threat to peace and stability in the Republic of Congo. Reaffirms support for constitutional government, the rule of law, human rights, and democratic processes in the Republic of Congo and calls upon regional African leaders to support the preservation of a democratic political system in the country. Declares that the removal of the democratically elected Government of the Republic of Congo by other than democratic means would severely restrict the bilateral relationship between the United States and the Republic of Congo, including the suspension of most bilateral assistance from the United States to the Republic of Congo. Encourages the U.S. Government to state publicly its strong support for a democratic government in the Republic of Congo and the peaceful transfer of power in that country."
