    "text": "Declares that at the upcoming U.S.-China summit the President should: (1) secure from China's leaders a pledge to remove the names on an official reentry blacklist, which now contains the names of more than 50 Chinese citizens living in the United States who cannot return to China because of their peaceful advocacy of greater rights and freedom; and (2) visit family members of victims of the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square. Declares that in the context of the upcoming U.S.-China summit, the President should urge the Chinese leaders to: (1) engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama with the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious autonomy in Tibet; (2) revise China's security laws, including the provisions on \"endangering state security\" added to the criminal code in March 1997; (3) release unconditionally all imprisoned political, religious, and labor activists detained for their peaceful, nonviolent involvement in public protests; (4) review the sentences of more than 2,000 convicted so-called \"counterrevolutionaries\" to consider releasing those convicted solely for exercising their internationally recognized rights of free speech and association; (5) encourage greater cooperation by the Chinese Government with the United Nation's human rights mechanisms and greater transparency in China's legal and detention system; (6) ease religious repression by abolishing the requirement that all religious sites register with the official Religious Affairs Bureau and implementing the 1994 recommendations of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerances; (7) lift Government mandated quotas on the number of monks and nuns in monasteries and nunneries, end the Government's current \"reeducation\" campaign, and immediately reinstate all monks and nuns expelled from their monasteries for failing to denounce the Dalai Lama; (8) allow access by credible, independent human rights or humanitarian organizations to the nine-year-old boy recognized by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama; and (9) allow regular, unmonitored access to Tibet and Xinjiiang province of China by independent human rights monitors."
