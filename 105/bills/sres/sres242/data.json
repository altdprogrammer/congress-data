    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President: (1) should not go to China to attend a summit with President Jiang until he has provided a full disclosure to the Congress concerning the transfer of U.S. satellite and missile technology to China and until U.S. policy towards China has been formulated more effectively to protect U.S. national security, economic, and human rights interests; (2) should submit a report to the Congress after the proposed summit in China concerning his progress in securing the release of persons remaining imprisoned in China and Tibet and other significant steps to improve human rights; and (3) in addition to applauding narrow trade concessions from China, should ensure that the highest levels of diplomacy are used to open the entire Chinese market to U.S. trade and investment. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) China's accession to the World Trade Organization should be conditioned on China's compliance with past market access commitments and further steps to open China's market to U.S. investment and trade in goods and services; and (2) the United States should not jeopardize cooperation with and assistance to the Government of Taiwan to appease the Chinese Government, but instead should maintain unambiguously its legal commitments to help maintain Taiwan's capacity for self-defense while calling upon the Chinese Government to renounce the use of force against the people of Taiwan."
