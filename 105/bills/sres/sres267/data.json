    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President, acting through the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), should: (1) aggressively seek to secure emergency famine relief for the people of Sudan; (2) immediately take steps to distribute that famine relief to affected areas in Sudan; (3) encourage and assist Operation Lifeline Sudan and the ongoing efforts to develop relief distribution networks for affected areas of Sudan outside of the umbrella and associated constraints of the Operation; (4) begin providing development assistance in areas of Sudan not controlled by the regime in Khartoum with the goals of building self-sufficiency and avoiding the same conditions which have created the current crisis and providing for longer-term economic, civil, and democratic development, without regard to the constraints that now compromise the ability of the Operation to distribute famine relief or that could constrain future multilateral relief arrangements. Calls for the AID Administrator to submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on AID's progress toward meeting these goals. Calls for the President, both bilaterally and through the United Nations, to aggressively seek to change the terms by which the Operation and other groups are prohibited from providing necessary relief according to the true needs of the people of Sudan."
