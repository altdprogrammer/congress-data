Urges the United States, in consultation with other countries in the Americas, to explore areas for enhancing cooperation and collaboration, including the strengthening of existing inter-American organizations and arrangements, in order to address shared problems relating to subregional and Hemisphere-wide foreign policy and security-related issues."
