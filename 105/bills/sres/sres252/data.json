Calls for the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN to: (1) propose to the UN Security Council a meeting with UN representatives from India and Pakistan to discuss the security situation in South Asia; and (2) raise the issue of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute with the Security Council and promote the establishment of a UN-sponsored mediator for the conflict."
