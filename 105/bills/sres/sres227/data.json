Calls upon: (1) the President to carry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect to India and invoke all sanctions therein; (2) the Government of India to take immediate steps to reduce tensions that this step has caused; (3) the Governments of Pakistan and the People's Republic of China and all governments to exercise restraint in response to the Indian nuclear tests, in order to avoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in South Asia; (4) all governments in the region to take steps to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; and (5) the Government of India to enter into a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which would cover all Indian nuclear research facilities at the earliest possible time."
