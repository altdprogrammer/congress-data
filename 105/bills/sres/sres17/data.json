    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that the advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention should be subject to certain conditions, binding upon the President, which include: (1) U.S. participation in Amendment Conferences with respect to proposed amendments to the Convention; (2) presidential certification of Russia's compliance with certain data declarations under the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding dated September 23, 1989, and agreement to implement the Bilateral Destruction Agreement; (3) presidential consultation with the Senate with respect to noncompliance of parties to the Convention, and specified measures to take in the event of continuing noncompliance; (4) the Russian share in financing of the Convention; and (5) presidential consultation with the Senate with respect to any U.S. unilateral reduction of chemical weapons. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the Convention should be subject to certain declarations, including calls for: (1) further reductions of U.S. armed forces or armaments; (2) U.S. retaliation with respect to the use of chemical weapons against U.S. military forces or civilians; (3) maintenance of a U.S. chemical defense program; (4) vigorous enforcement of the Convention; (5) the United States, in exchange for providing financial assistance for the destruction of Russian chemical weapons, to require Russia to destroy its chemical weapons stocks at a proportional rate to the destruction of U.S. chemical weapons stocks; and (6) the President to give priority to development of nonchemical, nonlethal alternatives to riot control agents. Declares that the President should consult with the Senate on an urgent basis to determine whether adherence to the Convention remains in the U.S. national interest if a non-party country expands its chemical weapons arsenals so as to jeopardize supreme U.S. national interests. Requires the President to notify specified congressional committees of any determination that Russia is not in compliance with the Convention, together with an explanation of why it is in U.S. national interests to continue as a party to the Convention."
