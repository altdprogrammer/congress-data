Calls for the international community to respond affirmatively to the call of the Contact Group for the imposition of broad-based sanctions against the Serbian Government if it fails to prevent additional atrocities by the police and paramilitary units under its control or does not otherwise comply immediately with the terms set forth by that Group."
