    "text": "Reaffirms the view that the status quo on Cyprus is unacceptable and detrimental to U.S. interests. Considers that lasting peace and stability on Cyprus could be best secured by a process of complete demilitarization leading to the withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces, the cessation of foreign arms transfers to Cyprus, and the provision of alternative internationally acceptable and effective security arrangements with guaranteed rights for both communities as negotiated by the parties. Supports the commitment by President Clinton to give increased attention to Cyprus and to make the search for a solution a priority of U.S. foreign policy, as witnessed by the appointment of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus. Calls upon the parties to lend their full support and cooperation to U.S., United Nations, and other international efforts to promote resolution of the Cyprus problem: (1) on the basis of international law, the provisions of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and democratic principles, including respect for human rights; and (2) in accordance with the norms and requirements for accession to the European Union."
