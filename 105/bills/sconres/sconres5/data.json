Calls upon: (1) the Alliance to extend invitations to accession negotiations to those nations who seek membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and who are ready to make a net contribution to the Alliance's security by 1999, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia; and (2) the President to fully use his offices to facilitate the objectives and commitments described in this Act. Reserves the right of advice and consent to the ratification of treaties and pledges to review the results of accession negotiations between the Council and prospective NATO members."
