    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Levels and Amounts Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking Title III: Sense of Congress and the Senate Sets forth the congressional budget for the Government for FY 1999, including the appropriate budgetary levels for FY 2000 through 2003, and revised budgetary levels for FY 1998. Title I: Levels and Amounts - Lists recommended budgetary levels and amounts, for FY 1998 through 2003, with respect to: (1) Federal revenues; (2) new budget authority; (3) budget outlays; (4) deficits; and (5) public debt. (Sec. 102) Sets forth for such fiscal years specified amounts of revenues and outlays of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. (Sec. 103) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority and budget outlays for specified major functional categories for FY 1998 through 2003. Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking - Authorizes the Senate to reduce revenue and spending aggregates and allocations only for legislation that reduces revenues by providing family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth, if such legislation will not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus for: (1) FY 1999; (2) the period of FY 1999 through 2003; or (3) the period of FY 2004 through 2008. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Senate to increase revenue aggregates for legislation which reserves the Federal share of receipts from tobacco legislation only for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. (Sec. 203) Permits the Senate to increase revenue and spending aggregates and allocations only for legislation that reauthorizes and reforms the Superfund program to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous waste sites if such legislation will not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus for: (1) FY 1999; (2) the period of FY 1999 through 2003; or (3) the period of FY 2004 through 2008. Authorizes increased aggregates, allocations, and outlays in the case of a reported Senate bill to reform the Superfund program that does not exceed specified limits on budget authority and outlays for FY 1999 and the period of FY 1999 through 2003. (Sec. 204) Permits the Senate Budget Committee Chairman to reserve estimated reductions in new budget authority and outlays resulting from changes in legislation affecting specified programs, if contained in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, for purposes of offsetting limited additional outlays for discretionary highway programs and additional budget authority for discretionary transit programs as called for in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998. Describes programs subject to reductions in mandatory spending. Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to veterans' compensation for post-service smoking related illnesses. Requires the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of Management and Budget, and the General Accounting Office to study and report to specified Senate officials on whether such illnesses should be compensable. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the Chairman of the Budget Committee, if the Line Item Veto Act is ruled unconstitutional, to make adjustments to the allocations and aggregates in this resolution to reflect the President's cancellations becoming null and void. (Sec. 206) Establishes certain discretionary spending limits in the Senate for each of FY 1999 through 2002 for various categories, including defense, discretionary, nondefense, and violent crime reduction. Sets forth related provisions regarding points of order against legislation that causes such limits to be exceeded, waivers, and appeals.
