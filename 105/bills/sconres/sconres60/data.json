Confirms the U.S. commitment to an independent, sovereign, secure, and democratic Mongolia. Encourages Mongolia's efforts: (1) to develop its democratic and free market institutions; and (2) toward economic development that is compatible with environmental protection. Commends: (1) Mongolia for its foresight in environmental protection through the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (and encourages Mongolia to obtain the goals illustrated in the plan); and (2) Mongolia's efforts to strengthen civilian control over the Mongolia military through parliamentary oversight (and recommends that Mongolia be admitted into the Partnership for Peace initiative at the earliest opportunity). Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) support Mongolia, through the U.S. vote in international financial institutions and in the administration of U.S. bilateral assistance programs, in its efforts to expand economic opportunity through free market structures and policies; (2) assist Mongolia in its efforts to integrate itself into international economic structures, such as the World Trade Organization; and (3) promote efforts to increase commercial investment in Mongolia by U.S. business and promote policies which will increase economic cooperation and development between the United States and Mongolia."
