    "text": "Declares that it is U.S. policy with respect to the People's Republic of China to: (1) encourage freedom and democracy in China; (2) deter the Chinese Government from engaging in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security interests and the peace and security of the Asian Pacific region; (3) encourage such Government to make progress towards improving overall human rights conditions in China and Tibet and to channel its emerging power and influence along paths that are conducive to peace, stability, and development in the region; and (4) support integration of China into the community of nations. Urges President Clinton to communicate U.S. policy to President Jiang during their summit meeting and to demand that China immediately cease: (1) persecuting Chinese Christians; (2) coercive population control practices; (3) efforts to subvert the American political process; (4) nonreciprocal tariff and nontariff barriers relating to U.S. imports; (5) resistance to transparency in its trade practices; (6) exports to the United States of products made with prison labor; (7) activities leading to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced ballistic missile technology; and (8) evasion of U.S. export controls and other laws. Reaffirms the policy promulgated in the Taiwan Relations Act and insists that such Act be fully implemented by the President."
