Supports report recommendations that call on: (1) the People's Republic of China to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama on a solution to the question of Tibet, to ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people, to end practices which threaten to erode the distinct cultural, religious, and national identity of the Tibetan people, and to cease policies which result in the movement of Chinese people to Tibetan territory; (2) the United Nations General Assembly to resume its debate on the question of Tibet; and (3) the Dalai Lama to enter into discussions with the Chinese Government on a solution to the question of Tibet. Commends: (1) the appointment by the Secretary of State of a U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues; and (2) the President for publicly urging President Jiang Zemin, during their recent summit meeting in Beijing, to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Calls on: (1) the People's Republic of China to release from detention the nine-year old Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, to his home in Tibet from which he was taken on May 17,1995, and to allow him to pursue his religious studies; and (2) the President to continue to work to secure an agreement to begin substantive negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama."
