    "text": "College Affordability and High Standards Act of 1997 - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to State or local educational agencies to carry out specified activities under three-year demonstration programs to expand access for low-income individuals to advanced placement (AP) incentive programs. Declares that such a grant shall be awarded for a fiscal year only if the College Board maintains in that fiscal year the minimum amount of its expenditure for the previous fiscal year for the College Board Fee Assistance Program. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to make AP programs a priority for Byrd Scholarships, Javits Gifted and Talented Students, Upward Bound, Eisenhower professional development, Star Schools, and education technology grants. Requires each institution of higher learning receiving HEA assistance to distribute to secondary school counselors or AP coordinators in the State information on academic credit given to students at the institution for AP test scores. Revises HEA requirements for grants to States for advanced placement test fee reimbursement programs. Extends the authorization of appropriations."
