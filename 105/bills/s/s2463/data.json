(Sec. 114) Requires certain numbered certifications to the Congress with respect to any letter of offer to sell (Government-to- Government sale), or license for export (commercial sale) of, major defense equipment in the amount of $14 million or more, or defense articles or services in the amount of $50 million or more, to include a description of any offset agreement, including its dollar amount. (Sec. 115) Extends to exports of defense articles or services the current prohibition against incentive payments by U.S. suppliers to satisfy any offset agreement with a foreign country to which such articles or services are sold. Subtitle C: Stockpiling of Defense Articles for Foreign Countries - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the maximum value of additions to stockpiles in foreign countries in FY 1999. Makes amounts available for such stockpiles in South Korea and Thailand. (Sec. 122) Authorizes the President to transfer to South Korea and Thailand certain obsolete or surplus defense articles in return for concessions to be negotiated by the Secretary of Defense. Requires the value of such concessions to be at least equal to the fair market value of the transferred items. Requires the President to notify the Congress of the proposed transfer, including the identity of the items to be transferred and the concessions to be received. Terminates transfer authority five years after enactment of this Act. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous Provisions - Prohibits armed forces or other security forces of a foreign country that is ineligible for international military education and training (IMET), or for which such assistance is restricted, from receiving IMET under any other provision of law, unless: (1) certain congressional committees are notified at least 15 days in advance of such training; (2) the foreign country is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or major non- NATO ally; (3) the foreign country is Austria, Finland, South Korea, Singapore, or Spain (high-income foreign countries); (4) the training is related to an operation undertaken to save the lives or property of U.S. citizens; or (5) the training is reportable under title V of the National Security Act of 1947. Directs the Secretary of State to report to specified congressional committees on measures taken to ensure that all IMET activities are conducted in accordance with U.S. foreign policy objectives. (Sec. 132) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise requirements for the President's annual military assistance report to Congress. Requires such report to include by category: (1) whether defense articles were furnished with the financial assistance of the U.S. Government, including through loans and guarantees; and (2) the provision of law pursuant to which any IMET activities were conducted.

Authorizes the President to transfer certain naval guided missile destroyers and frigates to such countries. (Sec. 203) Declares that the value of certain naval vessels transferred on a grant basis to foreign countries shall not be included with regard to certain limits placed on the aggregate value of excess defense articles that can be transferred to such countries. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the President, with respect to the transfer of naval vessels on a lease-sale basis, to transfer such vessels under the terms of the lease (with lease payments suspended for the term of the lease), if the country to which the vessel is to be leased simultaneously enters into a foreign military sales agreement for the transfer of title to the leased vessel. (Sec. 206) Authorizes the President to convert to foreign military sales certain previous leases of frigate class and tank landing class vessels to foreign countries.
