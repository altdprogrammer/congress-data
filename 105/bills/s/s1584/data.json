    "text": "Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998 - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to review and reevaluate FAA regulations regarding: (1) the equipment required to be carried in medical kits of aircraft operated by air carriers; and (2) the training required of flight attendants in the use of such equipment. Requires the Administrator to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to make any revisions to such regulations as a result of such reevaluation. Requires major air carriers to make a good faith effort to report monthly to the Administrator, over the course of a year, regarding deaths on aircrafts. Requires the Administrator to make a decision whether automatic external defibrillators should be required on aircraft and at airports. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring them on helicopters and on aircraft with a maximum payload capacity of 7,500 pounds or less. Declares that an individual shall not be liable for damages in any action brought in Federal or State court arising out of acts or omissions in providing or attempting to provide assistance to a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct."
