(Sec. 101) Sets forth the following mandatory activities for any State receiving such a continuity grant: (1) a public awareness program to provide information on availability and benefits of AT devices and services, with an electronic link to the National Public Internet Site; (2) interagency coordination to improve access to AT devices and services; (3) technical assistance and training to promote access to AT devices and services; and (4) outreach activities that support statewide and community-based organizations to assist individuals with disabilities, especially the elderly and rural populations, use AT devices and services. Sets forth the following discretionary activities that such States may undertake with such continuity grants: (1) alternative State-financed systems that increase access to, and funding for, AT; (2) demonstrations of AT devices; (3) assistance to individuals with disabilities related to securing AT devices and services; (4) a system for public access to information concerning any such discretionary activity; (5) partnerships and cooperative initiatives between public and private sectors to promote greater participation by business and industry in development, demonstration, and dissemination of AT devices and ongoing provision of information about new products to assist individuals with disabilities; and (7) advocacy services. Authorizes States to enter cooperative agreements with other States to expand their capacity to assist individuals with disabilities of all ages to learn about, acquire, use, maintain, adapt, and upgrade AT devices and services. Authorizes States to operate or participate in a computer system through which the State may communicate electronically with other States to gain timely technical assistance and avoid duplication of efforts. Authorizes a State to pay for expenses (including travel expenses) and services (including services of qualified interpreters, readers, and personal care assistants) necessary for access to the comprehensive statewide program of technology-related assistance by individuals with disabilities in financial need who are ineligible for such services through another public agency or private entity. Provides for such payments to States according to a formula based on the number of years or portions of amounts that would have been provided by extension grants under the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act. Provides for payments to additional States under specified conditions. Limits the annual amount of any continuation grant to an outlying area. Sets forth continuation grant requirements for: (1) State designation of a lead agency; (2) State application supplements, including State goals, performance measures, involvement of individuals with disabilities and their families, and continuing obligations; and (3) options relating to funding for FY 1999 through 2004, under which a State may choose whether to receive a continuation grant or a challenge grant, but not both. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to make a six-year grant to an entity in each State to support protection and advocacy services through systems established under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act to assist in acquiring, utilizing, or maintaining AT or AT services for individuals with disabilities. Requires such grants, in the case of certain States, to be made to a designated lead agency or the State Assistive Technology Office. (Sec. 103) Sets forth administrative requirements, for grant programs under this title, for: (1) review of participating entities; (2) corrective action and sanctions; and (3) annual reports of the Secretary to the President and the Congress. Declares that this title may not be construed as authorizing a Federal or a State agency to reduce medical or other assistance available, or to alter eligibility for a benefit or service, under any other Federal law. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary to fund a program to provide AT technical assistance to entities, principally those funded under any grant program under this title. Requires, in designing such program, consideration of input from the directors of comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance and other appropriate individuals, especially: (1) individuals with disabilities who use AT and understand the barriers to the acquisition of AT and AT services; (2) family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives of such individuals; and (3) individuals employed by protection and advocacy systems funded by grants under this title. Directs the Secretary, as part of such technical assistance program, to fund the establishment and maintenance of a National Public Internet Site to provide individuals with disabilities and the general public technical assistance and information on increased access to AT devices and services and to other disability-related resources. Requires that an entity eligible to maintain such Internet site be an institution of higher education that emphasizes research and engineering, has a multidisciplinary research center, and has demonstrated expertise in specified matters. Sets forth required features and minimum library components of such Internet site. Sets forth eligibility, application, and program requirements for entities to receive grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under the technical assistance program. (Sec. 105) Authorizes appropriations for grants and other programs under this title. Title II: National Activities - Subtitle A: Rehabilitation Act of 1973 - Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (RA, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1988) to require increased coordination on disability, AT, and universal design research among Federal departments and agencies that are members of the Interagency Committee on Disability Research and other Federal departments and agencies. Authorizes the Committee to recommend funding for research projects that are jointly undertaken or administered by at least two departments or agencies with representatives on the Committee. (Sec. 202) Directs the National Council on Disability to report to specified congressional committees on the barriers in Federal AT policy to increasing availability of and access to AT devices and services for individuals with disabilities. Requires the Council to obtain input for such report from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, the Association of Tech Act Projects, and targeted individuals. (Sec. 203) Directs the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) to provide training to Federal and State employees concerning their responsibilities under RA to make their electronic and information technology accessible.
