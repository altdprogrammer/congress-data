Prohibits requiring or encouraging any Federal contractor or subcontractor to so discriminate or grant a preference. Declares that this Act does not prohibit or limit encouraging contract bidding, recruiting employees, encouraging participation in other programs or activities or requiring or encouraging Federal contractors, subcontractors, or recipients of Federal licenses or financial assistance to so recruit or encourage, if the recruiting or encouraging does not involve granting a preference. Prohibits construing this Act to prohibit or limit: (1) any act designed to benefit historically Black colleges or universities; or (2) any action under a Federal law or treaty relating to the Indian tribes. Declares that this Act does not prohibit or limit employment classifications based on sex if sex is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to normal operation or the classification is applied regarding an armed forces member. Allows any aggrieved person to obtain, in a civil action, appropriate relief (including back pay). Requires awarding a prevailing plaintiff attorney's fees as part of the costs."
