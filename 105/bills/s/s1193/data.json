Provides that if an indemnity agreement made between the Secretary and a designated agency head is countersigned by the President (or the President's designee), it shall constitute a determination that continuation of the pertinent aircraft operations is necessary to implement U.S. foreign policy. Authorizes binding arbitration of claims for insurance policies issued by the Secretary. Extends the Secretary's authority to provide aviation insurance and reinsurance through December 31, 1998. Treats as a public aircraft any aircraft owned by the U.S. Government and operated by any person for purposes related to crew training, equipment development, or demonstration."
