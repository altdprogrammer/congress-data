Allows for a transfer of property without consideration in the case of an installation located in a rural area whose closure or realignment will have a substantial adverse impact on local communities and on their prospects for economic recovery. Authorizes a transfer of property to the local redevelopment authority (RA) involved, under certain conditions. Requires a determination as to whether another Federal department or agency can use a portion of a closed or realigned installation or will accept transferred property to be made within six months after the date of closure or realignment approval.
