Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to evaluate the potential risks to information stored on personal computers and to take necessary and appropriate actions within its jurisdiction to propose solutions and inform the public. Requires the Secretary of Transportation: (1) to initiate a comprehensive plan to assure that computer hardware and software in transportation systems will not create a safety risk to transportation workers and the general public because of such problem; and (2) if such risk is identified, to take necessary and appropriate measures to assure safety and inform the public."
