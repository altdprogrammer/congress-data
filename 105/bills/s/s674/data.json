Gives States the option to: (1) expand Medicaid eligibility to 150 percent of the poverty line for children over one year of age; and (2) extend coverage to all children under age 19. Prohibits any employer which elects to make employer health insurance contributions on behalf of an employee (or dependent) from conditioning, or varying, such contributions with respect to any such individual by reason of his or her eligibility for Medicaid. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for grants to States, localities, and nonprofit entities to promote outreach efforts to enroll eligible children under Medicaid and related programs."
