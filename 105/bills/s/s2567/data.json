Makes it unlawful for: (1) any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to export goods, technology, or services to such a company; or (2) any person to export to such a company any goods, technology, or services subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Directs the President to require by regulation the closing and divestiture of such companies in the United States or its territories or possessions.
