    "text": "Amends the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 to: (1) extend, upon request of the Government of the Marshall Islands, certain agricultural and food assistance programs for the Bikini and Enewetak people, for another five years; and (2) ensure that the commodities provided reflect the population changes that have occurred since the effective date of the Compact. (Sec. 2) Amends the Organic Act of Guam to provide that an absence of the Governor or Lieutenant Governor from the territory while on official business shall not be a \"temporary absence\" involving a surrender of authority and power. (Sec. 3) Makes technical changes to the Education Amendments of 1972 with respect to Territorial Land Grant Colleges (thus providing separate land grant status to the College of Micronesia-FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, and the Palau Community College). Requires that the land grant trust fund amount attributable to a specified appropriation authorized for Micronesia be divided equally among the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau for the benefit of the College of the Marshall Islands, the College of Micronesia-FSM, and the Palau Community College. (Sec. 4) Provides for transfer of Federal excess real property by the Administrator of General Services to the Government of Guam, with specified exceptions. (Sec. 5) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safety Streets Act of 1968 to extend State treatment with respect to certain drug enforcement programs to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. (Sec. 6) Amends the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to provide that: (1) an absence of the Governor or Lieutenant Governor from the territory while on official business shall not be a \"temporary absence\" involving a surrender of authority and power; and (2) Virgin Islands revenue bonds, instead of the current priority for payment, shall have a parity lien with every other subsequently issued obligation. Authorizes the Virgin Islands legislature to issue short-term (one-year) notes in anticipation of the collection of taxes and revenues for the current fiscal year. (Sec. 7) Establishes the Commission on the Economic Future of the Virgin Islands to make recommendations to the President and the Congress on policies and actions for a secure and self-sustaining future for the local economy of the Virgin Islands through 2020, as well as the Federal role in providing for that future. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the Governor of any U.S. territory or commonwealth or the State of Hawaii to report annually to the Secretary of the Interior with respect to the impact of the compact on them. (Currently the President is required to report on such impacts to the Congress.) Directs the Secretary to provide for a census of Micronesians every five years after each decennial U.S. census for each of the impact areas. (Sec. 9) Amends the Housing Community Development Act of 1980 to make a lawful resident alien of the United States and its territories and possessions (including the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau) eligible for certain housing assistance. (Sec. 10) American Samoa Development Act of 1997 - Establishes the Commission on the Economic Future of American Samoa to make recommendations to the President and the Congress on policies and actions for a secure and self-sustaining future for the local economy of American Samoa through 2020, as well as the Federal role in providing for that future. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 11) Amends Federal law to make subject to appropriations the Secretary of the Interior's mandate to station at least one professional staff person to provide Federal program coordination in each of the Offices of the U.S. Representatives in the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Increases the limit on annual expenditures for projects on Kili or Ejit as part of rehabilitation and resettlement of the Bikini Atoll. Provides for annual adjustments of such amount based on fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index."
