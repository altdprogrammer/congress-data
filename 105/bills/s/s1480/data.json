Requires the Task Force to submit three annual reports to the Congress and the President. Authorizes the President to disestablish the Task Force after submission of its third annual report. Requires the Task Force to submit to the Congress and the President an integrated assessment of hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Directs the President to develop and submit to the Congress a plan based on that assessment for reducing, mitigating, and controlling hypoxia in that area. Mandates publication of a report summary for public comment before submission to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Commerce for research, education, and management related to the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Amends the National Sea Grant College Program Act to allow specified amounts to be used for competitive grants for university research, education, training, and advisory services (currently, for university research) on Pfiesteria piscicida and other harmful algal blooms. Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations for technical assistance to support State implementation and analysis of the effectiveness of measures to prevent, reduce, mitigate, or control harmful algal blooms and hypoxia."
