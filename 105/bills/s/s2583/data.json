Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 104) Provides for a dental officer multiyear retention bonus for the Indian Health Service. (Sec. 105) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to direct the Secretary to make Medicare payments for their direct and indirect operating expenses to approved nonhospital based dentistry residency training programs providing oral health care to children.

(Sec. 106) Amends PHSA to allow the Secretary to designate dental health professional shortage areas. Includes dental hygienists in PHSA's loan repayment program. Title II: Ensuring Delivery of Pediatric Dental Services Under the Medicaid and SCHIP Programs - Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to: (1) provide for quarterly payment to a State of an amount equal to the greater of the Federal medical assistance percentage or 75 per cent of the sums expended during the quarter attributable to dental services for children; (2) require a State Medicaid plan to provide for payment for dental services for children at a rate designed to create an incentive for providers of such services (but that does not result in a reduction or other adverse impact on the extent to which the State provides dental services to adults); (3) set the required minimum Medicaid expenditures each year for dental health services for children; (4) require the State to verify annually sufficient numbers of Medicaid-participating dentists; (5) provide for inclusion of the recommended age for the first dental visit in the definition of early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services; and (6) provide for use of Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funds to treat low-income children with special oral health needs who reside in certain States. (Sec. 207) Amends SSA title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) to direct the Secretary to award grants to States to supplement payments made under State Medicaid and CHIP programs for the treatment of children with special oral health care needs. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 208) Directs the Secretary to establish demonstration projects designed to increase access to dental services for children in underserved areas. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Pediatric Dental Research - Directs the Secretary to: (1) support community based research designed to improve our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of pediatric oral, dental, craniofacial diseases and conditions and their sequelae in high risk populations; and (2) develop clinical approaches for pediatric dental disease risk assessment. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 302) Amends PHSA to direct the Administrator for Health Care Policy and Research to conduct and support activities with respect to existing barriers to dental care for children and establishment of measures of oral health quality, including access to oral health care for children. (Sec. 303) Directs the Secretary to convene a Consensus Development Conference to: (1) examine the management of early childhood caries; and (2) support research on the biology and physiologic dynamics of infectious transmission of dental caries. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Surveillance and Accountability - Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect and report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on the dental, craniofacial, and oral health of residents of at least one State from each HHS region. (Sec. 402) Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to require a State Medicaid plan to provide for reporting to the Secretary: (1) the percentage of expenditures for early and periodic dental screening, diagnostic, and treatment services; and (2) the percentage of general and pediatric dentists licensed in the State and providing services commensurate with State plan eligibility. (Sec. 403) Directs the Administrator of the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees the percentage of children enrolled in a Head Start or Early Start program who have access to and who obtain dental care, including children with special oral, dental, and craniofacial health needs.
