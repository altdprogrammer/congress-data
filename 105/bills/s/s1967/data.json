    "text": "Transit in Parks (TRIP) Act - Amends Federal mass transportation law to declare that it is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems for the betterment of the national parks and other units of the National Park System, national wildlife refuges, recreational areas, and other public lands in order to conserve natural, historical, and cultural resources, prevent adverse impact and reduce pollution, and enhance visitor mobility and accessibility. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a cooperative relationship with the Secretary of the Interior for: (1) the exchange of technical assistance; (2) creation of interagency and multidisciplinary teams to develop Federal land management agency transportation policy; and (3) the development of procedures and criteria for planning, selecting, and funding qualified mass transportation projects. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to contract for or enter into grants, cooperative agreements, or other agreements with qualified participants to carry out qualified mass transportation projects (including mass transportation projects that are of regional or national significance) in national parks and related public lands. Sets forth: (1) limits for planning, research, and technical assistance for such projects (including the Federal share of costs); and (2) specified project criteria. Makes mass transportation projects under this Act eligible for funding through a State Infrastructure Bank or other innovative financing mechanism. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake, or make grants or contracts (including agreements with Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities) or other agreements for research, development, and deployment of new technologies that will conserve resources and prevent adverse environmental impact, improve visitor mobility and accessibility, and reduce pollution (including noise and visual pollution) in the national parks and related public lands. Directs the Secretary to study and report to specified congressional committees on alternative needs in national parks and related public lands that are managed by Federal land management agencies. Authorizes appropriations."
