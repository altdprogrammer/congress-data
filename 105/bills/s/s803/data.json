    "text": "United States Cruise Tourism Act of 1997 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to approve the transportation of passengers on foreign-flag cruise vessels not otherwise qualified to engage in the coastwise trade between ports in the United States, directly or by way of a foreign port, except with respect to coastwise trade served by a U.S.-flag cruise vessel. Requires termination of any such foreign-flag cruise vessel passenger service within three years after a U.S.-flag cruise vessel commences such service between the same ports. Requires the owner or charterer of a qualified foreign-flag cruise vessel to have any vessel repairs performed in the United States, unless the vessel requires repairs or service while at a distant foreign port. Directs the Secretary to terminate the coastwise trade privileges of the owner or charterer of a foreign-flag cruise vessel if such repairs have not been made in the United States. Provides a waiver of such requirements in emergencies. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize an immigration officer to extend for a period or periods of up to six months each a conditional permit to land temporarily in the United States granted to an alien crewman employed on a vessel, if the vessel owner or charterer requests the extension and the immigration officer determines that it is necessary to maintain the vessel in the coastwise trade between ports in the United States, directly or by way of a foreign port."
