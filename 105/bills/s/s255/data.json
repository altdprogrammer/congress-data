    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-02-04", 
    "text": "Law Enforcement and Public Safety Telecommunications Empowerment Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from issuing new broadcast station licenses in the spectrum between 746 and 806 megahertz after the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the FCC to allocate and assign 24 megahertz of such spectrum for law enforcement and public safety uses, and 36 megahertz for commercial uses. Directs the FCC to transfer the right to assign such allocated spectrum to the Public Safety Telecommunications Institute (established later under this Act). Establishes in the Treasury an account for proceeds received from the auction of such spectrum to commercial users. Authorizes the Institute to retain ten percent of such proceeds (with minimum and maximum limits) for use in funding State and local law enforcement and public safety agencies' mission-related radio communications capabilities. Requires proportionate distribution of account funds among States. Repeals a provision of the Act which terminates on September 30, 1998, FCC authority to grant broadcasting licenses or permits. Establishes the Public Safety Telecommunications Institute to: (1) auction and assign spectrum in accordance with the Act; (2) award grants and contracts; and (3) certify programs intended to aid and improve State law enforcement and public safety telecommunications systems."
