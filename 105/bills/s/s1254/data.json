    "text": "Federal Lands Management Adjustment Act - Provides that whenever a State applies for a transfer of authority to manage Federal lands located in such State and the Congress enacts legislation authorizing and directing such transfer, the Secretary with jurisdiction over such lands (Secretary of the Interior with respect to Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands or Secretary of Agriculture with respect to National Forest System (NFS) lands) shall transfer management responsibilities to such State for the appropriate period. Outlines procedures for: (1) State applications for such management authority; (2) the granting of such authority; and (3) subsequent State management of such lands (including the continuation of all existing leases, permits, mineral rights, and other authorizations, and the collection of fees, rents, and other revenues). (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations to a State assuming such authority for three fiscal years following enactment of the legislation authorizing such transfer. (Sec. 10) Provides a ten-year term of State authority to manage eligible Federal lands, allowing such State to apply for an additional ten-year period or to apply for ownership of such lands. Provides for resumption of Federal authority over such lands if the term expires and no additional application is approved. (Sec. 12) Authorizes any nonprofit organization organized under the laws of a State in which the Federal lands are located to apply for authority to manage Federal lands comprising: (1) not less than all Federal lands within any BLM district or NFS unit in such State; and (2) not more than three BLM districts or NFS units, or a combination thereof, in the same general area. Outlines application requirements and procedures for granting management authority (including enactment of legislation authorizing such transfer) to such organizations. Authorizes appropriations to an organization assuming such authority for three fiscal years following enactment of the authorizing legislation. Provides an identical ten-year term of management authority for such organizations, with a right to apply for an additional ten-year period. Provides for resumption of Federal authority over such lands if such term expires and no additional application is approved. (Sec. 13) Provides venue in the appropriate State court for any action for which a State has assumed land management authority over Federal lands."
