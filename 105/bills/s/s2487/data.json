Requires such equal access for public intermediate and secondary noncurriculum-related school groups, or students pursuing noncurriculum-related activities, to: (1) expense reimbursement; and (2) opportunity to distribute materials. Requires such equal access for community groups to meeting space or other use of facilities at public elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools with a limited community forum. Extends current equal access guarantees for public secondary noncurriculum-related school groups and students pursuing noncurriculum-related activities during non-instructional time, to such groups and students in public intermediate schools, with respect to access to meeting space or other use of school facilities in such a limited open forum."
