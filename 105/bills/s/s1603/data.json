    "text": "Survivors of Torture Support Act - Declares that it shall be U.S. policy not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States. Requires the heads of the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations which shall exclude specified aliens who travel from territory contiguous to the United States. Denies any court jurisdiction to review such regulations. Specifies that nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the Attorney General's authority to detain any person under any provision of law. (Sec. 5) Covers within this Act any alien presenting a claim of having been tortured, or whom there is reason to believe has been tortured. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) consideration by appropriate officials of the effects of torture; (2) expedited processing of refugee admissions and for asylum and withholding of removal; (3) granting parole in lieu of detention for such an individual under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and (4) exemption of such an individual from expedited removal pursuant to such Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should allocate sufficient resources to maintain in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Resource Information Center current information relating to the use of torture in foreign countries. (Sec. 6) Directs the Attorney General to provide training for immigration inspectors and examiners, immigration officers, asylum officers, immigration judges, and other relevant Department of Justice officials, and directs the Secretary of State to provide training for consular officers, regarding the identification of torture, the surrounding circumstances most often practiced, the long-term effects upon a victim, the identification of the physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of torture, and the appropriate manner of interviewing torture victims. (Sec. 7) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to programs in the United States to cover the cost of specified services for torture victims. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for assistance for domestic centers and programs for the treatment of torture victims. (Sec. 8) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide grants to treatment centers and programs in foreign countries which are specifically carrying out projects or activities to treat victims of torture. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture for FY 1999 through 2001."
