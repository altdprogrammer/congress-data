    "text": "Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1997 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require a group health plan, and an insurer offering group coverage, to include coverage for bone mass measurement for individuals who: (1) are estrogen-deficient women at clinical risk for osteoporosis; (2) have vertebral abnormalities; (3) are receiving chemotherapy or long-term gluococorticoid (steroid) therapy; (4) have primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or excess thyroid replacement; or (5) are being monitored to assess the response to or efficacy of approved osteoporosis drug therapy. Regulates frequency and cost sharing. Prohibits related denial of coverage, incentives to individuals, restrictions on provider-patient communications, and provider penalties. Allows State laws providing greater detection or prevention benefits. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply the above requirements to coverage offered in the individual market. (Sec. 3) Requires five specified Institutes of the National Institutes of Health to expand and intensify osteoporosis and related bone disease research. Mandates (subject to available appropriations) grants or contracts for the development and operation of at least three centers to conduct such research. Authorizes appropriations for each of the Institutes and the research centers. (Sec. 4) Authorizes appropriations (in addition to other authorizations) for the establishment and operation of a clearinghouse on osteoporosis and related bone disorders."
