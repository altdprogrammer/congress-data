Title II: Financial Assistance - Subtitle A: Microloan Program - Amends provisions of the Act relating to the Microloan Program to: (1) increase to $3.5 million the total amount authorized to be outstanding and committed to any one intermediary under the Program; (2) revise loan loss reserve levels required of intermediaries during various years of participation; (3) extend through FY 2000 the Program authorization; and (4) allow a Microloan intermediary to expend up to 25 percent of grant funds to enter into third party contracts for the provision of technical assistance. (Sec. 202) Establishes under the Program a welfare-to-work microloan initiative to test the feasibility of supplementing the technical assistance provided to individuals receiving assistance under the State program funded under part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) of title IV of the Social Security Act, or any other comparable State-funded program, in order to assist such individuals in establishing small businesses and eliminating their dependence on such assistance. Allows such assistance to be used to provide management, marketing, and technical assistance, or to pay child care and transportation costs of microborrowers (to the extent that such costs are not paid by State block grants or under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act). Authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to select from participating Microloan intermediaries entities to receive supplemental grants under the welfare-to-work program. Allows borrowers under any Microloan program to use loan proceeds to establish child care centers or to provide transportation services. Directs the SBA to report annually to the small business committees on such initiative. Allows only funds transferred from another Federal department or agency to be used for the initiative. Limits the amount of funds that may be used under the initiative for each of FY 1998 through 2000. Subtitle B: Small Business Investment Company Program - Amends provisions of the Act and the SBIA relating to the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program to: (1) allow amounts obligated under the SBIC to be committed for five fiscal years (currently obligated in one fiscal year and committed in the next); (2) provide leverage eligibility requirements for SBIC applicants located in a State that is not currently served by an SBIC (underserved area); (3) exclude as private capital, for SBIC purposes, funds obtained from the business revenues of any federally chartered or government-sponsored corporation established prior to October 1, 1987; (4) authorize the SBA to prescribe fees for participation as an SBIC; (5) allow national, Federal Reserve, or nonmember insured banks to invest in SBICs or in entities established to invest solely in SBICs, with an investment limit; (6) allow the maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to a participating SBIC to be increased annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index; (7) limit to $90 million (with exceptions) the total amount of leverage issued to any one company; (8) require each leverage applicant to make certain certifications with respect to the amount of financings to be provided solely to smaller enterprises; (9) allow a participating company to make quarterly (currently, annual) payments to its shareholders based on estimates of maximum tax liability; (10) revise a leverage fee payment schedule; (11) direct the SBA to issue guarantees and trust certificates (representing debentures issued by SBICs) at least every six (currently, three) months; and (12) provide for the deposit and use of SBIC examination fees. Subtitle C: Certified Development Company Program - Amends the SBIA with respect to the certified development company (CDC) program to: (1) authorize the use of seller-provided financing in connection with SBA loans for plant acquisition, construction, conversion, and expansion; (2) increase the loan fee under the CDC program; and (3) require such fee to be established annually by the SBA in the minimum amount necessary to reduce to zero the cost to the SBA of purchasing and guaranteeing debentures under the program. Amends the SBIA with respect to the premier certified lenders program to: (1) repeal a provision limiting to 15 the number of CDCs authorized to participate; and (2) revise eligibility conditions and loss reserve requirements for participating CDCs (requiring replenishment of loss reserves paid to the SBA by CDCs). Requires participating companies to establish a goal of processing a minimum of at least 50 percent of their total loan applications pursuant to the program. Amends the Small Business Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1994 to extend through FY 2000 the premier certified lenders program. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes the Administrator to verify a general business loan applicant's criminal background through the best means available. (Sec. 232) Directs the Administrator to: (1) report on actions taken and planned for future reliance on private sector lending resources to originate, approve, close, service, liquidate, foreclose, and litigate SBA general business loans; and (2) perform and complete the planning needed to serve as the basis for funding the development and implementation of a computerized SBA loan monitoring system (LMS). Requires the Administrator to report to the small business committees and the Comptroller General (CG) with respect to the LMS. Requires the CG to submit an evaluation of such report to the small business committees, prohibiting the obligation of any LMS funding until 45 days after such report is received. Title III: Women's Business Enterprises - Amends the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 to: (1) require the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Women's Business Ownership to serve as the Interagency Committee Liaison to the National Women's Business Council; (2) require a report from the Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise to be transmitted to the President through the SBA, and to include a status report on Committee progress in meeting its responsibilities and duties; (3) require the National Women's Business Council to submit to the President and the small business committees an annual activities report; (4) extend the deadline for presidential appointment of a chairperson for the Council; (5) increase from nine to 14 the number of Council members (and provide Council member terms); and (6) increase, and extend through FY 2000, the authorization of appropriations under such Act. (Sec. 306) Directs the Council to study and report to the President and the small business committees on the award of Federal prime contracts and subcontracts to women-owned businesses. Requires a related best-practices report. (Sec. 307) Authorizes the Council to conduct studies and other research relating to the award of Federal prime contracts and subcontracts to women-owned businesses, as well as access to credit and investment capital by women entrepreneurs. (Sec. 308) Authorizes the SBA to provide financial assistance to private organizations to conduct five-year projects for the benefit of small businesses owned and controlled by women. Outlines participation conditions and Federal and non-Federal contribution requirements. Directs each applicant to submit to the SBA a five-year plan on proposed fund raising and training activities. Directs the SBA to evaluate and rank applicants based on predetermined selection criteria stated in terms of relative importance. Establishes the position of Assistant Administrator for the Office of Women's Business Ownership with specified duties in the administration of Office programs and services for women entrepreneurs. Directs the Administrator to: (1) develop an annual programmatic and financial examination of each women's business center; and (2) report annually to the small business committees on projects conducted. Authorizes appropriations. Allows: (1) authorized amounts to be used only for grant awards and not for program management and administration; and (2) for the use of expedited acquisition methods to carry out this section. Title IV: Competitiveness Program and Procurement Opportunities - Subtitle A: Small Business Competitiveness Program - Amends the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988 to: (1) extend permanently the small business competitiveness demonstration program; (2) require participating agencies to monitor the attainment of their small business participation goals on an annual (currently, quarterly) basis; (3) extend through FY 2000 required annual reports to the Congress concerning such program; and (4) extend permanently small business participation in contracting opportunities for dredging. Subtitle B: Small Business Procurement Opportunities Program - Amends the Act to require each Federal agency to: (1) foster the participation of small businesses as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers; (2) structure its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small businesses; and (3) avoid the unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contracts that precludes small business participation as prime contractors. Defines \"contract bundling\" as consolidating two or more procurement requirements into a single contract solicitation unlikely for award to a small business due to the diversity, size or specialized nature of performance elements, the aggregate dollar value of the anticipated award, geographical dispersion of contract performance sites, or a combination of such factors. (Sec. 413) Requires procurement strategies used by Federal contracting agencies to facilitate the maximum participation of small businesses as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. Requires the head of an agency to conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified, taking into account specified factors. Requires a strategy calling for contract bundling to identify benefits of such bundling as well as impediments caused to small businesses by such bundling. Allows a small business, in the case of contract bundling, to submit an offer that provides for the use of a team of subcontractors to perform the contract. Requires the SBA to determine whether a contract solicitation involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements. Requires the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization of each Federal contracting agency to identify proposed solicitations that involve significant contract bundling and to increase participation by small businesses in such solicitations as either prime contractors or subcontractors and suppliers.
