    "text": "Debit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to cite conditions limiting consumer liability for unauthorized debit card transactions executed through an electronic fund transfer. Reduces from ten business days to five business days the deadline within which a financial institution: (1) must report to a consumer the results of its investigation concerning allegations of error in such consumer's account; and (2) may conditionally recredit a consumer's account for the amount of the alleged error upon receipt of appropriate notification. Declares that a non-protected access card may only be issued upon consumer request or application, or as a renewal of or substitution for, a non-protected access card. Requires a financial institution to furnish to the consumer: (1) a printed warning that a card does not require a personalized code or other unique identifier (other than a signature) to initiate access to the consumer's account; (2) an annual summary of error resolution procedures; and (3) its policy regarding restitution of any fees imposed as a result of an unauthorized electronic fund transfer."
