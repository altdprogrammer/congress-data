(Sec. 10) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat block grants and guarantees provided under the HOME Investment Partnerships Act or NAHASDA not as Federal subsidies, under specified circumstances, for the purposes of determining eligibility for the low-income housing credit. (Sec. 11) Amends NAHASDA to repeal the requirement regarding the certification of compliance with subsidy layering requirements with respect to housing assisted with grant amounts provided under the Act."
