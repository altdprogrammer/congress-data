Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands and interests within the boundaries of the historic site by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange or transfer from another Federal agency. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring any lands contaminated with hazardous substances, unless all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment has been taken. Requires the Secretary to: (1) prepare a general management plan for the historic site, including an evaluation of a location for a visitor facility and administrative site; and (2) in developing the plan, to consider coordinating and consolidating administrative, management, and personnel function with Badlands National Park. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary of the Air Force to transfer to the Secretary any funds specifically appropriated to the Air Force for the maintenance, protection, or preservation of the facilities."
