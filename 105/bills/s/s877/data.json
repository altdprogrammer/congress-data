    "text": "NOAA Corps Disestablishment Act - Converts to civilian service each conversion-eligible officer in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps of Commissioned Officers who has signed a conversion agreement and the position to which the officer is assigned. Provides for a conversion benefit, Thrift Savings Plan eligibility, and credit for unused leave. Authorizes appropriations to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund equal to the Federal Employee Retirement System supplemental liability created by granting service credit. (Sec. 6) Mandates establishment of additional NOAA civilian positions. (Sec. 7) Disestablishes the Corps as of October 1, 1997. Provides for noncompetitive appointment eligibility in the Department of Commerce. (Sec. 8) Separates conversion-eligible officers who do not sign a conversion agreement, with eligibility for separation pay. Amends the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned Officers Act of 1948 to remove dollar caps on separation pay. Provides for retirement eligibility and terms. (Sec. 9) Deems Corps service to have been active service in the Navy. Provides for the administration of retired pay, survivor, and other benefits. Makes related amendments to Federal law provisions relating to the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund. (Sec. 10) Mandates a final determination, based on a physical examination, regarding each officer on the temporarily disabled retired list. (Sec. 11) Repeals: (1) the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned Officers Act of 1948 and numerous other Federal Acts and provisions related to the Corps; and (2) provisions authorizing extra compensation to members of vessel crews when assigned duties as instrument observer or recorder and to other Federal agencies' employees while observing tides or currents or tending seismographs or magnetographs. (Sec. 12) Authorizes the establishment, elimination, or reorganization of any office in NOAA as necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Act. Mandates a report to the Congress describing any such actions."
