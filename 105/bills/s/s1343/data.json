Title II: PHAER Trust Fund - Establishes in the U.S. Treasury the PHAER Trust Fund into which shall be deposited amounts equivalent to the revenue increase in the Treasury attributable to the increased excise taxes of this Act. Requires 75 percent of the amounts in the Fund to be distributed, as specified, for the following State programs: (1) tobacco education, prevention, cessation, and treatment; (2) the Children's Health Insurance Program; (3) the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant program, or both; (4) the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer prevention; and (5) general health care block grants. Requires the remaining 25 percent to be distributed, as specified, for the following Federal programs: (1) tobacco control and prevention; (2) protecting the financial well-being of tobacco farming families and communities; (3) the National Institutes of Health; (4) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Title III: Federal Standards with Respect to Tobacco Products - Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 to repeal provisions which limit health-related statements on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products and advertisements. Title IV: Sense of the Senate - Expresses the sense of the Senate that any final comprehensive tobacco legislation funded by the PHAER Trust Fund must include, among other things: (1) stiff penalties for advertising that targets children; (2) authority for the Food and Drug Administration to treat tobacco like any other drug; (3) elimination of secondhand tobacco smoke; (4) ingredient disclosure and more prominent health warnings on all tobacco products; and (5) a prohibition on the use of Federal Government resources to weaken nondiscriminatory public health laws or promote tobacco sales abroad."
