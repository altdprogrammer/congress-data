    "text": "Federal Research Financing Improvement Act of 1997 - Prohibits the construction of new Federal research facilities to carry out a covered research activity unless the head of the Federal agency with jurisdiction over the new facility enters into a cooperative agreement for such construction and the conduct of such research with appropriate representatives of each beneficiary industry to be served by the activity. Requires the beneficiary industries to pay at least half the cost of construction (individual percentages to be determined according to a formula developed by the appropriate Federal agency head). Requires the agreement to provide for both: (1) sharing among beneficiary industries of intellectual property obtained from covered research activities; and (2) protection of certain intellectual property used by the Federal Government in carrying out the activities."
