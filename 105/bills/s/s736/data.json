Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide a written identification of all mineral and grazing leases in effect on such lands; and (2) notify all such leaseholders of the conveyance made by this Act. Requires receipts from leases, licenses, and permits accruing after the conveyance date to be used for Project purposes and for financing the portion of operations, maintenance, and replacement of the Summer Dam which, prior to conveyance, was the responsibility of the Bureau of Reclamation, with the exception of major maintenance programs in progress prior to the conveyance. Requires receipts paid into the reclamation fund as construction credits to the Project to be credited to deficit reduction or retirement of the Federal debt."
