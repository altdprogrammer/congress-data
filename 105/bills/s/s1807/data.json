Includes transferred lands within the Refuge. Requires the BLM to retain jurisdiction over certain lands located south of the Refuge identified for cooperative management. Requires such lands that are within the Guano Creek Wilderness Study Area to be managed so as not to impair the suitability of the Area for designation as wilderness. Transfers administrative jurisdiction over other specified lands adjacent to or within the Refuge from the Fish and Wildlife Service to the BLM. Removes such lands from the Refuge, modifies the Refuge's boundary to reflect that removal, and designates the lands as public lands."
