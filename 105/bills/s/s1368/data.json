Provides for segregation of files on request, authorization revocation, and records of authorizations and revocations. Subtitle B: Limited Circumstances Providing for Disclosure Without Authorization - Allows any person to disclose protected health information: (1) in order to allay or remedy a threat of imminent physical or mental harm to an information subject; and (2) if there is an identifiable threat of serious injury or death to an identifiable individual or group and other requirements are met.

(Sec. 224) Sets forth a sequence regulating who may exercise an individual's rights under this Act when the individual cannot knowingly or effectively do so, designating first a person named in a health care power of attorney, then an individual authorized by law or by an instrument recognized under law to act as the individual's representative, then next of kin, and last the health care provider, in each case moving to the next level if the person cannot be contacted after a reasonable effort. Applies this Act to deceased persons for two years after death and provides for the exercise of rights on behalf of a deceased individual.
