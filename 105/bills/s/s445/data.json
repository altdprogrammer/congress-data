    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-03-14", 
    "text": "Waste Tire Recycling, Abatement, and Disposal Act of 1997 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit, with exceptions, the following: (1) disposal of a waste tire (other than shredded tire material) on land or in a landfill; (2) receipt of any waste tire at any collection site unless, within seven days after receipt, it is processed, converted to shredded tire material, or transferred to a tire retreading business; (3) operation of a collection site except in compliance with stated standards (and others required by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule) concerning such matters as size, location, accessibility, enclosure, and emergency planning; (4) storage of more than 1,500 waste tires, other than as shredded tire material, for more than seven days at a collection site; (5) engaging in certain waste tire transfer, disposal, or delivery activities except in compliance with a permit issued pursuant to a State waste tire recycling, abatement, and disposal program (State program) approved under this Act or by the EPA Administrator; and (6) operation of a shredded tire facility containing more than a specified amount of material. Requires tire haulers, collectors, and processors to file with the Administrator or the designated State agency, within one year of enactment of this Act, reports containing specified information on waste tire presence, delivery, and site operation. Provides procedures for application for approval to implement a State program. Directs the Administrator to establish minimum elements of a program that include permit, fee, and revenue use requirements. Requires a report to the Congress based on State application information. Authorizes grants to States from the Waste Tire Recycling, Abatement, and Disposal Trust Fund and other assistance on a cost recovery basis. Requires the Administrator to establish, administer, and enforce a program for a State if it has not submitted a program for approval or is not adequately administering and enforcing a program. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) order an owner or operator of a collection site or a transferor of waste tires to a site to abate the site and to undertake abatement action using the Trust Fund; and (2) bring an action to restrain the operation of, or deposit of tires at, the site or take other action to protect human health and the environment, including issuing orders as necessary if this action is insufficient. Imposes penalties for violations of orders and liability for costs incurred in an abatement action undertaken by the Administrator. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, and the head of each Federal agency that owns land on which a tire collection site is located to prepare a plan to abate, not later than December 31, 2002, waste tire dumps and stockpiles located on public lands. Authorizes appropriations from the Trust Fund. Makes Trust Fund amounts available for: (1) grants to develop and implement State programs (giving highest priority to ensuring adequate capacity for tire shredding operations); (2) abatement on public lands; (3) cost offsets associated with Federal procurement of asphalt paving material containing recycled rubber; (4) Federal abatement program implementation or Federal abatement actions; and (5) waste tire processing research and development. Directs the Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation, to conduct a program of research regarding such asphalt material. Sets forth procedures for issuance of compliance orders and imposition of civil and criminal penalties. Requires the Administrator to prepare final guidelines, not later than December 31, 1999, for rubber products containing crumb rubber derived from waste tire processing."
