Authorizes the FCC, with respect to an area served by a rural telephone company, and requires the FCC, in the case of all other areas, to designate more than one common carrier as an eligible carrier for such a designated service area, provided each additional requesting carrier meets eligibility requirements. Requires the FCC, before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, to find that such designation is in the public interest."
