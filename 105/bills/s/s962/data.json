    "text": "Gaming Clarification Act of 1997 - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to state that article III of the Constitution of Missouri which authorizes the State legislature to permit games of chance only upon the Missouri River or the Mississippi River, conducted on excursion gambling boats and floating facilities: (1) is a prohibitory measure; and (2) may not be construed to permit land-based class III gaming. (Sec. 3) Applies current restrictions on lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior in trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe to any lands acquired by the Secretary in trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe when at the time of the taking of those lands into trust, those lands are located outside of the State in which the tribe is located. (Sec. 4) Prohibits lands taken into trust for an Indian tribe after enactment of this Act from being considered Indian lands upon which class II or class III gaming may be conducted, except when: (1) the Indian tribe submits an application to the Secretary containing an explicit declaration of the intent of the Indian tribe to conduct gaming on those lands; and (2) the Secretary approves the declaration contained in the petition."
