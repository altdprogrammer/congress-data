Requires such matter to conform with specified regulations issued by the Postmaster General before it may be carried or delivered by mail. Subjects matter violating such regulations to current cease and desist and other postal law sanctions involving false representations and lotteries. Requires any otherwise legally acceptable matter not in conformance with such regulations to be disposed of as the Postal Service directs. Authorizes the use of administrative subpoenas by the Postmaster General in any investigation involving nonmailable matter."
