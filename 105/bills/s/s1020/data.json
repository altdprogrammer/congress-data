Gives priority to projects, productions, and workshops that increase public access to the arts, especially for underserved communities (including access by touring, by regional or national dissemination, or by geographic dispersion). Provides for a program of NEA direct grants to groups and individuals that are broadly representative of the U.S. cultural heritage and broadly geographically representative, for projects, productions, and workshops of high artistic excellence and merit (with a 50 percent Federal match, and certain discretionary increases of such match).

Requires recipients of funding to repay certain amounts if they have derived net program income from the funded activities exceeding a specified amount. Continues provisions for the National Medal of Arts.
