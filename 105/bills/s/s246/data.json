(Sec. 101) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make monthly advance payments to such a plan with respect to an individual enrollee of either a monthly choice care value amount (determined according to a specified formula) or of a monthly premium, whichever is less. Requires the Secretary to pay each eligible individual 75 percent of any excess over the plan premium of the weighted average of the choice care value amounts with respect to all individuals in a reimbursement area (rebate amounts), with the remainder of the excess amount deposited in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance). Bans choice care plans from providing any services related to assisted suicide. Title II: Medicare Medical Savings Accounts - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide under the Medicare Choice Care program for Medicare medical savings accounts (MSAs) for deposit of (income-excludible) rebate amounts, contributions by the account holder, and by the Secretary and others on behalf of the account holder, as well as deposit of certain rollover contributions, to cover the account holder's qualified medical expenses for medical care, with special rules for account distributions and reports."
