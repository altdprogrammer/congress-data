Directs the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make block grants to carry out affordable housing activities for Native Hawaiian families on or near Hawaiian Home Lands. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands only if the Director of the Department has submitted a housing plan that meets requirements under this Act. Sets forth plan terms, conditions, and requirements. Provides for plan review by the Secretary. Sets forth provisions regarding the treatment of program income, project labor standards, and environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Limits assistance for affordable housing activities under the program to low-income Native Hawaiian families, with specified exceptions for: (1) certain homeownership activities; and (2) assistance to non-Native Hawaiians if the presence of the family in the housing involved is essential to the well-being of Native Hawaiian families and the housing need cannot be met without assistance. Describes eligible affordable housing activities. Sets forth program requirements, including the development of policies governing rents, homebuyer payments, eligibility, management, leases, and tenant selection. Sets the maximum monthly rent or homebuyer payment at 30 percent of the monthly adjusted family income. Reduces future grant payments and requires repayment if housing does not remain affordable for the longest feasible time determined by the Secretary. Sets forth additional remedies for noncompliance with program requirements, including termination of grants and civil actions against the Department. Provides for monitoring by the Director to assess compliance with this Act and progress reports to the Secretary. Sets forth additional review, auditing, and reporting requirements for the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 4) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to authorize the Secretary to guarantee up to $100 million in loans from approved lenders in each of FY 1999 through 2003 to provide access to sources of private financing to Native Hawaiian families who could otherwise not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of the Hawaiian Home Lands or as a result of a lack of access to private financial markets. Provides that a loan will be used to construct, acquire, or rehabilitate not more than four-family dwellings that are standard housing and located on Hawaiian Home Lands for which an approved housing plan to provide affordable home ownership housing applies. Limits loans to 30-year terms. Permits the Secretary to guarantee a loan only upon determining that there is a reasonable prospect of repayment. Sets forth remedies for the Secretary if lenders fail to meet certain requirements, including the imposition of monetary penalties. Establishes a Hawaiian Housing Guarantee Fund for the purpose of providing loan guarantees under this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to establish safety and quality standards for housing financed under these provisions."
