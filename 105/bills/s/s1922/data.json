Amends Federal law concerning Government organization and employees to designate the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in each even numbered year, Election day, as a legal public holiday, with such holiday to be known as Freedom and Democracy Day. States that Freedom and Democracy Day shall: (1) be a regular workday; (2) not be treated as a legal public holiday for purposes of statutes relating to pay and leave of Federal employees; and (3) not affect the regular operations of the Federal Government."
