    "text": "Oregon Inlet Protection Act of 1997 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army to jointly designate the tracts of land for the jetty and sand transfer system for the Oregon Inlet on the coast of North Carolina. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer administrative jurisdiction over the tracts to the Secretary of the Army. Orders the Secretary of the Army, if such joint designation does not occur within 60 days, to designate the tracts and to notify the Secretary of the Interior of the designation. Limits the amount of acreage included in the tracts to 65 acres in the Cape Hatteras National Seashore Recreational Area and 35 acres in the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge, unless the joint designation occurs. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, after providing the Secretary of the Interior 60 days notice, to designate an additional adjacent tract of land if the Secretary finds that any designated tract is inadequate for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a jetty and sand transfer system."
