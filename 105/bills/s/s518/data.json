    "text": "Victim Restitution Enforcement Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal criminal code to revise procedures for the issuance and enforcement of restitution orders. Directs the court to: (1) order the probation service of the court to obtain and include in its presentence report, or in a separate report, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order (which shall include a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant); and (2) disclose to the defendant and the attorney for the Government all portions of the report pertaining to such matters. Makes specified provisions of the Federal criminal code and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the only laws and rules applicable to proceedings for the issuance and enforcement of restitution orders. Authorizes the court, upon application of the United States, to enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of property or assets necessary to satisfy a criminal restitution order, if specified circumstances apply. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) notice requirements; (2) evidence and information that the court may consider at a hearing; (3) the use of temporary restraining orders; (4) disclosure of financial information regarding the defendant; (5) the use of consumer credit reports; and (6) timetables for the attorney for the Government to provide the probation service of the court with information available to the attorney, including matters occurring before the grand jury relating to the identity of the victims, the amount of losses, and financial matters relating to the defendant. Directs the attorney for the Government to provide notice to all victims as soon as practicable. Authorizes: (1) the court to limit the information to be provided or sought by the probation service under specified circumstances; (2) a victim who objects to any information provided to the probation service by the attorney for the Government to file a separate affidavit with the court; and (3) the court to require additional documentation or hear testimony after reviewing the report of the probation service. Provides for the privacy of records filed and testimony heard and permits records to be filed or testimony to be heard in camera. Establishes procedures regarding the court's ascertaining of the victims' losses. Permits the court to refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed restitution order to a magistrate or special master for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the court. Prohibits consideration of compensation for losses from insurance or other sources. Requires that the court resolve any restitution dispute by the preponderance of evidence. Directs the court to order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court without consideration of the defendant's economic circumstances. Sets forth provisions regarding situations where the amount of the loss is not reasonably ascertainable, and where there is more than one defendant. Specifies that no victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order. Requires the defendant to notify the court and the Attorney General of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution. Authorizes the court to adjust the payment schedule. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) court retention of jurisdiction over criminal restitution judgments; and (2) enforcement of restitution orders. Specifies that: (1) a conviction of a defendant for an offense giving rise to restitution shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, regardless of any State law precluding estoppel for a lack of mutuality; and (2) the victim, in the subsequent proceeding, shall not be precluded from establishing a loss that is greater than that determined by the court in the earlier criminal proceeding. (Sec. 3) Adds restitution to a provision governing the post-sentence administration of fines. Provides that an order of restitution shall operate as a lien in favor of the United States for its benefit or for the benefit of any non-Federal victims against all property belonging to the defendant. Authorizes the court, in enforcing a restitution order, to order jointly owned property divided and sold, subject to specified requirements. (Sec. 4) Specifies that a defendant shall not incur any criminal penalty for failure to make a payment on a fine, special assessment, restitution, or cost because of the defendant's indigency. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the court, where a defendant knowingly fails to pay a delinquent fine, to increase the defendant's sentence to any sentence that might originally have been imposed under the applicable statute."
