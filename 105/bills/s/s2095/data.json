(Sec. 3) Increases the Foundation's Board of Directors from 15 to 25 members, including the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Foundation to have its principal offices in Washington, D.C. (as currently provided), or in the bordering counties of Maryland and Virginia. Sets forth conditions for the Foundation to: (1) acquire and convey property, including agency approval; and (2) invest and deposit Federal funds. Revises provisions relating to agency approval of acquisitions of property and of conveyances and grants. Sets forth limitations relating to the Foundation's: (1) reconveyance of real property; and (2) expenditures for printing services or capital equipment. Repeals an exemption from State or local government condemnation for Foundation lands, water, and interests valuable for fish and wildlife conservation or management. Amends the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 to repeal specified grant and audit provisions with respect to the Foundation. (Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations through FY 2003 for the Departments of Commerce and the Interior to carry out activities under the Act. Authorizes the Foundation to accept funds from a Federal agency under any other Federal law to further its conservation activities. Sets forth matching fund requirements. Prohibits Foundation grants from being used for litigation expenses or for lobbying the Congress. (Sec. 6) Declares that nothing in the Act authorizes the Foundation to perform any function for which authority is provided to the National Park Foundation by specified Federal law."
