Sets forth provisions regarding maximum grant awards, allocation of such awards, and grant renewal. Authorizes the use of grant amounts to comprehensively address truancy through: (1) parental involvement in prevention activities; (2) sanctions; (3) parental accountability; (4) in-school truancy prevention programs; (5) involvement of local law enforcement, social services, judicial, business, and religious communities, and nonprofit organizations; (6) technology; or (7) elimination of 40-day count and other unintended incentives to allow students to be truant after a certain time of school year. Authorizes the Attorney General to give priority to funding programs that attempt to replicate specified model programs. Authorizes appropriations."
