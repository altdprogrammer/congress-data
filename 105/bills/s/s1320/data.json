    "text": "Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1997 - Presumes to be service-connected (and therefore compensable or treatable under Federal veterans' benefits provisions) any illness that: (1) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines to warrant such a presumption based upon a positive association with exposure to a biological, chemical, or other toxic agent or environmental or wartime hazard (agent or hazard) associated with service in the southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; and (2) becomes manifest in a Gulf War veteran within a period to be prescribed by the Secretary. Requires such presumption even though there is no record of evidence of such illness in the veteran during the period of service. Requires the Secretary to make determinations under (1), above, based on sound medical and scientific evidence and to take into account reports submitted by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) as required under this Act. Requires the Secretary to make appropriate determinations within 60 days after receipt of the NAS report. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the NAS under which NAS shall identify: (1) the agents or hazards to which Gulf War veterans may have been exposed; and (2) the illnesses that are manifest in such members. Directs NAS, after such identification, to determine whether a statistical association exists between exposure to such agent or hazard and the illness. Requires NAS to separately review potential treatment models for such illnesses, make recommendations for additional studies, and perform subsequent reviews of available evidence and data. Requires periodic reports from NAS to the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, and the veterans and defense committees (designated committees) concerning NAS activities under this Act. Terminates requirements and activities under this Act ten years after NAS submits its first report. Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with an alternative scientific organization if agreement cannot be reached with NAS. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a plan for the establishment and operation of a single computerized information data base for the collection, storage, and analysis of information on illnesses of, and treatment provided to, Gulf War veterans. Requires such plan to be submitted to the Secretary of Defense, NAS, and the designated committees. Directs NAS to evaluate and report on such plan. Requires the Secretary to: (1) continually compile and analyze all appropriate clinical data contained in the data base; and (2) report annually, along with the Secretary of Defense, to the designated committees with respect to the analysis of such data. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs, Defense, and Health and Human Services to jointly carry out, and report to the designated committees on, a program of feasibility studies for conducting additional scientific research on health hazards resulting from exposure to agents or hazards associated with Gulf War service. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to carry out an ongoing program to provide Gulf War veterans with information relating to any health risks determined to be associated with such service, together with services or benefits available."
