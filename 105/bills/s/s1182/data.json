Permits such statutes to contain rescissions of budget authority. Bars designation of new budget authority, outlays, or receipts as emergency requirements if a statute contains non-emergency designations but authorizes the statute to contain provisions that reduce direct spending. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish a point of order against the consideration of emergency measures containing non-emergency appropriations or matters not relevant to the emergency. Authorizes points of order for extraneous matter against any provision violating such requirement. Permits such measures to contain rescissions of budget authority or reductions of direct spending or to reduce amounts for the emergency."
