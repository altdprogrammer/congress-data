Requires inclusion in such explanation of a copy of the most recent report comparing the organizations that Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to enroll with. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish such comparative reports according to prescribed criteria in an understandable standardized format. Applies the same new requirements to Medicare select policies. Directs the Secretary to establish a clearinghouse and, if appropriate, a toll-free telephone hotline to provide for dissemination of such comparative reports."
