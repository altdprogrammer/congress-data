    "text": "Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act of 1997 - Prohibits the use of appropriated funds by any U.S. employee, department, or agency to: (1) seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the removal or reduction by any foreign country of any nondiscriminatory law that restricts the advertising, manufacture, packaging, taxation, sale, importation, labeling, or distribution of tobacco products; or (2) promote the export, advertising, manufacture, sale, or distribution of tobacco products. Makes it unlawful to export from the United States, or to sell or distribute in, or export from, any other country, any cigarettes whose package does not contain a warning label (including Federal labeling format and Federal rotation requirements) that: (1) complies with Federal labeling requirements for cigarettes manufactured, imported, or packaged for sale or distribution within the United States; and (2) is in the primary language of the country in which the cigarettes are intended for consumption. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if the importing country has similar or more stringent labeling requirements. Sets forth penalties for violation of this Act."
