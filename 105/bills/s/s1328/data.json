    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-10-28", 
    "text": "Communications Satellite Competition and Privatization Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to prohibit the issuance or renewal of any licenses or construction permits to, or the authorization of use of space segments owned by, any separated entity unless the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determines that such activities will not harm competition in the U.S. telecommunications market. Defines a \"separated entity\" as a privatized entity to whom a portion of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization's (INTELSAT) or the International Mobile Satellite Organization's (Inmarsat) assets are transferred prior to their full privatization. Requires the FCC to limit or revoke the authority to use space segments owned or operated by INTELSAT or Inmarsat to provide non-core services to, from, or within the United States unless after January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2001, INTELSAT and Inmarsat, respectively, and their successor entities, have been privatized in a manner that will not harm competition in the U.S. telecommunications markets. Limits expansion of INTELSAT and Inmarsat services pending privatization of such entities. Prohibits the FCC from assisting in the registration of new orbital slots for INTELSAT or Inmarsat after January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2001, respectively, unless such entities have been privatized in a manner that will not harm competition. Directs the President and the FCC to secure a pro-competitive privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat that meets specified criteria, including requirements that: (1) INTELSAT and Inmarsat are privatized by January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2001, respectively; (2) successor and separated entities are national, stock corporations independent of signatories that control access to telecommunications markets and of any intergovernmental organizations; (3) preferential treatment is terminated; (4) expansions are prohibited during transition; (5) successor or separated entities apply through national licensing authorities for international frequency assignments and orbital registrations; (6) such entities are domiciled in countries that have laws and regulations that secure competition in telecommunications services, are signatories of the World Trade Organization Basic Telecommunications Services Agreement, and have a schedule of commitments in the Agreement that includes non- discriminatory market access to satellite markets; (7) unused orbital slots are returned to the International Telecommunication Union; and (8) INTELSAT's and Inmarsat's assets are audited before transfer. Lists specific additional licensing criteria for INTELSAT, INTELSAT separated entities, and Inmarsat. Requires the FCC to permit providers or users of telecommunications services to obtain direct access to INTELSAT and Inmarsat telecommunications services by January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2000, respectively, and to treat the communications satellite corporation (COMSAT) as a nondominant carrier on the effective date of such actions. Permits multiple signatories to represent the United States in INTELSAT and Inmarsat on such dates. Authorizes the FCC to impose regulatory fees on the U.S. signatory. Prohibits the FCC from assigning orbital slots or spectrum used for international or global satellite communications services by competitive bidding."
