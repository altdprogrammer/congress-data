Allows vocational training programs for children of veterans to begin on the child's 18th birthday or upon completion of the child's secondary schooling, whichever occurs first. Makes conforming changes to effective dates with regard to the spina bifida provisions as contained in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997."
