    "text": "50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act - Amends Federal law to mandate redesign of quarter-dollar coins issued during the ten-year period beginning 1999, with the reverse side emblematic of five of the 50 States each year during such period, selected in the order of their ratification of the U.S. Constitution or their admission to the Union. United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 - Amends Federal law to mandate that the dollar coin shall: (1) be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, with tactile and visual features making it readily discernible; (2) be minted and fabricated in the United States; and (3) have similar metallic anticounterfeiting properties as U.S. clad coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to place into circulation $1 coins that comply with such mandate upon depletion of the Government's supply of $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to mint and issue $1 Susan B. Anthony coins if they are depleted before production has begun of the new $1 coins mandated by this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) adopt a marketing program promoting the use of $1 coins by commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities, and Federal, State, and local government agencies; and (2) conduct a marketing study and report its progress results to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to mint and issue for a limited period ten-dollar gold coins, one-dollar silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins emblematic of the first flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903. Precludes this Act from being construed as evidence of any intention to eliminate or limit the printing or circulation of United States currency in the $1 denomination. Mandates prompt payment of all surcharges received from coin sales to the First Flight Foundation to: (1) maintain the Wright Brothers Monument on the Outer Banks of North Carolina; and (2) expand and maintain the visitor center and other facilities at the Wright Brothers National Memorial Park."
