Excludes from the value of the gross estate, in specified circumstances, the lesser of: (1) the adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business interests of the decedent otherwise includible in the estate; or (2) $1 million, reduced by the amount of an exclusion allowed with respect to the estate of a previously deceased spouse of the decendent. Increases the portion of the estate tax subject to the four-percent interest rate applicable to an extended estate tax payment time where the estate consists largely of a closely held business."
