Directs the Secretary of the Navy, after assessing the feasibility and advisability of breaking up naval vessels and Maritime Administration vessels in U.S. shipyards, to carry out a demonstration program by competitively awarding a cost contract to each of two qualified U.S. shipyards to break up a group of vessels consisting of any stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and any under the jurisdiction of the Maritime Administration."
