Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) procedures with respect to a special motion to strike; (2) qualified exemption of such associations from third-party discovery; (3) a special motion to quash a subpoena on the grounds that the trade or professional association is exempt from any third-party discovery request; (4) procedures with respect to a special motion to quash; (5) the right of such associations to object under rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Procedure or any similar rule or procedure under applicable State law; (6) a qualified association member privilege not to disclose confidential information received from the association relating to litigation involving the quality, performance, or defect of a product; (7) election of a State to be exempt from the requirements of this Act with respect to any civil action in a State court in which all of the parties are citizens of that State; and (8) preemption of State laws."
