Authorizes the President to submit to the Congress with respect to a country a certification specifying: (1) that the withholding of assistance and opposition to multilateral development bank assistance to the country are not in the national interests of the United States; and (2) conditions that must be met to terminate a prohibition of bilateral and multilateral assistance to such country. Prohibits bilateral assistance, and requires the U.S. Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote against any loan or other fund assistance, to such country until such conditions have been met."
