    "text": "Healthy Children's Pilot Program Act of 1997 - Mandates grants to a State for planning and establishing a pilot program to provide vouchers to eligible children to enable the children to enroll in a health plan offered in the State. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for a payment to each participating State for (unless appropriations are insufficient) 100 percent of the voucher cost and five percent of administration expenses. (Sec. 7) Ties eligibility to: (1) income, excluding children who are eligible for medical assistance under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act; (2) age; and (3) citizenship or lawful permanent residency. Regulates voucher amounts. (Sec. 9) Establishes the Healthy Children's Trust Fund. Appropriates amounts from the Fund to carry out this Act. (Sec. 11) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to modify license application competitive bidding requirements. Requires the Federal Communications Commission to conduct, by competitive bidding, the assignment of licenses for specified frequency bands. Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to provide for the reallocation of bands currently used by the Federal Government. Modifies reallocation and distribution of frequency requirements."
