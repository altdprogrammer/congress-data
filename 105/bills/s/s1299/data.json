Mandates withdrawal of a proposed rulemaking and prohibits issuing any other proposal until after a specified meeting and extensive consultations with stakeholders. Requires, after that meeting: (1) a new proposed rulemaking setting forth the initial strategy for facilitating the U.S. transition to metered-dose inhalers that do not use chlorofluorocarbons; and (2) submission of the strategy to the Montreal Protocol Secretariat to fulfill U.S. obligations under a specified Protocol decision."
