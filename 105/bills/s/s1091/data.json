    "date": "1997-07-30", 
    "text": "Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to authorize appropriations for FY 1998 through 2003 for maintenance of Indian reservation school roads. Amends Federal highway law to define Indian reservation school road as a public road that is: (1) within, adjacent to, or provides access to an Indian reservation (including associated trust land and restricted Indian land) having a land area of ten million acres or more; and (2) used by a school bus to transport children to or from a school or Headstart program. Includes such a road in the Federal lands highway program so that it can be treated under the same uniform policies as roads which are on the Federal-aid system. Requires funds available for Indian reservation school roads to be used by the Secretary of Transportation to pay for their maintenance cost in accordance with this Act. Allows a State or county with such roads on its maintenance system to apply for funding from the Secretary for the roads' maintenance, which the Secretary may grant if the Secretary determines that such funding from other sources is not sufficient to provide maintenance that ensures the safety and welfare of children being transported in a school bus to and from a school or Headstart program. Requires all maintenance work funded under this Act to be performed by: (1) contract awarded by competitive bidding; or (2) a State or county that the Secretary has determined has the ability to administer efficiently funds granted for such maintenance. Directs the Secretary to ensure that funding made available under this Act for Indian reservation school roads' maintenance for each fiscal year is supplementary to and not in lieu of any obligation of funds by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for road maintenance programs on Indian reservations."
