Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with respect to alternative fuel use by light duty Federal vehicles to provide that if such vehicles are not acquired from original equipment manufacturers, existing fleet vehicles may be converted to use alternative fuels at the time of a major vehicle overhaul or rebuild. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to require the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), if appropriate, to permit a Federal fleet to: (1) acquire one heavy duty alternative fueled vehicle in place of two light duty alternative fueled vehicles; and (2) take an additional credit for the purchase and documented use of alternative fuel used in a dual-fueled vehicle, comparable conventionally-fueled motor vehicle, or marine vessel. Title II: Alternative Fuels - Non-Federal Programs - Requires State and local alternative fuel incentives programs to include the goal of introducing substantial numbers of light and heavy duty alternative fuels vehicles and increasing the use of alternative fuels. Conditions State eligibility for Federal assistance upon inclusion in each State plan of an examination of the introduction of converted or acquired light and heavy duty alternative fueled vehicles in State-owned or operated motor vehicle fleets. (Sec. 201) Authorizes the Secretary to provide, upon State request, Federal financial assistance grants for the incremental purchase cost of alternative fuels. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President and the Congress on the volume of alternative fuel consumed. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide financial assistance to States and political subdivisions for the incremental cost of alternative fuels used in flexible fueled school buses and school bus conversions to alternative fueled vehicles. (Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on alternative fuel use in marine vessels. Title III: Availability and Use of Replacement Fuels, Alternative Fuels, and Alternative Fueled Vehicles - Modifies the mandate for alternative fuel providers to include regulation of heavy duty trucks. (Sec. 301) Cites circumstances under which the Secretary may allow the conversion of an existing fleet vehicle into a dual-fueled alternative fueled vehicle at the time of a major vehicle overhaul or rebuild. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to: (1) include heavy duty motor vehicles in the program to promote the development and use in light duty motor vehicles of domestic replacement fuels; and (2) review every five years a development plan and production goals for replacement fuel supply and demand. (Sec. 304) Modifies the fleet program purchase goals to require that specified percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired in each model year be acquired as, or converted into, alternative fueled vehicles. Modifies the fleet requirement program to direct the Secretary to permit fleets to substitute the acquisition or conversion of one heavy duty alternative fueled vehicle for two light duty vehicle acquisitions to meet program requirements. Permits a fleet owner to convert an existing fleet vehicle into an alternative fueled vehicle, and purchase the fuel for such vehicle for compliance purposes, if the original equipment manufacturer's warranty continues to apply to the vehicle. Allows a fleet owner a credit for such conversion. (Sec. 305) Instructs the Secretary to allocate a credit to a fleet or covered person that acquires a volume of alternative fuel equal to the estimated need for one year for any dual-fueled vehicle acquired or converted under this Act. Sets forth a credit allocation scheme for dual-fueled vehicles and alternative fuel. (Sec. 306) Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress recommended requirements for exempting replacement fuels from taxes levied on non-replacement fuels if the Secretary notifies the Congress that a fleet requirement program is not necessary."
