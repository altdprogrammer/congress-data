(Sec. 106) Requires the IRS to pre-notify a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business whenever it issues a summons to another person concerning the taxpayer's trade or business, unless such notification would jeopardize the investigation. (Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary, at least 60 days prior to issuing a notice of deficiency, to notify the taxpayer of any proposed adjustments. Permits the taxpayer to appeal the Secretary's proposal. Title II: Penalty Reform - Revises provisions concerning interest penalties for failure to pay taxes.

Title III: Internal Revenue Service Restructuring - Establishes within the Department of the Treasury the Internal Revenue Service Board of Governors which shall review and approve: (1) strategic plans of the IRS; (2) operational functions of the IRS; (3) the IRS Commissioner's selection, evaluation, and compensation of senior managers; and (4) the IRS budget request.

(Sec. 305) Directs the Board to convene a taxpayer-communications advisory group which shall: (1) review all standard IRS written communications, forms and instructions; and (2) recommend such revisions to such documents as will render them more easily understood.
