    "text": "Federal Vacancies Compliance Act of 1998 - Amends Federal law provisions commonly referred to as the Vacancies Act to prohibit an individual who performs the duties of an office in any executive agency (other than the General Accounting Office) that has been filled temporarily in excess of any 120-day period time limitation under such Act from receiving pay for each day such duties are performed. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, on the first day of each month, to submit to the Comptroller General a report containing: (1) the name of each officer filling an office temporarily as described; (2) the date on which each officer named began filling the applicable office temporarily; (3) the date upon which each office being temporarily filled became vacant; and (4) the date upon which any nomination to fill any such vacancy was submitted to the Senate. Requires the Comptroller General, upon making a determination that a violation of any 120-day period time limitation has occurred, to submit a report of such determination to each House of the Congress, the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Office of Personnel Management. Prescribes that the provisions of the Vacancies Act shall supersede any other provision of law, except any provision that: (1) specifically cites any such section of the Act; and (2) states that such provision specifically supersedes such section of the Act."
