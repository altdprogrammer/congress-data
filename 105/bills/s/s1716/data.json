    "text": "Sonny Bono Memorial Salton Sea Restoration Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to prepare an action plan to restore the Salton Sea, located in Imperial and Riverside Counties, California. Outlines plan requirements, including reducing and stabilizing salinity, stabilizing surface elevation, restoring fish and wildlife resources, and enhancing recreational use and economic development. Requires the plan to include a feasibility study of the various alternatives for such remediation, the development of one or more of such options, and the development of a remediation plan implementing such options. Requires the feasibility study to be completed under a memorandum of understanding between the Secretary, the Salton Sea Authority, and the Governor of California. Preserves all current rights and obligations concerning Colorado River water use. Requires an interim and final report from the Secretary to the Congress on the findings and recommendations of the action plan. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary, 30 days after submission of such final report, to carry out a Salton Sea remediation project based on the preferred option recommended in the final report, unless otherwise directed by the Congress. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, concurrently with the action plan, to enter into contracts, cooperative grants and agreements with Federal and non-federal entities to conduct studies of hydrology, wildlife pathology, and toxicology relating to wildlife resources of the Salton Sea. Directs the Secretary to establish the Salton Sea Research Management Committee to make recommendations to the Secretary on study topics and their management. Authorizes appropriations. Renames the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge as the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. Requires the Secretary, if it is determined during such studies that environmental conditions at the Salton Sea warrant immediate emergency action to stabilize salinity, to report to the Congress on such conditions and make recommendations for remediation."
