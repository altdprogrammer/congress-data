(Sec. 5) Prohibits funds allocated for a covered Indian tribe from being used to make per capita payments to tribe members.

(Sec. 6) Sets forth provisions concerning the effect of payments to a covered Indian tribe or an individual on eligibility for, or the reduction or denial of, Federal benefits. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to distribute a specified amount to the lineal descendants of the Sisseton and Wahpeton Tribes of Sioux Indians. Requires ancestral verification of such descendants. (Sec. 8) Sets forth procedural requirements for civil actions brought by or on behalf of a lineal descendant or any group or combination thereof to challenge the constitutionality or validity of such distributions."
