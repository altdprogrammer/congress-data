Title II: Qualified Teachers - Amends ESEA to require States, as a condition for receiving ESEA funds, to ensure a qualified teacher in every classroom, through the following specified measures. Requires, within five years after enactment of this Act, each public school teacher to have demonstrated the subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill necessary to teach effectively in the content area or areas in which the teacher provides instruction. Allows State or local educational agencies to grant temporary waivers, of up to three additional years, of such teacher demonstration requirements in response to emergency teacher shortages or other circumstances. Prohibits any student from being taught for more than one year in elementary or more than two consecutive years in secondary school by a teacher who has not made such demonstration. Requires States to provide: (1) incentives for teachers to pursue and achieve advanced teaching and subject area content standards; (2) effective mechanisms to remove incompetent or unqualified teachers; and (3) help to schools, particularly those in high need areas, to recruit and retain qualified teachers. Title III: Federal Funds Used in the Preparation of Teachers - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to set forth minimum teacher training standards for higher education institutions that receive HEA or other Federal funds to prepare or train teachers. Requires such institutions to: (1) meet nationally recognized professional standards for accreditation, or demonstrate to the Secretary of Education that at least 90 percent of their graduates who enter the field of teaching take, and pass on their first attempt, the State teacher certification or licensure examination for new teachers that is in place on the day of enactment of this Act; and (2) ensure that the graduates hold a liberal arts degree in addition to professional education courses leading to State teacher certification or licensure. Title IV: Incentives for Increasing the Supply of Qualified Teachers - Amends HEA to provide for cancellation of guaranteed and direct student loan indebtedness in return for specified periods of teaching service in high-need disadvantaged areas. Title V: Beginning Teacher Recruitment and Support - Amends HEA to establish a Beginning Teacher Recruitment and Support program. Directs the Secretary to award competitive three-year grants to partnerships to recruit, train, and support qualified entry-level elementary school or secondary school teachers to teach in eligible schools. Makes eligible, for teachers from such program, schools whose enrollment of disadvantaged children exceeds 30 percent of their total enrollment. Gives priority to applications from partnerships that include certain teacher preparation institutions that support or have plans to support professional development schools or laboratory schools and that are not subject to specified waivers. Title VI: General Provisions - Declares that this Act does not apply to nonrecipient nonpublic schools and home schools."
