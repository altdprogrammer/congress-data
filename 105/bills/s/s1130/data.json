    "text": "Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to repeal specified funding provisions for the National Indian Gaming Commission. Replaces them with provisions directing the Commission to: (1) require each gaming operation that conducts class II or class III gaming activity that is regulated by the Act to pay to the Commission, on a quarterly basis, a minimum regulatory fee of $250; and (2) establish a schedule of fees to be paid to the Commission that includes fees for each class II and class III gaming activity that is regulated by the Act. Limits: (1) the rate of fees imposed for each class II and class III gaming activity covered under that schedule that is regulated by the Act; and (2) the total amount of fees imposed during any fiscal year under the schedule established. Prohibits aggregate fee amounts collected from exceeding specified limitations. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a special fund into which amounts equal to the fees paid shall be deposited to be used to fund the Commission's activities. Revises: (1) Commission budget content requirements; and (2) authorization of appropriations provisions."
