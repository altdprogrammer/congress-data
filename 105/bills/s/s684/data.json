Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide assistance for emergency operating expenses incurred by a local educational agency (LEA) in educating students in elementary and secondary schools who have been displaced by a disaster when: (1) the LEA serves an area in which a major disaster has been declared by the President; (2) the State's Governor has certified the need for such assistance; (3) the LEA is or will utilize all State and other financial assistance available for such purpose; and (4) the LEA has made provisions for the conduct of educational programs in which children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools may attend and participate, except that no payments shall be made for religious worship or instruction. Authorizes such assistance for a period beginning on the date that the disaster is declared by the President and ending 18 months thereafter. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the FEMA Director, pending such appropriations, to expend funds from amounts currently available to FEMA or the Director in order to provide immediate assistance. Requires a report to the Congress on any such immediate assistance."
