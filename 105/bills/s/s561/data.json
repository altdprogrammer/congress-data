  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-04-10", 
    "text": "Prisoner Work and Responsibility Initiative of 1997 - Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to require a State, to be eligible for grants for correctional facilities, to provide assurances that it: (1) has implemented requirements that each inmate perform not less than 48 hours of work per week (with exceptions for security, disciplinary, or medical reasons) and engage in not less than 16 hours of organized educational activities per week; and (2) prohibits prison officials from providing privileges to any inmate who fails to comply with such requirements. Includes among such privileges: (1) access to television, bodybuilding or weightlifting equipment, and recreational sports; (2) unmonitored telephone calls, except when between the inmate and the immediate family or inmate's attorney; (3) food exceeding in quality or quantity that which is available to enlisted U.S. Army personnel; and (4) equipment or facilities for publishing or broadcasting material not approved by prison officials as being consistent with prison order and discipline. Replaces a provision authorizing a reduction of sentence for a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense who successfully completes a substance abuse treatment program with one directing the Attorney General to ensure that each eligible prisoner participates in a program of substance abuse treatment. Redefines \"eligible prisoner\" as one who, within 24 months of the date of release or otherwise, is designated by the Bureau of Prisons for participation in a residential substance abuse treatment program."
