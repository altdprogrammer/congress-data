Requires that the Government prove an allegation of a false health care claim by clear and convincing evidence. Defines, for the amendments made by this Act, \"federally funded health care program\" to mean a program that provides health benefits, directly or otherwise, established under Social Security Act titles XVIII (Medicare), XIX (Medicaid), or XXI (Children's Health Insurance) or provisions of Federal law relating to the armed forces."
