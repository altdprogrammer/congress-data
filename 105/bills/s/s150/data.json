Provides disclosure exceptions, such as for the protection of intelligence agents and informants or for compelling national security reasons. Requires disclosure of information that can be reasonably separated from excepted information. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to provide that the exemption from public disclosure authorized under such Act for operational files of the Central Intelligence Agency shall not apply to information regarding Nazi war crimes participants."
