Requires each agency to: (1) identify any proposed regulatory and statutory provision that may have significant potential negative impact on the family well-being; and (2) provide adequate rationale for the submission of such proposal. Requires the head of each agency to certify to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): (1) such proposed regulatory or statutory provision has been assessed in accordance with this Act; and (2) the manner in which such proposals will enhance family well-being. Directs OMB to take action to ensure that the policies of agencies are applied consistent with the assessments conducted under this Act. Directs the White House Office of Policy Development to: (1) assess existing and proposed policies and regulations that affect family well-being in accordance with this Act; (2) provide evaluations on such policies and regulations to OMB; and (3) advise the President on policy and regulatory actions that may be taken to strengthen the institutions of marriage and family in the United States. Requires the Office of Policy Development to annually submit a report to the President and specified congressional committees on compliance and include any recommendations relating to this Act."
