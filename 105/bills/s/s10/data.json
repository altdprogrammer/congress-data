(Sec. 102) Authorizes juveniles age 14 years or older to be tried as adults, at the discretion of the U.S. Attorney, in Federal district court for violations of Federal law which are serious violent felonies or serious drug offenses or which are other felony offenses, if the U.S. Attorney certifies that there is a substantial Federal interest to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction or that the ends of justice otherwise so require. Authorizes the U.S. Attorney, upon declining prosecution of the charged person as a juvenile, to refer the matter to the appropriate legal authorities of the State or Indian tribe with jurisdiction over both the offense and the juvenile. Subjects juveniles prosecuted as adults in U.S. district court to the same procedures and penalties as adults. Makes mandatory restitution provisions applicable to juveniles tried as adults for specified offenses.

Authorizes the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to release such records under specified circumstances. Requires the court, in the case of a defendant convicted for conduct that occurred before the juvenile attained age 16, to impose a sentence without regard to any statutory minimum sentence upon finding at sentencing, after affording the Government an opportunity to make a recommendation, that the juvenile has not been previously adjudicated delinquent for, or convicted of, a serious violent felony or a serious drug offense. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to: (1) amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to require that prior juvenile convictions and adjudications for crimes of violence, controlled substance offenses, any other offense for which the defendant received a sentence or disposition of imprisonment for one year or more, and any other offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year for which the defendant was prosecuted as an adult, receive a criminal history score for any juvenile offender being sentenced as an adult similar to that which the defendant would have received if those offenses had been committed as an adult, provided that any portion of the sentence had been imposed or served within 15 years; (2) determine whether the criminal history treatment of juvenile adjudications or convictions for other offenses should be similarly adjusted and make any additional guideline amendments necessary; (3) assign criminal history points for juvenile adjudication based principally on the nature of the acts committed, adjusting the score in light of the length of sentence the juvenile received; (4) submit emergency guidelines or amendments to the Congress; and (5) amend the guidelines to provide for inclusion in any determination of whether a juvenile or adult defendant is a career offender, and in any computation of such defendant's sentence, of any act for which the defendant was previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile that would be a felony if committed as an adult. (Sec. 104) Modifies code provisions regarding custody prior to appearance before a magistrate to direct that: (1) the arresting officer notify the U.S. Attorney of the appropriate jurisdiction as soon as practicable and promptly take reasonable steps to notify the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian of custody; and (2) the juvenile not be subject to detention under conditions that permit prohibited physical contact or sustained oral communications with adult inmates.

Authorizes the court to enter an order of restitution. Requires that any such imprisonment be terminated on the juvenile's 26th birthday and prohibits a juvenile sentenced to a term of imprisonment from being released from custody simply because the juvenile reaches age 18. (Sec. 108) Permits Federal criminal records to be provided to law enforcement agencies where the request is related to analysis requested by the Attorney General and to schools or other educational institutions to ensure public safety and security. Replaces code provisions providing for the release of such records in response to inquiries from victims or their families with provisions permitting the release of communications with any such victim or the victim's official representative to apprise such individual of the status or disposition of the proceeding, to effectuate any other legal provision, or to assist in a victim's allocution at disposition.
