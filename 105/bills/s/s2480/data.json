Subjects to treatment: (1) imported wood articles prior to and after U.S. entry; and (2) pallets and solid wood packing materials used to import materials into the United States. Prohibits the U.S. entry of such pallets and packing materials after a specified interim period. (Sec. 6) Establishes a Plant Health and Ecosystem Protection Task Force which shall develop criteria for phytosanitary procedures to minimize the introduction or dispersion of nonindigenous pests and pathogens. (Sec. 7) Subjects wood article importers to license and fee requirements. (Sec. 8) Establishes in the Treasury the Pest Reduction in Wood Articles Fund."
