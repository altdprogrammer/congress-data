    "text": "Railroad Shipper Protection Act of 1997 - Amends Federal transportation law to declare as primary objectives for U.S. rail transportation policy: (1) ensuring effective competition among rail carriers at origin and destination; and (2) maintaining reasonable rates in the absence of such competition. Requires a rail carrier, upon request from a shipper, to establish a rail transportation rate between any two points on the carrier's system where traffic originates, terminates, or may be interchanged. Authorizes such shipper to then challenge the reasonableness of the rate established or the aggregate rate between origin and destination (if the rate established is for part of a through rate). Requires the Surface Transportation Board to find that the rail carrier establishing a challenged rail rate has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies if such carrier: (1) is the only carrier serving the origin, destination, or intermediate portion of the route involved; or (2) does not prove to the Board that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for that transportation that is less than 180 percent. Terminates Board authority to determine the revenue adequacy of rail carriers. Directs the Board to: (1) review and take appropriate action with respect to the rules and procedures applicable to rate complaints and other complaints filed with the Board by small shippers; and (2) notify specified congressional committees if it determines that additional (legislative) changes in such rules and procedures are appropriate."
