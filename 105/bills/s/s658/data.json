    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-04-25", 
    "text": "Gun Kingpin Penalty Act - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit a person who does not have a Federal firearms license from shipping or transporting, or conspiring to ship or transport, five or more firearms from a State into another State during any period of 12 consecutive months, with intent to transfer all of such firearms to another unlicensed person. Subjects persons who violate this Act to a fine and imprisonment for at least: (1) three years for a first violation; (2) five years for a second or subsequent violation; (3) 15 years if the violation involves more than 50 firearms; (4) ten years if an illegally transported firearm is subsequently used by the recipient, or by any person within three years, in an offense in which a person is killed or suffers serious bodily injury; and (5) 25 years if the violation involves more than 50 firearms and one of the firearms is subsequently used in such an offense. Prohibits the court from imposing a probationary sentence or suspending the sentence of a person convicted of a violation of this Act, or from making any term of imprisonment imposed for a violation run concurrently with any other term imposed on such person by a U.S. court. Makes specified firearms-related offenses predicate offenses under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to hire and employ 200 personnel to enforce the amendments made by this Act."
