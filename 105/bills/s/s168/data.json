    "text": "Directs the Attorney General to require each United States Attorney to: (1) establish an armed violent criminal apprehension task force; and (2) report at least monthly to the Attorney General on the number of defendants charged with, or convicted of, violating specified Federal firearms prohibitions in the district for which the U.S. Attorney is appointed. Amends the Federal criminal code to define \"crime of violence\" to include possession of explosives or firearms by convicted felons (thus making such persons subject to pretrial detention). Provides for up to ten years' imprisonment, a fine, or both for transferring a firearm, knowing (as under current law) or having reasonable cause to believe that such firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Sets a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of: (1) five years for specified criminal code violations by persons with a previous conviction for a violent felony; and (2) ten years (but not more than 20) for certain persons with more than one previous conviction for a violent felony or serious drug offense committed under different circumstances (and bars the court from granting a probationary sentence to such person with respect to such conviction)."
