Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) transfer funds made available for such purpose to the Appalachian Regional Commission, which shall be responsible for administration of the funds; and (2) apportion the funds to the 13 States in the Appalachian region in accordance with each State's portion of the total estimated cost of completion. Makes one-sixth of the funds allocated for construction available for obligation in each of such fiscal years. Sets forth provisions regarding the Federal share (80 percent), delegation of responsibility to the States, advance construction, and contract authority."
