Prescribes certain requirements with respect to the identification of such countries. Requires the USTR to report annually to specified congressional committees on actions taken, and on progress made, in achieving market access for U.S. value-added agricultural products. Authorizes the USTR, with respect to the identification of such foreign countries, to request that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture to review certifications for the facilities of such countries that export meat and other agricultural products to the United States."
