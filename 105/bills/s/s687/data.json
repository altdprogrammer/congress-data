    "text": "Electric System Public Benefits Protection Act of 1997 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Electric System Public Benefits Board the (Board) to establish accounts known as the \"National Electric System Public Benefits Fund\" at financial institutions in order to provide matching funds to States to support programs relating to renewable energy sources, universal electric service, energy conservation, and other public purposes. Prescribes guidelines for funding, distribution, and wires charges. (Sec. 6) Prescribes a minimum schedule for the total amount of electricity sold by non-hydroelectric facilities and generated by renewable energy sources. Prescribes procedural guidelines for renewable energy credits. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to repeal its cogeneration and small power production provisions. (Sec. 7) Prescribes procedural guidelines for: (1) emissions standards and allocations; (2) a monitoring system for pollutants; and (3) emissions credits. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a disclosure system to allow retail consumers to knowledgeably compare retail electric service offerings (including comparisons based on generation source portfolios, emissions data, and price terms); and (2) promulgate regulations accordingly. Declares that failure of a retail company to provide accurate disclosure shall be treated as a deceptive act in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act."
