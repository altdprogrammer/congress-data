    "text": "Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) businesses should adopt drug-free workplace programs; and (2) States should consider incentives to encourage businesses to adopt such programs, such as reductions in workers' compensation or unemployment insurance premiums, tax deductions, or liability limitations. Amends the Small Business Act to establish a drug-free workplace demonstration program, under which the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) may make grants to, and contracts or cooperative agreements with, eligible intermediaries to provide financial assistance to small businesses seeking to establish such a program. Sets forth intermediary eligibility requirements. Requires such a program to include: (1) a written policy, including prohibitions against substances in the workplace and violation consequences; (2) alcohol and drug abuse prevention training for employees; (3) employee drug testing; (4) employee access to an assistance program; and (5) continuing alcohol and drug abuse prevention assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Requires small business development centers to provide information and assistance to small businesses in developing drug-free workplace programs."
