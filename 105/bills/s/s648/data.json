(Sec. 103) Imposes seller liability if the seller failed to exercise reasonable care, made an express warranty, or engaged in intentional wrongdoing. Declares that a failure to inspect is not a failure of reasonable care if there was no reasonable opportunity to inspect or if the inspection would not have revealed the aspect that caused the harm. Makes a seller liable as a manufacturer if the manufacturer is not subject to service or if the claimant would be unable to enforce a judgment. Makes certain persons engaged in the business of renting or leasing liable as a seller, but prohibits liability for the tortious act of another solely by reason of ownership. (Sec. 104) Makes it a complete defense if the defendant proves that the claimant was under the influence of alcohol or a drug and was more than 50 percent responsible. (Sec. 105) Reduces damages by the percentage of harm attributable to misuse or alteration, except for actions involving an employer or co-employee if the employer or co-employee is, under State law, immune from claimant's action.

(Sec. 107) Allows a claimant or defendant in a product liability action to offer to proceed with voluntary, nonbinding alternative dispute resolution.

Allows a supplier, to the extent required and permitted by other law, to be liable if the claimant shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, violation of contractual requirements or specifications. (Sec. 206) Sets forth procedures relating to motions by a supplier to dismiss actions that are subject to this title. Title III: Limitations on Applicability; Effective Date - Makes any circuit court of appeals decision interpreting this Act a precedent for any Federal or State court within that court's geographic jurisdiction.
