    "text": "Sets, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the allowable commercial fisheries and recreational catch quotas for Gulf of Mexico red snapper. Makes those quotas not subject to the performance of bycatch reduction devices that would reduce the amounts of red snapper that may be harvested. Sets the recreational bag limit for day catch. Sets the minimum size limit. Prohibits, during a specified period of years, the establishment of any fishery closing date designed for the preservation of Gulf red snapper that is inconsistent with a recommendation of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Mandates completion of the review of turtle excluding devices (TEDs) regarding whether TEDs serve effectively as functioning bycatch reduction devices and, if so, certification of TEDs as functioning bycatch reduction devices. Requires a peer-reviewed study and report to specified congressional committees estimating the bycatch reduction achieved in the Gulf by bycatch reduction devices."
