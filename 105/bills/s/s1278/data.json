    "text": "United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act - Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act with respect to tariff treatment during a specified transition period of articles from U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act (CBTEA) beneficiary countries planning to become parties to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or countries which have undertaken their obligations under the World Trade Organization on or ahead of schedule. Extends immediate duty- and quota-free treatment to certain textile and apparel articles assembled, and to certain handloomed, handmade and folklore articles originating, in an eligible CBTEA beneficiary country. Directs the President to reduce tariffs on footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and derivatives, watches and watch parts, and certain leather goods to half of the preference Mexican products enjoy under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) relative to imports of the same articles from CBTEA beneficiary countries. Authorizes the President to proclaim further reductions for such articles if a country meets specified criteria. (Sec. 4) Imposes certain penalties on persons or countries that have engaged in, or permitted, the transshipment (based on false claims) of covered textile or apparel products. Directs the President to report periodically to the Congress concerning CBTEA beneficiary countries. Directs the United States International Trade Commission to report biennially to the Congress and the President regarding the economic impact of this Act on U.S. industries and consumers, including its effectiveness in promoting drug-related crop eradication and crop substitution efforts of the CBTEA beneficiary countries. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the President to determine that a country is not providing adequate protection of intellectual property rights under its laws, even if it is in compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. (Sec. 6) Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to postpone until April 1, 2000, a certain exemption from the imposition of specified customs service fees on passengers arriving in the United States by vessel whose journey originated in Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean countries, or U.S. territories or possessions (other than Puerto Rico), or arriving in such places from the United States (thus making such fees applicable until such date)."
