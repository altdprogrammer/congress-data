States that certain surveys of drug use among young people in the United States shall not be prohibited under any law. (Sec. 4) Expands the powers of the Director, to include: (1) requiring the heads of Program agencies to provide the Director with statistics, studies, reports, and any other information regarding Federal control of drug abuse; and (2) making recommendations to the National Drug Control Center on the specific projects that the Director determines will enhance the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy. (Sec. 5) Revises National Drug Control Strategy requirements to include: (1) comprehensive, research-based, specific, long-range goals and performance measures (including specific annual targets expressed in terms of precise percentages) for reducing drug abuse and the consequences of drug abuse in the United States; (2) four-year projections for Program priorities, including budget priorities; and (3) the review of international, Federal, and private sector drug control activities (currently, State and local drug control activities). Revises requirements for the assessment of the reduction of drug availability by certain measurements. Sets forth requirements with respect to the establishment of performance measures by the Director. (Sec. 7) Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Office of Drug Control Policy until September 30, 1999.
