    "text": "Working American Training Voucher Act - Establishes a training voucher system. Directs the Secretary of Labor to make allotments to States with approved plans to assist training entities in service delivery areas (SDAs) in carrying out training voucher programs. Sets forth requirements for: (1) allotments and allocations of funds; and (2) State and local plans. Requires training entities that receive such allocations for SDAs to use such funds to distribute training vouchers to eligible employees so that they may participate in certified training programs. Prohibits such a training entity from providing training programs under this Act. Sets the amount of such a voucher at the lesser of: (1) the amount necessary to pay for such a certified training program for an employee for one year; or (2) $1,000. Conditions eligibility to apply for a training voucher on an employee's being employed by an employer who has: (1) 200 or fewer employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year; or (2) 500 or fewer employees for each such day in such weeks of the current or preceding year, if the application is made during a period for which the State Governor has provided a specified waiver under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
