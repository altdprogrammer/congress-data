    "text": "Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to provide funds to States for purposes of conducting education and outreach activities relating to the health effects on children of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Directs the Administrator to use certain funds made available under this Act to: (1) establish a national education and outreach campaign relating to the effects on individuals of exposure to tobacco smoke and ways to minimize such exposure; and (2) carry out research, and provide for peer review studies, related to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Requires the Administrator to use amounts available from any trust fund established as part of a national settlement on tobacco litigation to carry out such activities. Sunsets such activities 25 years after this Act's enactment date. Applies a specified executive order for the protection of Federal employees and the public from exposure to tobacco smoke in executive branch workplaces to all facilities owned, rented, or leased by all branches of the Federal Government, including independent agencies, and in all outdoor areas under executive, judicial, or legislative branch control. Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit smoking in an aircraft (currently, in the passenger cabin or lavatory) on all scheduled airline flight segments in interstate or intrastate air transportation. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to require all domestic and foreign air carriers to prohibit smoking on any scheduled airline flight within the United States or between a place in the United States and a place outside of it. Applies such smoking prohibitions, with respect to foreign air carriers, only to passenger cabins and lavatories."
