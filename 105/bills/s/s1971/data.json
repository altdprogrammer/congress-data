    "text": "Amends the American Folklife Preservation Act to add the following individuals to the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress: (1) four members appointed by the Librarian of Congress from among individuals widely recognized by virtue of their scholarship, experience, creativity, or interest in American folklife traditions and arts; (2) the President of the American Folklore Society; and (3) the President of the Society for Ethnomusicology. Requires the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to give due consideration to the appointment of individuals who will provide diversity on the Board. Revises provisions regarding reimbursement of travel expenses. Requires Board members to serve without pay and authorizes members who are not regular full-time Federal employees, at the Librarian's discretion, to be reimbursed for actual and necessary traveling and subsistence expenses incurred in the performance of Board duties. (Currently, such members are entitled to receive compensation at rates fixed by the Librarian of up to $100 per diem while serving on business and allowed travel expenses.) Requires the Board to meet at least once each fiscal year. Fixes the annual pay of the Center Director at a minimum of 120 percent of the minimum rate of pay for GS-15 of the General Schedule or a maximum of the pay under level IV of the Executive Schedule. (Currently, the Director's pay is not to exceed the annual rate for GS-18.) Eliminates the position of Deputy Director of the Center. Makes permanent the authorization of appropriations for the Center. Establishes a six-year term for Board members appointed by the Librarian under this Act, with exceptions."
