    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should be commended for their cooperative efforts in the delivery of medical care; (2) DOD and VA should continue to explore new opportunities to enhance the availability and delivery of medical care to beneficiaries by further enhancing such cooperative efforts; and (3) such enhanced cooperation is encouraged for the general areas of access to quality medical care, identification and elimination of impediments to cooperation, and joint research and program development and for the specific areas in which there is significant potential to achieve progress in cooperation in a short term, including computerization of patient records systems, VA participation in TRICARE, pharmaceutical programs, and joint physical examinations. Directs the DOD and VA Secretaries to jointly conduct: (1) a survey of their respective medical care beneficiary populations to identify the expectations of, requirements for, and behavior patterns of such beneficiaries with respect to medical care; and (2) a review of impediments to cooperation in the delivery of medical care. Requires reports to the congressional defense and veterans' affairs committees (the committees). Requires the Secretary of Defense to review and report semiannually to the committees on opportunities for increased VA participation in TRICARE. Directs the Federal Pharmaceutical Steering Committee to: (1) undertake a comprehensive examination of existing pharmaceutical benefits and programs for beneficiaries of Federal medical care programs; (2) review the existing methods for contracting for and distributing medical supplies and services; and (3) report examination results to the committees. Directs the Secretaries to submit to the committees a report on the status of DOD and VA efforts to standardize physical examinations administered to determine or rate disabilities. Provides deadlines for required reports."
