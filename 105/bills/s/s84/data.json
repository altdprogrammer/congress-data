    "text": "Americas Free Trade Act - Requires the President to initiate trade agreement negotiations with Western Hemisphere countries for the reduction and elimination of tariffs and nontariff trade barriers and the establishment of a Western Hemisphere free trade area. Declares that this Act shall not apply to Cuba unless the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) freedom has been restored in Cuba; and (2) the claims of U.S. citizens for compensation for expropriated property have been appropriately addressed. Sets forth determinations the President must make about Cuba before certifying that freedom has been restored. Requires that, once such certification is made, priority be given to negotiation of a free trade agreement with Cuba. Applies the fast-track procedures of the Trade Act of 1974 to implementing bills for trade agreements entered under this Act."
