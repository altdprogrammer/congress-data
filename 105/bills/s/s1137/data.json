    "text": "Slamming Protection Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prescribe criminal penalties for the willful and unlawful execution of changes in a subscriber's selection of a telephone exchange or toll service provider. Authorizes affected subscribers to bring actions for an order to revoke the change and for the award of damages. Permits States to bring civil actions on behalf of residents to enjoin unlawful change practices and to recover damages equal to the actual monetary loss suffered by such residents. Authorizes the court to increase damage awards by up to three times the maximum allowable award for willful and knowing violations. Grants U.S. district courts exclusive jurisdiction over such civil actions. Provides for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to such actions. Grants the Federal Communications Commission the right to intervene in actions. Limits total damages awarded in class actions brought under this Act to three times the total actual damages suffered by members of the class."
