    "text": "Aviation Competition Enhancement Act of 1997 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to allocate slots (arrival and departure spaces) at each slot-controlled airport for assignment to new entrant air carriers (carriers currently not holding slots) and limited incumbent carriers (carriers holding less than 12 slots at a particular airport). Outlines application procedures for the receipt of such slots at high density airports. Requires a priority in the case of proposed service to small and medium airports not currently serving the high density airport to which the application relates. Directs the Secretary to withdraw from major carriers at each airport a specified percentage of slots for auction to qualified applicants through competitive bidding, as long as the auctioned slot will or is likely to increase competition among carriers. Allows only new entrant and limited incumbent air carriers to participate in such auctions. Requires auction revenues to be deposited in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary to conduct a public inquiry and submit to the Congress a report evaluating the competitive bidding process used. Provides special rules, including rules governing the resale or reversion of purchased slots. Directs the Secretary to: (1) initiate a study to determine whether application of the high density rule promotes or hinders airline competition, as well as the impact that changes to such rule would have on air safety; and (2) limit the use of air carrier slots by commuter air carriers. Directs the Secretary to grant exemptions from the perimeter rule (a rule prohibiting aircraft from providing nonstop service between Washington National Airport and an airport that is more than 1,250 miles away) to all air carriers to operate limited frequencies and aircraft on select routes between Washington National and other airports if the Secretary finds that such exemption will: (1) provide air transportation service with network benefits; and (2) increase competition in multiple markets. Requires the Secretary to make certain certifications to specified congressional committees with respect to the quality of air service provided under such exemptions. Requires the Secretary to respond within 90 days of the filing of a complaint by an air carrier that another air carrier has engaged in predatory behavior."
