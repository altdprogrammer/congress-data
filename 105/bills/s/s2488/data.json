    "text": "Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act - Establishes the Northwest Straits Advisory Commission to: (1) monitor the health of the Northwest Straits marine ecosystem; (2) develop scientifically sound economic measurements of ecosystem degradation and environmental protection costs; (3) identify trends and activities adversely affecting, or preventing the restoration of, that ecosystem; (4) develop scientifically sound restoration recommendations, informed by the economic measurements; (5) help facilitate recommendation implementation by developing broad support among the authorities, stakeholder groups, and the public; (6) provide a public forum for discussions of Federal, State, local, tribal, and Canadian policies and actions regarding that ecosystem; (7) inform authorities and the public about that ecosystem and related issues; and (8) consult with tribes in the region to ensure that Commission work does not violate treaty rights. Authorizes the council or commission of each of seven specified counties in the State of Washington to establish a marine resource committee to address marine ecosystem issues within its county and work to achieve the benchmarks of this Act. Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to request the National Research Council to provide an independent review of, and report to the Congress, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, and the Governor of the State of Washington on, the extent to which the Commission has fulfilled the benchmarks of this Act. Establishes the benchmarks, including broad county participation in the committees, net gain in highly ecologically productive nearshore, intertidal, and estuarine habitat, net reduction in shellfish harvest in closed contaminated areas, and increases in key marine indicator species. Mandates an annual Commission report to the public and a final report to the Congress and the President. Terminates the Commission a specified period after enactment of this Act, unless it is reauthorized by the Congress."
