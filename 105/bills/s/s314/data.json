Requires: (1) the Director to review the agency's list and consult with the agency head regarding the contents of the final list for the fiscal year; (2) the agency head to transmit a copy of the list to the Congress and make the list publicly available; (3) the Director to publish in the Federal Register a notice that the list is publicly available; and (4) the agency head to publish a notice regarding, make available to the public, and transmit to the Congress, any subsequent change to the list. Requires the agency head to: (1) review the activities on the list within a reasonable time after such a notice of its availability is published; and (2) use a competitive process (with specified exceptions) and ensure that all costs are considered each time that he or she considers contracting with a private sector source for the performance of an activity on the list. (Sec. 3) Permits an interested party to submit to an agency a challenge of an omission of a particular activity from, or an inclusion of a particular activity on, a list for which a notice has been published. Sets forth procedures governing filing challenges, agency decisions on challenges, appealing such decisions, and agency decisions on such appeals. (Sec. 4) Provides that this Act shall not apply to or with respect to: (1) the General Accounting Office; (2) Government corporations and Government controlled corporations; (3) a part of a department or agency if all of the employees of that part are employees paid from nonappropriated funds of certain instrumentalities of the United States under the jurisdiction of the armed forces; and (4) depot-level maintenance and repair of the Department of Defense."
