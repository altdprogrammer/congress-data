    "text": "Assistive and Universally Designed Technology Improvement Act for Individuals with Disabilities - Provides for research and development of assistive technology and universally designed technology. (Sec. 4) Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (RA) to require the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (Director) to establish a peer review process for the review of applications for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for research and development of assistive technology and universally designed technology. (Sec. 5) Directs the Interagency Committee on Disability Research (Committee) to carry out specified functions with respect to research and development of assistive technology and universally designed technology, including developing technology transfer activities. Requires the Director to: (1) establish special task forces and subcommittees of the Committee for research and development of assistive technology and universally designed technology, including ones related to medical rehabilitation, technology (including universal design), and the employment of individuals with disabilities; (2) issue a biannual report announcing the availability of the grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements through Federal departments and agencies represented on the Committee for research and development of assistive technology and universally designed technology; and (3) submit results and analyses of such research and development activities, Committee activities, and periodic surveys of manufacturers and suppliers of such technology, to the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration for inclusion in an annual report to the Congress. Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to require the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (Consortium) to develop and disseminate specified information to all Federal, State, and local agencies and instrumentalities involved in assistive technology and universally designed technology. Requires the Director to: (1) participate annually in the Consortium's national and interagency meetings; (2) coordinate the activities of the Federal laboratories with respect to research and development of assistive technology and universally designed technology; and (3) use Consortium resources to identify potential public and private sector partners for research and development collaboration regarding assistive technology and universally designed technology. (Sec. 6) Amends the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act of 1988 to revise requirements for the microloan program under which the Secretary of Labor awards grants to States for alternative funding mechanism programs to allow individuals with disabilities to purchase assistive and universally designed technology devices, products, and services. Requires such programs to maximize consumer participation. Requires such grants to be awarded on the basis of State population. Extends through FY 2001 the authorization of appropriations for the microloan program. (Sec. 7) Amends the RA to extend through FY 2001 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, including specified expenses of the Interagency Committee on Disability Research, the Rehabilitation Research Advisory Council, and peer review panels; and (2) various research activities, including assistance for research and development on assistive technology and universally designed technology."
