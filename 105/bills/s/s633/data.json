Requires the city to provide the NPS with design specifications for certain construction initiated within a Monument utility corridor. Amends the Petroglyph National Monument Establishment Act of 1990 to: (1) revise Federal acquisition authority (and conditions) with respect to lands owned by the State or a political subdivision within Monument boundaries; (2) adjust the Monument boundary to exclude the Paseo Del Norte Corridor in the Piedras Marcadas Unit as described in a specified document; and (3) authorize the Secretary to employ current city employees assigned to the Boca Negra or Piedras Marcadas units of the Monument if responsibility for the operation, maintenance, and repair of property within such units is transferred to NPS. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to allow the use of the existing access road to the Double Eagle II Airport for visitor access to the Monument."
