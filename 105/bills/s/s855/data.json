Directs the head of each Federal agency to: (1) establish the location of each service oriented office in an area with parking facilities accessible to the public; (2) take such actions as necessary to remove any computer game program not required for the official business of the agency from any agency computer equipment; and (3) prohibit the installation of any computer game program not required for the official business of the agency into agency computer equipment. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit the head of a Federal executive agency from accepting delivery of computer equipment loaded with game programs not required for an official purpose under the terms of the contract under which the equipment is delivered."
