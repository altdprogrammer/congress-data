Requires OMB to include the amount of any change in revenues as a deficit decrease in estimates and sequestration reports unless such amount is offset by legislation decreasing revenues in an amount not exceeding the amount of such decrease. Sets forth the revenue targets absent growth for FY 1998 through 2002. Considers legislation decreasing revenues in compliance with this Act to be in order for purposes of specified provisions regarding congressional pay-as-you-go points of order and consideration in the Senate."
