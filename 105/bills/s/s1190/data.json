(Sec. 102) Prohibits a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees from accepting contributions used to pay campaign debt 90 days after a general or special election. (Sec. 103) Raises, as specified, contribution limits in a general election for a candidate when an opponent of the candidate and the opponent's authorized committee make certain aggregate expenditures from the opponent's personal funds. Requires a candidate's principal campaign committee to notify the Federal Election Commission of certain excess aggregate expenditures made using the candidate's personal funds. (Sec. 104) Increases and indexes individual and multicandidate political committee contribution limits. Title II: Disclosure Requirements - Requires the disclosure of expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more made by a person (other than a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee) for a communication containing issue advocacy.

States that an authorization shall remain in effect until revoked and may be revoked at any time. Requires disclosure by: (1) a corporations or national banks to shareholders of the amount of each disbursement made for political activities or that otherwise influences Federal elections; and (2) labor organizations to dues paying members and nonmembers the amount of each disbursement made for political activities or that otherwise influences Federal elections, including contributions and expenditures.

(Sec. 302) Revises provisions regarding contributor information accounts of political committees to require specified contributor information for contributions in any amount. (Sec. 303) Prohibits a candidate's authorized committee from depositing or otherwise negotiating a contribution without the complete required contributor information. (Sec. 304) Repeals current reporting provisions regarding electronic filing. Replaces them with new provisions: (1) permitting the filing of FECA reports using computers and facsimile machines; and (2) requiring campaign finance information to be accessible to the public on the Internet and to be publicly available at Commission offices within 24 hours after such information is received by the Commission. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Amends Federal law to repeal the current requirement regarding the mailing of any mass mailing as franked mail by Members of, or Members-elect to, the Congress. Replaces them with a requirement banning Members of, or Members-elect to, the Congress from mailing any mass mailing as franked mail."
