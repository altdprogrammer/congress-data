    "text": "Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1997 - Directs the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture (System Funding Agencies) to make grants to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for the planning and construction of a water supply system to provide service to specified counties in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. Requires the System Funding Agencies to make grants and other funds available to the System and other private, State, and Federal entities for the initial development of the environmental enhancement component. Requires the System to establish a water conservation program that ensures that System users use the best practicable technology and management techniques to conserve water use. Requires periodic review and revision of such program. Specifies that mitigation for fish and wildlife losses incurred as a result of the construction and operation of the water supply system be on an acre-for-acre basis, based on ecological equivalency, concurrent with project construction. Requires the Western Area Power Administration to make available the capacity and energy required to meet the pumping and incidental operational requirements of the water supply system during the period beginning May 1, and ending October 31, of each year from power designated for future irrigation and drainage pumping for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program. Provides that this Act shall not: (1) limit the authorization for water projects in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota; or (2) preempt State water rights. Specifies the Federal and non-Federal share of the cost. Requires the System Funding Agencies to provide funds for the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, equal to 50 percent of the incremental cost of its participation in the project. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allow the Bureau of Reclamation to provide project construction oversight to the water supply system and environmental enhancement component. Authorizes appropriations."
