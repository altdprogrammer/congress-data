(Sec. 6) Repeals provisions authorizing grants and contracts regarding specified international activities, including research, education, and technology transfer. (Sec. 7) Replaces provisions providing for the designation of sea grant colleges and regional consortia with provisions setting forth the criteria for designation as a sea grant college or institute and designee duties.

(Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the Act and for competitive grants for university research on: (1) the zebra mussel; (2) oyster diseases and oyster-related human health risks; and (3) Pfiesteria piscicida and other harmful algal blooms. Mandates notice to specified congressional committees before certain reprogramming of funds and major reorganizations.
