    "text": "Services for Children of Substance Abusers Reauthorization Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that the Director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (currently, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services administration) make grants for: (1) services for children and families of substance abusers; (2) identification of such children and families; and (3) education and training of providers of such services. Adds alcohol and drug evaluation, treatment, and prevention to the services to be provided to children (replacing provisions mandating preventive counseling services). Allows services to be delivered to families through an entity that meets State licensure or certification requirements for that service. Mandates aggressive outreach to family members with substance abuse problems. Modifies requirements regarding: (1) mandated services for substance abusers; (2) grant eligibility; and (3) information submitted by grant applicants. Removes provisions mandating: (1) coordination with the State lead agency and the State Interagency Coordinating Council under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; and (2) peer review as part of the grant awarding process. Authorizes grants for the training of personnel who provide services to vulnerable children and families to assist the professionals in recognizing drug and alcohol problems and to enhance their skills in identifying and obtaining substance abuse prevention and treatment resources. Authorizes appropriations."
