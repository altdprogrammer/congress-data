Instructs the Attorney General to give priority to grant applicants that: (1) have established cooperative agreements with neighboring jurisdictions to facilitate the enforcement of protection orders from other jurisdictions; and (2) will use the grant to develop and install data collection and communication systems linking police, prosecutors, and the courts in order to identify and track protection orders and violations of such orders. (Sec. 101) Directs the Attorney General to compile and disseminate information about successful data collection and communication systems. Amends Federal criminal code provisions governing full faith and credit given to protection orders to provide that such provisions shall not be construed to: (1) require prior filing or registration of such orders in the enforcing State as a prerequisite to enforcement by such State; or (2) permit a State to notify the party against whom the order has been made that a protection order has been registered or filed in that State. Includes custody and visitation provisions in protection orders within the purview of Federal criminal law governing domestic violence and stalking. (Sec. 102) Amends such Act to designate State, local, and Indian tribal courts as eligible grantees in the program to combat violent crimes against women. Revises allocation percentages for police and prosecutors, victim services, and State and local courts (not less than 25 percent, 30 percent, and ten percent, respectively). Amends the Equal Justice for Women in the Courts Act to expand training that may be provided under domestic violence training grants to include training with respect to issues concerning individuals with disabilities. Authorizes appropriations from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for FY 1999 through 2002.

Sets forth provisions regarding application requirements and certifications, grant disbursement, the Federal cost share, nonmonetary assistance, and regulations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2002. (Sec. 107) Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that any person who, while employed by or accompanying the armed forces outside of the United States, engages in conduct that would constitute a domestic violence or sexual assault offense if the conduct had been engaged in within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, shall be subject to prosecution in a U.S. district court. Sets forth provisions regarding concurrent jurisdiction and priority of exercise of jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to designate and authorize any individual serving in a law enforcement position in the Department of Defense to arrest such a person outside of the United States if there is probable cause to believe that such person committed such an offense. Provides for the release of such arrested persons to civilian law enforcement authorities in specified circumstances. Provides for delivery of such persons to the appropriate authorities of a foreign country if: (1) delivery is requested for trial for such conduct as an offense under the laws of that country; and (2) delivery is authorized by a treaty or other international agreement to which the United States is a party. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to transmit to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of records of any penal actions taken, including certain nonjudicial punishments imposed, against a member of the armed forces who is discharged, dismissed, or released from active duty. (Sec. 108) Prohibits and sets penalties for willfully causing bodily injury to any person or attempting, through the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, to cause bodily injury to any person, whether or not acting under color of law, because of: (1) the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person; or (2) the actual or perceived religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability of any person if, in connection with the offense, the defendant or the victim travels in interstate or foreign commerce, uses a facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce, or engages in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or the offense is in or affects such commerce. Authorizes appropriations to the Departments of the Treasury and of Justice for FY 1998 through 2000 to increase the number of personnel to prevent and respond to such alleged violations. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to study and, if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide sentencing enhancements for adult defendants who recruit juveniles to assist in the commission of hate crimes.

(Sec. 111) Modifies Federal criminal code provisions regarding interstate domestic violence, interstate stalking, and interstate violation of a protective order to cover situations where persons travel in interstate or foreign commerce or to or from Indian country. Title II: Strengthening Services to Victims of Violence - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to public and private nonprofit entities: (1) to establish and expand cooperative efforts and projects between domestic violence victim advocacy organizations and civil legal assistance providers to strengthen civil legal assistance for victims of domestic violence; and (2) to establish and expand efforts and projects to strengthen such assistance by organizations with a demonstrated history of responsive direct legal or advocacy services on behalf of such victims. (Sec. 201) Requires the Attorney General, through contracts, grants, or other arrangements, to establish and operate a network of attorneys and lay advocates to provide legal assistance and other guidance to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.

Requires grant applicants to provide documentation, including memoranda of understanding, of the specific involvement of the State domestic violence coalition and other knowledgeable individuals and interested organizations, in the development of the application. Earmarks funds to provide emergency assistance directly to victims of family violence, or their dependents, who are in the process of fleeing an abusive situation. Changes from a formula amount to $500,000 the minimum allotment to each State for such grants. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to Indian tribes and organizations from any sums not distributed to them. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to private nonprofit organizations for information, training, and technical assistance initiatives in specified subject areas. Authorizes appropriations under such Act through 2002. Revises the formula for the allocation of appropriations for grants for State coalitions. Directs the Secretary to conduct a nationwide needs assessment relating to family violence prevention and services programs.

(Sec. 203) Prohibits any insurer from, directly or indirectly, taking any adverse action against: (1) an innocent insured; or (2) an applicant or insured on the basis that the applicant or insured, or any person employed by the applicant or insured or with whom the applicant or insured is known to have a relationship or association is, has been, or may be the subject of abuse. Defines an innocent insured as a subject of abuse insured under the same policy as the abuser, but who is not (in light of all the facts and circumstances) the cause of any claim incurred or that may incur. Requires any insurer taking an adverse action against a known subject of abuse to advise the applicant or insured in writing of the specific reasons for the action. Empowers the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce such prohibitions and policy. Provides for a private action against an insurer by an applicant or insured affected by a violation of this Act.
