    "text": "Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for any person to distribute to the public any violent video programming not blockable by electronic means specifically on the basis of its violent content during hours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promulgate regulations to implement this Act. Authorizes the FCC, as part of its rulemaking proceeding, to exempt programming (including news programs and sporting events) whose distribution does not conflict with the objective of protecting children from the negative influences of violent video programming. Exempts premium and pay-per-view cable programming. Requires the FCC to immediately revoke the license of any person who repeatedly violates this Act and to consider, in its review of an application for a renewal of a license, whether the licensee has complied with this Act. Directs the FCC to: (1) assess the effectiveness of measures taken by this Act; and (2) report assessment findings to specified congressional committees."
