    "text": "Patient Abuse Prevention Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish under the Social Security Act (SSA) title XI health care fraud and abuse data collection program the National Registry of Abusive Workers, which shall collect and maintain data from State registries and other entities on covered health care workers who have been the subject of reports of patient abuse. Outlines requirements for the submission of such information. Requires each covered health care facility to provide for: (1) State criminal background checks for covered health care workers; and (2) a probationary period of employment for such workers pending the completion of such procedures. Provides penalties for violations of such requirement. Provides for a mandatory lifetime exclusion from participation in Medicare and State health care programs of any individual or entity: (1) convicted of a criminal offense involving a crime against bodily security, including child or elder abuse; or (2) found to have knowingly continued to employ an individual so convicted in a position involving direct patient care, or to have knowingly failed to report an individual who has been determined to have committed such a criminal offense. Authorizes the Secretary to exclude from such programs any individual or entity that is or has been the subject of a specific documented finding of patient abuse by a State. Applies such exclusions to any entity eligible for reimbursement under a Federal health care program. Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program to provide grants to develop information on best practices in patient abuse prevention training for managers and staff of hospital and health care facilities. Authorizes appropriations."
