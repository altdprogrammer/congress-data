(Sec. 106) Requires key recovery agents (agents entrusted by other persons to hold information to allow access to data or communications of such persons) to disclose recovery information (a key or other information used to decrypt data or communications) to government entities requesting such information for specified lawful purposes. Sets forth subpoena procedures for entities seeking such disclosures. (Sec. 107) Authorizes civil recovery of damages and litigation costs by persons affected by unlawful disclosures or use of recovery information by the U.S. Government. (Sec. 108) Sets forth procedures for the use and handling of decrypted and recovery information obtained by government entities. Prohibits such entities from using recovery information obtained under this Act to determine the plaintext of wire or electronic communications or of stored electronic information unless granted lawful authority to do so under other provisions of law. (Sec. 110) Prohibits disclosures of the facts or circumstances of releases of recovery information except under order of a Federal court. Title II: Government Procurement - Requires the following to be based on a qualified system of key recovery: (1) encryption products procured by the U.S. Government or purchased with Federal funds for use in secure government or public networks; and (2) communications networks established by the U.S. Government or with Federal funds that use encryption products. (Sec. 207) Prohibits the U.S. Government from mandating the use of encryption standards for the private sector other than for use with U.S. Government computer systems or networks or those created using Federal funds.

(Sec. 302) Sets forth license exceptions for the exports of specified encryption products. (Sec. 303) Authorizes the President to increase the encryption strength for products permitted to be exported. (Sec. 306) Prohibits exports if the Secretary finds that a product would be: (1) used in acts against the national security, public safety, transportation systems, communications networks, or essential systems of interstate commerce; (2) diverted to a military, terrorist, or criminal use; or (3) re-exported without authorization. (Sec. 308) Establishes criminal penalties for specified violations of this title. Title IV: Voluntary Registration System - Authorizes the Secretary to register any person or government or foreign government agency as a certificate authority if such person or agency meets required standards under this Act.

Title VI: International Agreements - Requires the President to: (1) conduct negotiations with other countries for mutual recognition of key recovery agents and certificate authorities and to safeguard privacy and prevent commercial espionage; (2) consider a country's refusal to negotiate such agreements when considering U.S. participation in any cooperation or assistance program with such country; and (3) report to the Congress if negotiations are not complete by the end of 1999. Title VII: General Authority and Civil Penalties - Sets forth authorities of the Secretary to obtain information and impose civil penalties under this Act.
