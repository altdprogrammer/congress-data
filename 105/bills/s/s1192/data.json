    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "North Atlantic Fisheries Resource Conservation Act - Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from authorizing or permitting fishing vessels over 164 feet in length or with over 3,000 horsepower to harvest Atlantic mackerel or herring in a fishery unless their participation is specifically allowed under a fishery management plan developed and implemented under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Requires the Secretary to revoke any permit issued before enactment of this Act which would have permitted such vessels to engage in the harvest. Sets a deadline for: (1) the New England Fishery Management Council to submit an Atlantic herring fishery management plan for the Secretary's implementation; and (2) the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council to submit for the Secretary's implementation an amendment to the Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fisheries which specifically addresses the participation of such vessels in the Atlantic mackerel harvest. Authorizes the inclusion of vessel length or power limitations or modifications in such fishery management plan or amendment."
