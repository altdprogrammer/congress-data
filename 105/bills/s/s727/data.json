Prohibits related enrollment and renewal discrimination, monetary incentives to women, and penalties or incentives to providers. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply those requirements and prohibitions to coverage offered by an issuer in the individual market. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to allow payment for annual screening mammographies for women over 39 (currently, over 49 but under 65) years old. Removes provisions empowering the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise the screening frequency for which payment may be made. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require payment for annual screening mammographies for women over 39 years old."
