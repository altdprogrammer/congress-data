    "text": "ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 - Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for FY 1998 through 2003 for: (1) the National Highway System; (2) the Interstate maintenance program; (3) the surface transportation program; (4) the bridge program; (5) congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program; (6) the minimum allocation program; (7) apportionment adjustments; (8) the Interstate System reimbursement program; (9) certain projects under the Federal lands highways program; (10) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) highway safety programs; and (11) FHWA highway safety research and development. (Sec. 4) Amends Federal-aid highway law to revise the formula for determining the State apportionment of funds for the National Highway System and the surface transportation program. Extends through FY 2003 the set aside of Federal highway funds for discretionary projects for the resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing of routes on the Interstate System (4 R projects). (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of Transportation, not later than April 1, 2000, to report to specified congressional committees recommended adjustments to the formula used to apportion funds to States for the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, and to the amount apportioned for the program, to reflect changes since the enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) in: (1) national ambient air quality standards under the Clean Air Act; and (2) the emission control requirements that result from such standards. Directs the Secretary to withhold ten percent of the apportionments if the recommendations are not enacted into law by October 1, 2000. Revises the formula for the apportionment of funds under the program. Adds transportation projects which will have air quality benefits, and consist of certain intercity rail passenger activities, to the eligible projects that a State may obligate congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program and surface transportation program funds. Limits a State's obligation for such projects to no more than 50 percent of the apportioned funds. (Sec. 6) Extends for an additional six-fiscal year period the obligation of a State to allocate surface transportation program funds for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000. (Sec. 7) Increases the minimum amount of apportioned highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program funds that a State shall receive in any fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 through 2003 for the discretionary bridge program. (Sec. 8) Revises for FY 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter the formula for determining the amount of highway funds that would be required to ensure a State's percentage of the total apportionments in each fiscal year and allocations for the prior fiscal year for specified transportation programs is not less than 90 percent of the percentage that the population of the State is of the population of the United States. (Sec. 10) Provides for the adjustment of funds apportioned to States for the surface transportation program. (Sec. 11) Extends through FY 2003: (1) the strategic highway research program; (2) the applied research and technology program; (3) intelligent transportation systems; (4) the scenic byways program; (5) construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities; and (6) the national recreational trails program. (Sec. 15) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a comprehensive initiative to carry out a comprehensive research program to investigate and understand the relationships between transportation, land use, and the environment; and (2) award transportation and land use planning and policy grants to State, regional, and local agencies, including metropolitan planning organizations. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 16) Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for FY 1998 through 2003 for construction of the Appalachian development highway system."
