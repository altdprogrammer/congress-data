    "text": "No Cash for Convicts Act - Applies to the payment of benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to prisoners the same requirements as enacted by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 with respect to payments under SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) for agreements between the Commissioner of Social Security and State or local correctional institutions for monthly identifying information, and the exchange of such information among Federal or federally-assisted cash, food, or medical assistance programs. Extends to all prisoners, regardless of offense or length of sentence, the current prohibition against the payment of social security benefits, by repealing its limitation to offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. Amends the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to require inclusion of prisoners receiving OASDI benefits in certain required studies and reports to the Congress."
