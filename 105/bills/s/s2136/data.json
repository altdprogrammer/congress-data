    "text": "Interstate 90 Land Exchange Act of 1998 - Provides for: (1) an exchange of private and Federal lands in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie, Wenatchee, and Gifford Pinchot National Forests, Washington, between the Secretary of Agriculture and Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P.; (2) land appraisals, including considerations for critical habitat protection, and equalization requirements; and (3) access to acquired lands. Requires lands acquired by the Secretary to become part of the appropriate national forest. Directs the Secretary to complete determinations under the National Historic Preservation Act and report to Plum Creek on any parcels of land to be conveyed on which use restrictions or mitigation requirements will be imposed. Requires Plum Creek, prior to making an offer to exchange lands under this Act, to notify the Secretary as to: (1) parcels it will accept subject to such restrictions or mitigation requirements; and (2) those it will not accept because such requirements are deemed to be an unacceptable encumbrance on the land. Directs the Secretary to delete parcels deemed unacceptable for conveyance from land selected for exchange."
