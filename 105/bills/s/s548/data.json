Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA) to direct the Secretary of Labor (in carrying out the Older Americans Community Service Employment Program) and the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service, respectively, as well as any grantee or contractor, to take steps, including the development of appropriate special projects, to encourage the fullest participation of eligible older individuals (under DVSA, individuals age 55 or older) in projects to provide child care under such program. Requires that such child care projects, to the extent practicable, be carried out in communities with child care shortages. Title II: Tax Incentives for Dependent Care - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the child and dependent care credit for specified low and middle income workers. Applies the home office tax deduction to the use of such home office for dependent care."
