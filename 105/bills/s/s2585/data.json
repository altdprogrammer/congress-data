Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) make rotavirus gastroenteritis a taxable vaccine for Federal sales tax purposes; and (2) limit the payment of compensation for vaccine-related injury or death to injury or death only from a vaccine which is taxable at the time it is administered (after September 30, 1988). Prohibits appropriations to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund on and after any expenditure from the Fund which is not permitted by specified Federal law."
