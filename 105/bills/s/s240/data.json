Requires the Librarian to establish a Late Book Fine Fund to be available to the Librarian without fiscal year limitation for general operating expenses of the Library of Congress and the replacement of lost or stolen books. Prohibits Federal funds from being used to pay the assessed late fine. Imposes a fine for such violation. Requires the Librarian to include in the annual report submitted to the Congress: (1) the estimated number of books that are missing from the Library due to borrowers who have had loan privileges suspended; (2) the name of any office with an office loan account that includes any borrower who has had loan privileges suspended and has been assessed late fines that have not been paid for more than one month; (3) the total amount of such fines assessed to each named office; (4) all monies deposited in the Fund; and (5) the amounts and uses of expenditures from the Fund."
