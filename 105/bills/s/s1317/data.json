    "text": "Environmental Health Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to require the President to notify State, local, and tribal public health authorities whenever a release (or threat of release) of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant has occurred or is about to occur and such release is under investigation pursuant to CERCLA. Provides that in a public health emergency, exposed persons shall be eligible for referral to licensed or accredited health care providers. (Currently, such persons are eligible for admission to hospitals and other facilities and services operated by the Public Health Service.) Requires the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to prepare toxicological profiles of hazardous substances that are not currently on the list of those that pose a most significant threat to human health but have been detected at covered facilities and are determined to pose a significant potential health threat due to known or suspected toxicity to humans and potential for human exposure. Defines \"covered facilities\" as facilities: (1) that are listed or proposed for listing on the National Priorities List (NPL); (2) at which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is undertaking a removal action that is anticipated to exceed one year or a specified funding limit; or (3) with respect to which the ATSDR Administrator has approved a petition for a health assessment or related health activity. Includes Indian tribes in the list of individuals to whom the ATSDR Administrator is required to provide consultations on health issues related to hazardous substance exposure. Provides for cooperation with Indian tribes with respect to certain ATSDR activities. Directs the ATSDR Administrator to perform a health assessment or related health activity for each covered facility (currently a health assessment for each NPL facility). Applies existing authorities related to assessments to health activities as well. Requires the President and the ATSDR Administrator to exchange information necessary to make a public health determination sufficiently before completion of a remedial investigation and feasibility study to allow full consideration of the public health implications of a release. Bars the delay of progress of a remedial action pending completion of a health assessment or health related activity. Includes cumulative effects of chemicals in the list of factors to be considered in a health assessment. Expands the list of parties to whom completed health assessments and recommendations are to be provided to include Indian tribes, local health officials, community advisory groups, and waste site information offices. Requires the ATSDR Administrator to include in the biennial report on ATSDR activities the health impacts on Indian tribes of hazardous substances from covered facilities. Provides for the distribution of: (1) medical education materials on hazardous substance exposure to local health officials; and (2) educational materials on human health effects of such substances to communities potentially affected by a facility. Requires the ATSDR Administrator to facilitate the provision of environmental health services in communities that: (1) may have been or may be subject to exposure to a hazardous substance from a covered facility; and (2) have a medically underserved population or lack sufficient expertise in environmental health. Directs the ATSDR Administrator, if considered appropriate, to conduct health education activities to make a community near a covered facility aware of the steps the community may take to mitigate or prevent exposure to hazardous substances and the health effects of such substances. Requires the ATSDR Administrator to conduct a study relating to the identification, assessment, and management of, and response to, multiple sources of exposure affecting or potentially affecting a community."
