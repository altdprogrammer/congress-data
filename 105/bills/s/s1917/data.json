    "text": "Child Firearm Access Prevention Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to prescribe penalties in cases where a person keeps a loaded firearm or an unloaded firearm and ammunition to which a juvenile obtains access and causes death or injury, exhibits the firearm in a public place, or possesses the firearm in a school zone. Makes penalties inapplicable in cases where: (1) the person keeping the firearm uses a secure gun storage or safety device for the firearm; (2) the person is a peace officer or a member of the armed forces or National Guard and the juvenile obtains the firearm during, or incidental to, the performance of such person's official duties in that capacity; (3) the juvenile obtains or discharges the firearm in a lawful act of self-defense or defense of others; or (4) the person has no reasonable expectation that a juvenile is likely to be present on the premises where the firearm is kept. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that a copy of the prohibition under this Act appears on the form required to be obtained by a licensed dealer from a prospective transferee of a firearm."
