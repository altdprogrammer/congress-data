(Sec. 223) Declares that grazing of livestock within designated wilderness areas: (1) shall be administered according to specified law and guidelines; and (2) shall not be reduced, increased, or withdrawn, except based solely on scientific analyses of range conditions. (Sec. 224) Declares that any public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management within the Conservation Area in Emery County, Utah, that is not designated as wilderness by this subtitle: (1) shall not be subject to management for preservation as wilderness; but (2) shall be managed for multiple uses and in accordance with certain land management plans. Subtitle C: Other Special Management Areas - Establishes within the Conservation Area a San Rafael Swell Desert Bighorn Sheep Management Area to provide for the prudent management of Desert Bighorn Sheep and their habitat in the Sid's Mountain area of the Conservation Area. (Sec. 231) Prescribes requirements for management and use of the Management Area. Directs the Secretary to include a management plan for the Area in the Conservation Area management plan. (Sec. 232) Directs the Secretary to designate within the Conservation Area certain semi-primitive nonmotorized use areas, which shall provide opportunities for: (1) isolation from the sights and sounds of humans (including their motorized vehicles); (2) a high degree of interaction with the natural environment; and (3) the practice of outdoor skills in settings that present moderate challenge and risk. (Sec. 233) Directs the Secretary to designate within the Conservation Area a specified scenic visual area of critical environmental concern to preserve the scenic value of the Interstate Route 70 corridor. Title III: General Management Provisions - Requires the Secretary to permit domestic livestock grazing within areas of the Conservation Area where grazing was established before enactment of this Act, except in wilderness areas.

Authorizes the United States to acquire and exercise, in accordance with State law, such water rights as necessary to carry out its responsibilities on any land designated as part of the Conservation Area. (Sec. 305) Declares that nothing in this Act affects the State jurisdiction or responsibilities with respect to fish and wildlife management activities. Declares that the Congress does not intend that the designation of the Conservation Area or any wilderness or semi-primitive area lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the area, but only within it. Provides for: (1) the set back of boundaries from roads and rights-of-way; and (2) acquisition of land from non-governmental entities by exchange or purchase only."
