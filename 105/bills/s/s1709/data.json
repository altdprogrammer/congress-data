Makes individuals eligible for such training programs if they are: (1) welfare recipients who are enrolled in welfare transition programs, or who are eligible to be so enrolled but have not participated in such programs; or (2) Federal, State, or local prisoners who will be released within a reasonable period. Limits the duration of an individual's pre-vocational training to between two weeks and three months. Limits the maximum monetary value of such services provided to any eligible individual. Sets forth program requirements relating to State plans, grant award considerations, assistance to and use of funds by community organizations, and monitoring. Authorizes appropriations."
