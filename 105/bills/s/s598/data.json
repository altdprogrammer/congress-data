    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to require public disclosure of amounts paid to court-appointed attorneys upon the court's approval of such payment. Outlines disclosure requirements with respect to: (1) proceedings in pre-trial status or a trial-in-progress; and (2) a payment request which is not made by counsel until after completion of the trial. Allows limited disclosure of such fees in appropriate cases in order to protect a defendant. Requires the court to provide reasonable notice of such disclosure to counsel prior to payment approval to allow the counsel to request redaction of such disclosure in the interests of the defendant. Requires the court to withhold disclosure of such payments until completion of any appeal, unless the defendant's interests will not be compromised."
