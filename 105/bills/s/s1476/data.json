    "text": "Authorizes the President to enter into a free trade agreement with qualified areas of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that provides for: (1) harmonization, reduction and elimination of trade barriers; (2) prohibition of or limitations on the imposition of such barriers; and (3) elimination or reduction of duties imposed by the United States. Sets forth criteria for the duty-free treatment of qualified area products. Limits such qualified areas to areas of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland contiguous to Northern Ireland suffering from the severest form of economic deprivation, with a higher than average unemployment. Requires employers to comply with the MacBride Principles of economic justice. Requires the International Trade Commission, before any reduction or elimination of duty is proclaimed with respect to an article, to advise the President of the probable economic effect of duty-free treatment on U.S. industries producing like or directly competitive articles, and on consumers. Requires the President to consult with the Congress, according to a specified procedure, before entering into, or implementing, any free trade agreement under this Act."
