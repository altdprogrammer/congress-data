Declares that, if within 60 days the Congress adopts a joint resolution of approval, such controls shall remain in effect for the period specified, or until the President terminates them, whichever occurs first. States that if Congress fails to adopt a joint resolution of approval, such controls shall cease to be effective upon the expiration of the initial 60-day period."
