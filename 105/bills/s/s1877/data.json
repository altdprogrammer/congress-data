Requires proposed and final agency rules to analyze their impact upon affordable housing availability. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop model housing impact analyses. (Sec. 5) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to authorize direct appropriations for State and local grants for regulatory barrier removal. (Sec. 6) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to make affordable housing barrier removal eligible for community development block grant assistance. Expresses the sense of the Congress that each block grant recipient should establish a Barriers to Homeownership and Housing Affordability Council. (Sec. 7) States that the regulatory barriers clearinghouse shall be established within the Office of Policy Development of HUD under the direction of the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. (Sec. 8) Amends the National Housing Act to: (1) repeal the single family mortgage insurance owner-occupancy requirement; (2) repeal mortgage limits on dwellings begun prior to insurance approval; (3) revise the definition of \"area\"; and (4) revise downpayment provisions."
