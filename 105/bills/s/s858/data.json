Allows the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY 1998 when the DCI determines that such action is necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions, subject to specified limitations.

(Sec. 305) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the DCI should direct elements of the intelligence community to competitively award contracts in a manner that maximizes the procurement of products properly designated as having been made in the United States; and (2) Members of Congress have equal standing with officials of the executive branch to receive classified information in order to carry out oversight responsibilities. (Sec. 307) Directs the Secretary of State to identify and provide to victims and their families information regarding the killing, abduction, torture, or other serious mistreatment of U.S. citizens abroad.

(Sec. 311) Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to create an exception to a requirement that individuals be notified of credit information obtained concerning such individuals in the case of a U.S. department or agency which seeks to obtain and use such a consumer report for employment purposes when the agency or department head certifies that: (1) such report is relevant to a national security investigation; and (2) there is reason to believe that notification compliance will endanger life or safety, result in flight from prosecution or the destruction of evidence, or otherwise seriously jeopardize or delay an investigation or other official proceeding. Requires the consumer, in such a case, to be notified at the conclusion of the investigation. Requires each agency or department head exercising such authority to report annually to the Congress. Amends the FCRA to prohibit a person who procures a consumer report for resale purposes from disclosing the identity of the end-user of such report if: (1) the end-user is a U.S. department or agency using such report to determine the eligibility of the consumer concerned to receive or have continued access to classified information; and (2) the department or agency certifies to the reselling person that nondisclosure is necessary for the protection of such classified information or the safety of persons conducting or undergoing an investigation for employment with such department or agency. Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to authorize the DCI to enter into multiyear leases for periods of up to 15 years, subject to the availability of appropriations. (Sec. 402) Empowers the CIA Inspector General (IG) with subpoena authority for the production of information, documents, and other data. Requires an annual report from the IG to the intelligence communities on the exercise of such authority.

Provides for: (1) fund assets and reimbursement; (2) DCI imposition of a fee for central services provided from the fund; (3) fund audits by the CIA IG; (4) fund termination on March 31, 2000; and (5) the earmarking of funds authorized under title I of this Act for the working capital fund. (Sec. 404) Extends to the streets, sidewalks, and open areas within 500 feet of the CIA compound the area authorized to be protected for security purposes by CIA employees. (Currently, such area includes only the CIA installations.) Limits the exercise of such authority to those circumstances where the CIA security officers can identify specific and articulable facts supporting the use of such authority to protect against physical damage or injury or threats of such damage or injury. Requires the DCI to report annually to the intelligence committees on the exercise of such authority. (Sec. 405) Requires the administrative location of the Office of the DCI to be within the CIA. Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Activities - Authorizes the award of the degree of Bachelor of Science in Intelligence by the president of the Joint Military Intelligence College.
