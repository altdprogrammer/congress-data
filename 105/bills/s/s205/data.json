    "text": "Citizen Congress Act - Makes Members of Congress (Members) ineligible to participate in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) except as otherwise provided under this Act. Allows Members to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan during the 12-year period beginning on the date the Member begins his or her first term. Permits refunds to be made in accordance with otherwise applicable law on account of an individual becoming ineligible to participate in CSRS or FERS as a result of this Act's enactment (provides that, for purposes of any such refund, a Member who becomes ineligible to participate in either of the retirement systems shall be treated as if separated from service). Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) annuities; and (2) preservation of rights based on prior service. (Sec. 3) Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1965 to provide for the disclosure of information necessary to enable the public to accurately compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member based on various assumptions of years of service and age of separation from service by reason of retirement. (Sec. 4) Eliminates for Members automatic: (1) annuity cost-of-living adjustments; and (2) pay adjustments under the legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. (Sec. 6) Requires a roll call vote for any matter relating to congressional pay. (Sec. 7) Permits any travel award that accrues by reason of official travel of a House Member, officer, or employee to be used only for official travel. (Sec. 8) Expresses the intent of the Congress that a Member or Member-elect may not mail any mass mailing as franked mail. (Sec. 9) Prohibits a Member from receiving transportation in an aircraft of the Military Air Command unless: (1) the transportation is provided on a space-available basis as part of the aircraft's scheduled operations; (2) the use of the aircraft is necessary because the Member's destination or an airfield located within reasonable distance thereof is inaccessible by regularly scheduled flights of commercial aircraft; or (3) such use is the least expensive method for the Member to reach the destination by aircraft. (Sec. 10) Bars a Member from receiving medical or dental care in a facility of any uniformed service unless: (1) such Member is eligible or entitled to such care as a member or former member of a uniformed service or as a covered beneficiary; or (2) such care is provided on an emergency basis unrelated to the person's status as a Member. (Sec. 11) Prohibits the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority from providing reserved parking areas free of charge to Members, other Government officials, or diplomats at Washington National Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport. Directs such Authority to establish a parking policy for such airports that provides equal access to the public and does not provide preferential parking privileges to such individuals."
