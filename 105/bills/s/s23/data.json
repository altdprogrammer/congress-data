Requires agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, to purchase recycled products from businesses located in such zones.

Title III: Community-Based Housing Development - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to study and report to the Comptroller General on the feasibility of consolidating existing public and low-income housing programs into a comprehensive block grant system of Federal aid and on the possibility of administering future programs through such a system. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress with an analysis of such report and recommendations. (Sec. 302) Provides, subject to the approval of both the unit of general local government and the local public housing agency, for the reconstruction of public housing dwelling units on the same property on which such units were demolished or disposed, and for the relocation of displaced tenants to such new units. Title IV: Response to Urban Environmental Challenges -Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to prohibit the President or any other person from bringing an enforcement action under such Act, with respect to a facility located in an urban area that is not listed on the National Priorities List, against a person that has fulfilled all requirements under State and local law to conduct environmental response actions at such facility. (Sec. 402) Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to maintain the brownfield program (a program for the expansion or redevelopment of abandoned or underused commercial or industrial property at which a hazardous substance may be present) established by the Administrator before the enactment of this section. Limits to $200,000 the maximum grant to any single brownfield facility. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1998 through 2000 out of the Hazardous Substance Superfund."
