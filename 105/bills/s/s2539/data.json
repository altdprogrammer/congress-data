    "text": "National Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 1998 - Authorizes the oilheat industry to conduct a referendum through a qualified industry organization among retailers and wholesalers for the creation of a National Oilheat Research Alliance to develop programs concerning oilheat research and development, safety issues, consumer education, and training. Defines industry to include those persons involved in the production, transportation, and sale of oilheat, and those engaged in the manufacture and distribution of oilheat utilization equipment in the United States (but not the ultimate consumers of oilheat). Permits State industry trade association participation in such Alliance. Prescribes guidelines for Alliance membership and representation. Requires the Alliance to: (1) levy and collect annual assessments on the wholesale sale of No. 1 distillate and No. 2 dyed distillate sufficient to cover Alliance plans and program costs; and (2) establish a program coordinating its operation with that of any similar State, local, or regional program. Prescribes allocation guidelines governing Alliance funds made available to a qualified State association. Conditions fund availability upon the Alliance's determination that the funds will be used to benefit the oilheat industry directly. Empowers the Alliance to bring suit in Federal district court to compel compliance with any assessments it levies. Mandates that Alliance-funded consumer education activities include a statement that they were supported by the Alliance. Prohibits such consumer education activities from including: (1) a reference to a private brand name; (2) a false or unwarranted claim on behalf of oilheat or related products; or (3) a reference regarding the attributes or use of any competing product. Prescribes procedural guidelines for the filing and transmittal of complaints, including judicial review in Federal court."
