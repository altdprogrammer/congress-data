    "text": "Indian Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Improvement Act - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to eliminate the pass-through of Federal assistance to Indian tribes that perform law enforcement functions (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) and that agree to certain requirements applicable to the detention and confinement of juveniles. Requires that, with respect to any cooperative program conducted with an Indian tribe, the participation of the Indian tribe shall be funded from amounts made available under the program established by this Act to provide direct grants to Indian tribes. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, by regulation, to establish a program to provide direct grants to Indian tribes in accordance with this Act. Requires each grant made to an Indian tribe to be used by the governing body of the Indian tribe for: (1) establishing, operating, and evaluating projects for achieving compliance with certain requirements relating to juvenile detention, and otherwise meeting any applicable requirements of this Act; and (2) otherwise conducting activities to promote the improvement of the juvenile justice system of that Indian tribe. Requires an Indian tribe, as part of an application for a grant, to submit a specified plan for conducting activities described in the preceding. Directs the Administrator to: (1) annually award grants on a competitive basis; and (2) enter into a grant agreement with each grant recipient that specifies the terms and conditions of the grant. States that the period of a grant awarded shall be one year. Permits the Administrator, in any case in which the Administrator determines that a grant recipient has performed satisfactorily during the preceding year in accordance with an applicable grant agreement, to: (1) waive the requirement that the recipient be subject to the competitive award process described; and (2) renew the grant for an additional grant period. Makes each Indian tribe that receives a grant subject to a specified reporting requirement. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a program to provide technical assistance to assist Indian tribes in carrying out the activities described; and (2) after the end of the fiscal year during which this Act is enacted, and annually thereafter, issue a report to each advisory group established under a State plan that includes information relating to each grant awarded, including the amount of the grant. Authorizes appropriations."
