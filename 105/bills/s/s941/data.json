    "text": "Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to specified congressional committees on ferry transportation in the United States and its possessions in order to identify: (1) existing ferry operations; and (2) potential U.S. ferry routes in the United States and its possessions and to develop certain information on them. Directs the Secretary to meet with State and municipal planning organizations to discuss the results of the study and the availability of both Federal and State resources for providing marine ferry service. Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to authorize appropriations for ferry operations providing daily transportation for workers, students, or both who reside on one or more islands in the noncontiguous United States. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans for marine ferry operations in the transportation of passengers or passengers and vehicles in the United States and its possessions. Authorizes appropriations. Amends Federal shipping law, with regard to the issuance of a certificate of documentation for a small passenger vessel, passenger vessel, or a ferry, to declare that the members of an association, trust, joint venture, or other entity that owns a vessel that is not registered under the laws of a foreign country or titled in a State do not all have to be U.S. citizens provided the vessel is subject to a charter to a U.S. citizen. Directs the Coast Guard to review the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft to: (1) determine whether its safety regulations are suitable for high-speed vessels not currently regulated; and (2) make recommendations to specified congressional committees. Requires certain manning requirements imposed on a high-speed passenger vessel to consider the specialized nature of the vessel and its navigation, handling, and maintenance functions for protection of life, property, and the environment. Directs the Secretary to prescribe manning standards related to the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew of such vessel operating on the waters of the United States or the waters of an exclusive economic zone. Directs the Transportation Research Board to evaluate and report to specified congressional committees on different technological approaches to the provision of high-speed marine ferry service and potential for U.S. utilization."
