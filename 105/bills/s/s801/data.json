    "text": "Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Discrimination Prevention Act - Establishes in the Department of Veterans Affairs an Office of Employment Discrimination Complaints Resolution headed by a Director who shall be solely responsible for resolving complaints of unlawful employment discrimination (UED) within the Department. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to employ within such Office such administrative law judges (ALJs) and other personnel as necessary. Directs the Secretary to include in Department budget information submitted annually to the Congress specified information on the Office budget and activities. Requires the Director to prescribe: (1) standards of timeliness for the resolution of UED complaints; (2) Office employee qualification and training requirements; (3) requirements for recordkeeping pertaining to counseling and investigations conducted by Office employees; and (4) standards for conduct of UED investigations. Requires such standards to be consistent with those prescribed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, while allowing the Director to shorten the time period for the resolution of complaints. Provides for informal UED complaint resolution procedures within the Office, requiring the Director, if such a complaint is not resolved informally, to assign the complaint to an ALJ for appropriate determination. Requires Office employees to conduct complaint investigations and report results to the Director, who shall then forward such complaint to the presiding ALJ, the complainant, and the Secretary. Requires final complaint resolution by the ALJ when not resolved through informal proceedings. Authorizes the complainant to request a hearing on the matter, to be granted by an ALJ unless there is no dispute as to a material fact. Provides for Commission review of final Office decisions. Applies Federal violation reporting protection provisions (whistleblower provisions) to Department employees or applicants."
