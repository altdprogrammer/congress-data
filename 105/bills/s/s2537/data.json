Requires the Board to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on its actions in obtaining such agreement, including a summary of projects financed by other G-7 projects that do not meet the Bank's environmental policies and procedures. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Board from withholding financing from a project if the government of any G-7 country is providing (or has indicated approval to provide) financing of the project and such financing is not conditioned on meeting the environmental policies and procedures of the Bank."
