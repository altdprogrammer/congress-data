    "text": "Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 - Declares the purposes of this Act to be to: (1) serve as the first authorization in a series of computing, information, and communication technology initiatives outlined in the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (HPCA); and (2) provide for the development and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated U.S. research program on computer network infrastructure, high-speed data access, and networking technology. Directs the Advisory Committee on High-Performance Computing and Communications, Information Technology, and the Next Generation Internet (created under the HPCA) to assess the extent to which: (1) the Next Generation Internet program (program) carries out the purposes of this Act and addresses concerns relating to geographic penalties (costs imposed on Internet users in rural or small population areas that are greater than those imposed on users in large population areas or areas closer to network facilities) and technology transfer to and from the private sector; and (2) the role of each Federal department and agency involved in implementing the program is clear, complementary, and non-duplicative, as well as the extent to which each such department and agency concurs with the role of each other participating department or agency. Requires the Advisory Committee to assess program implementation and report at least annually to the President and specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 and 2000 for the program. Requires the amount authorized for the Department of Defense for FY 1999 to be the amount authorized pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1999. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to request the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study, taking into account the diverse needs of domestic and international Internet users, of the short-term and long-term effects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding new generic top-level domains and related dispute resolution procedures. Sets forth reporting requirements for the Council and the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations."
