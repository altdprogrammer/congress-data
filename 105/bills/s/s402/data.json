Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct all necessary and appropriate investigations, studies, and required Federal actions to implement the Agreement. Provides for consideration by the District to the United States and U.S. responsibilities under such Agreement. Authorizes the Secretary to convey to the District all U.S. rights and interest in District project irrigation works. Provides that the transfer of title shall not affect the timing or obligation amount of the Bonneville Power Administration for the repayment of Federal construction costs that the Secretary has determined to be beyond the ability of irrigators to pay. Directs the Secretary to retain title to the Wildlife Mitigation Facilities. Terminates certain prior contracts upon such conveyance. Continues the District's obligation to deliver water to Indian trust lands upon request. Provides liabilities of the District upon conveyance of the irrigation works. Terminates upon the completion of the transfer specified mandates imposed upon the irrigation works under prior reclamation laws. Deauthorizes upon completion of the transfer the Chief Joseph Dam Project of the Oroville-Tonasket Unit Extension, Washington."
