    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-03-17", 
    "text": "Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit, with exceptions, receipt by owners or operators of landfills or incinerators in a State of out-of-State municipal solid waste without authorization from the affected local government. Sets forth requirements for provision of facility information to the local government by the owner or operator. Exempts from this Act's prohibition operators of landfills or incinerators if: (1) the facility received documented shipments of such waste during the year preceding enactment of this Act in accordance with State law or, before enactment, entered into a host agreement or other legally binding, documented (and publicly available) authorization to receive such waste; (2) in the case of a landfill, the facility is in compliance with Federal and State laws relating to design and location standards, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and post-closure and corrective action; and (3) in the case of an incinerator, the facility is in compliance with Clean Air Act performance standards and State laws relating to facility design. Provides procedures to permit State Governors, if requested by an affected local government, to limit for a one-year period the quantity of out-of-State waste received at excepted landfills to the quantity received during the year preceding enactment of this Act. Allows a State to exercise an option to exempt itself from the requirements of this Act."
