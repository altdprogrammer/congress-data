Title II: Centralized Child Support Enforcement - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) establish an Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement in the Internal Revenue Service to locate absent parents, facilitate enforcement of child support obligations, and establish a Division of Enforcement by October 1, 1997; and (2) promulgate regulations for the coordination of activities among the Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the States.

(Sec. 203) Prescribes Division of Enforcement duties. Authorizes the Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement, through the Division of Enforcement, to assess and collect unpaid arrearages under the same enforcement guidelines as pertain to a tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code whose collection would be jeopardized by delay. Authorizes use of the Federal courts for such enforcement. (Sec. 204) Requires State plans for child and spousal support to provide for State cooperation with the Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Centralized Child Support Enforcement to facilitate information exchange regarding child support cases and the enforcement of orders by the Commissioner.
