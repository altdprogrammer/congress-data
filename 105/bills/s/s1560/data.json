Prohibits their use by a depository institution for purpose of compliance with Federal banking law unless the appropriate Federal banking agency certifies in writing to the Congress that such standards: (1) reflect more accurately depository institution assets, liabilities, and earnings; and (2) will not have the effect of diminishing the use of risk management practices that would have the effect of inhibiting the safe and sound operation of a depository institution."
