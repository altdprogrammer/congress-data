Provides for related caseload and exemption adjustments. (Sec. 1002) Obligates additional FY 1996 through 2002 funds for program employment and training programs.

Subtitle B: Multifamily Housing Reform - Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 - Part 1: FHA-Insured Multifamily Housing Mortgage and Housing Assistance Restructuring - Directs the Secretary (Secretary) of Housing and Urban Development to enter into agreements with participating administrative entities (with preference given to State housing finance agencies) to develop and implement mortgage restructuring and rental assistance plans for FHA-insured multifamily housing mortgages in order to: (1) reduce expiring section 8 contracts costs; (2) address troubled projects; and (3) correct management and ownership deficiencies.

Title III: Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation - Subtitle A: Spectrum Auctions and License Fees - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to revise provisions regarding competitive bidding for use of the electromagnetic spectrum to authorize the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use auctions as a means to assign spectrum. Makes competitive bidding authority inapplicable to licenses or construction permits issued for: (1) public safety services; (2) public telecommunications services when the license application is for channels reserved for noncommercial use; (3) spectrum and associated orbits used within global satellite systems; (4) new digital television (TV) service given to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to replace current licenses; (5) terrestrial radio and TV broadcasting when the FCC determines that an alternative method of resolving mutually exclusive applications serves the public interest better than competitive bidding; or (6) spectrum allocated for specified unlicensed use if competitive bidding would interfere with operation of end-user products. Extends competitive bidding authority through FY 2007. Requires the FCC, by the end of 2001, to assign by competitive bidding 45 megahertz (mhz.) located at 1,710-1,755 mhz. for commercial use. Provides that Federal Government stations assigned to use such band shall retain use until the end of 2003 unless exempted from relocation.

Requires the FCC to attempt to accommodate displaced licensees by relocating them to other frequencies and notify the Secretary whenever unable to provide for effective relocation. Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to require the Secretary of Commerce to make specified recommendations, upon receiving a report from the FCC on inability to accommodate displaced licensees, for purposes of reassigning such licensees to frequencies allocated for Government use. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) the reimbursement of Federal spectrum users for relocation costs; (2) petitions by persons seeking to relocate Federal stations; and (3) Federal rights to reclaim reallocated spectrum. Directs the Secretary to make available for reallocation from Federal frequencies 20 mhz. located below three ghz. (Sec. 3002) Amends the Act to prohibit, under competitive bidding provisions, the renewal of a license authorizing analog TV services beyond the end of 2006. Extends or waives this deadline for a station in any TV market unless 95 percent of the TV households have access to digital local TV signals.
