Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that the Registry develops, evaluates and implements a plan to: (1) effectuate efficiencies in the relationship between the Registry and donor centers; and (2) incorporate the findings and recommendations of the Bone Marrow Program Inspection conducted as of January 1997 by the Office of the Inspector General. Requires the Registry to: (1) implement a bone marrow donors recruitment program to identify populations underrepresented among potential Registry donors; (2) establish an office of patient advocacy, which shall provide individualized case management services directly to the patient; and (3) report annually to the Secretary on pretransplant costs. Directs the Secretary (acting through the Registry) to establish a scientific registry of information relating to recipients of bone marrow transplants from a biologically unrelated donor. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on the Registry, covering specified questions, including the extent to which the Registry has increased the representation of racial and ethnic minority groups among potential donors."
