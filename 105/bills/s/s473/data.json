Considers (in addition) a provider as not an employee if: (1) there is such a written contract; and (2) the provider is a corporation or limited liability company and does not receive benefits that the recipient's employees receive. Regulates the treatment of determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury that a service provider should have been treated as an employee."
