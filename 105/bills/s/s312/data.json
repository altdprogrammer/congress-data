Modifies the boundary of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site to include such land. Requires the Secretary to study and report to specified congressional committees on the area between and surrounding the Site and the Farm in order to: (1) protect the resources of the Farm from incompatible adjacent land uses; and (2) identify significant resources associated with the early boyhood of Abraham Lincoln. Requires the study to: (1) consider whether direct National Park Service management or alternative protection by other agencies or the private sector is appropriate for such area; and (2) identify alternatives which would be most effective and efficient in protecting significant resources and providing for public enjoyment. Authorizes appropriations."
