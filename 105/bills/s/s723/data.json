Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to the Congress on the scope and effect of the importation of foreign-made surplus military firearms, including: (1) a list of types and models of military firearms currently being imported into the United States as \"curios or relics\" which would otherwise be barred; (2) a list of the number of each such type and model that has been imported during the five years preceding the date of submission of the report; (3) a description of the ease with which each such type and model may be converted to a semi-automatic assault weapon or to a fully automatic weapon; (4) statistics that may be relevant to the use of each such type and model for criminal activities; and (5) a comprehensive evaluation of the scope of such importation and the use of such weapons in crimes in the United States."
