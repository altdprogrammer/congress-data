    "text": "Small Business Capital Gains Enhancement Act of 1997 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase from 50 percent to 75 percent the exclusion from gain for a taxpayer, including a corporation, resulting from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock held for more than five years. States that stock held among members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group shall not be eligible for such treatment. Exempts such exclusion from alternative minimum tax provisions. Increases: (1) the qualified small business asset limit from $50 million to $100 million; and (2) the per-issuer limit from $10 million to $20 million. Increases the working capital asset holding period from two years to five years. Provides for the nontaxable rollover of gain from qualified small business stock to another small business stock."
