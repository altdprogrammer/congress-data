Instructs the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the extent of U.S. pension fund assets that represent interests in any foreign person or governmental entity. Directs the Secretaries of State and of the Treasury to: (1) negotiate agreements with U.S. allies to institute in them reporting requirements similar to those imposed by this Act; and (2) report to the Congress on such negotiations."
