(Sec. 4) Provides that INS standardized naturalization examinations shall: (1) have INS-certified proctors; and (2) not be administered by for-profit entities that also provide citizenship courses. Provides for: (1) an initial 24-month pilot testing program; and (2) dissemination of study materials. (Sec. 5) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) develop a plan to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the naturalization process, including a six-month maximum time for completion of such process; and (2) ensure that the naturalization fingerprint submission process deters naturalization fraud by requiring fingerprint cards to be sent directly to INS or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and by procuring the technology to institute INS electronic fingerprint checks. (Sec. 7) Directs INS to ensure that a FBI criminal history background check is completed prior to an applicant's naturalization interview. Requires naturalization applicants to demonstrate basic English language speaking and comprehension abilities at the time of the standardized naturalization examination or interview. Requires INS to ensure that certificates of citizenship are not distributed prior to an applicant's taking the oath of allegiance. (Sec. 8) Obligates specified INS appropriations for backlog reduction and technological and infrastructure changes."
