    "text": "Class Action Fairness Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require that, no later than ten days after a proposed settlement in a class action is filed in court, the attorneys representing the class in a class action serve the attorney general of each State (State AGs) in which a class member resides and the Department of Justice (DOJ) with specified information, including notice of a proposed settlement. Prohibits the holding of a hearing to consider final approval of a proposed settlement earlier than 120 days after the date on which the State AGs and DOJ are served notice. Requires any court with jurisdiction over a plaintiff class action to require that: (1) any written notice provided to the class through the mail or publication in printed media contain a short summary written in plain, easily understood language describing the subject matter of the class action, the legal consequences of joining such action, and, if the notice is informing class members of a proposed settlement agreement, specified information; and (2) any notice provided through television or radio to inform the class of its rights to be excluded from a class action or a proposed settlement describe, in plain, easily understood language, the individuals that may potentially become class members and explain that the failure of individuals falling within the definition of the class to exercise their right to be excluded from a class action will result in the individual's inclusion in such action. Authorizes a class member to refuse to comply with, and choose not to be bound by, a settlement agreement or consent decree in a class action lawsuit if the class member resides in a State where the State AG has not provided notice and materials under this Act."
