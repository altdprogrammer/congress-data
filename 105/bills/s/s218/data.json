(Sec. 102) Excludes from gross income qualified scholarships and fellowships, including Federal tuition grants requiring future Federal service. (Sec. 103) Makes the employer-provided educational assistance income exclusion permanent. Repeals a limitation on graduate-level educational assistance. Subtitle B: Encouraging Savings for Higher Education Costs - Permits the use without penalty of distributions from certain retirement and pension plans to pay higher education expenses. (Sec. 112) Allows a deduction of up to $2,000 per calendar year for contributions to a tax-exempt education savings account for a beneficiary under age 19. Permits non-deductible contributions to such an account as well. Prescribes penalties for the use of distributions for other than qualified educational expenses. (Sec. 113) Increases from $40, 000 ($60,000 for a joint return) to $70,000 ($100,000 for a joint return) the income limits for full exclusion from gross income of any income from U.S. savings bonds used to higher education tuition and fees. Title II: Scholarships for Academic Achievement - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award $1,000 scholarships to secondary school students graduating in the top five percent of their class, subject to family income limits. Allows such students to receive a maximum of two such scholarships for use at any institution of higher education during any four academic years. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Deficit Neutrality - Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) this Act will be deficit neutral; and (2) its costs should be paid by closing corporate loopholes."
