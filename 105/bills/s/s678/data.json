    "text": "Federal Judgeship Act of 1997 - Directs the President to make appointments to specified additional permanent and temporary judgeships in various U.S. circuit courts of appeal and district courts. Includes the Northern Mariana Islands within the ninth judicial circuit. Establishes a judicial district for the Northern Mariana Islands, with court to be held at Saipan. Provides for the appointment of one district judge, who shall also serve as a bankruptcy judge, for the Northern Mariana Islands. Authorizes the Chief Judge of the ninth circuit to assign judges of courts of record of the Northern Mariana Islands or Guam, including a judge of the District Court of Guam who is appointed by the President or a recalled senior judge of such court, to serve temporarily as a judge in the United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands when necessary. Grants such designated judges the powers of a magistrate judge. Repeals provisions: (1) authorizing the judges of the District Court of the Northern Mariana Islands to be summoned to judicial conferences; (2) directing that such a judge who retires from office after meeting specified age and service requirements receive an annuity equal to the salary received at the time of retirement during the remainder of the judge's lifetime; and (3) granting the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from an interlocutory order of the District Court of the Northern Mariana Islands. Modifies the definition of: (1) \"judicial official\" under provisions concerning annuities for survivors of certain judicial officials of the United States to exclude a judge of the District Court of the Northern Mariana Islands; (2) \"States\" to include the Northern Mariana Islands within such definition for purposes of diversity jurisdiction; and (3) \"felony\" to cover specified offenses (under provisions regarding civil commitment and rehabilitation of narcotics addicts) in violation of Northern Mariana Islands law. Permits any U.S. attorney appointed for the Northern Mariana Islands to serve at the same time as U.S. attorney in another judicial district. Allows individuals from the Northern Mariana Islands to serve as magistrates. Authorizes appropriations."
