    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Assistance for Children Title II: Parent Grants Enhancing Family Life Act of 1998 - Title I: Assistance for Children - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to entitle States and Indian tribes to funds to establish second chance homes for custodial parents under age 19 and their children. Defines a second chance home as one with a supportive and supervised living arrangement in which such parents would be required to learn parenting skills, including child development, family budgeting, health and nutrition, and other skills to promote their long-term economic independence and the well-being of their children. Specifies funds for such program. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit recommendations to the Congress on the extent to which surplus Federal properties may be used for such homes. (Sec. 102) Amends SSA title IV (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) (TANF) to revise eligibility criteria for children with special needs with respect to the adoption assistance program. Prohibits adoption assistance payments to parents of any child with special needs who is not a U.S. citizen or resident, and was adopted outside the United States or was brought into the United States in order to be adopted. Allows such payments for such a child placed in foster care subsequent to the failure of the initial adoption by such parents. Requires a State to spend, for specified services (including post-adoption services) to children or families, an amount equal to the amount of any savings in State expenditures resulting from the application of revised eligibility criteria for children with special needs. Instructs the Secretary to approve at least three child welfare demonstration projects designed to test a per capita approach for the successful resolution of a foster care placement under which a private entity contracts to either restore a child in foster care to the child's parents or locate an adoptive placement. (Sec. 103) Amends SSA title IV to create part F (Assistance for Young Children) to establish a statutory mechanism for the Secretary to make allotments to eligible States to pay for the Federal share of the cost of State grants to local collaboratives for young child assistance activities. Requires a State to establish a State Early Learning Coordinating Board to receive the Federal allotment and make the grants. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Parent Grants - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make payments to enable a qualifying institution of higher education to make grants to certain custodial parents of a child under the age of six for career development and retraining after a period of child rearing. Authorizes appropriations."
