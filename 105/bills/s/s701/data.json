    "text": "Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans, among other things, to: (1) assure Medicare enrollees timely access to in-network primary and specialty health care providers, with access to specialized treatment when medically necessary, and, under certain conditions, access to out-of-network providers as well; (2) establish a grievance process for resolving grievances between them and their enrollees; and (3) provide each enrollee with an explanation of the enrollee's rights and a copy of the most recent comparative report on the plans offered by the eligible organization in which the enrollee is enrolled or is eligible to enroll. Prohibits health care provider incentive plans that fail to meet specified criteria. Bans interference with certain medical communications. Applies generally the same requirements to Medicare select policies. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a thorough study for the Congress regarding the implementation of the amendments made above by this Act, together with recommendations for such legislation and administrative actions as the Secretary considers appropriate. Directs the Secretary to establish a clearinghouse and, if appropriate, a toll-free telephone hotline to provide for dissemination of the comparative reports."
