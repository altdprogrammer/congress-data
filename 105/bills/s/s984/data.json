    "text": "United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act - Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to accord, for a specified transition period, the same tariff and quota treatment (lower tariffs or duty-free treatment) given certain textile and apparel articles imported from North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries to such articles from U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act (CBTEA) beneficiary countries planning to become parties to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or countries which have undertaken their obligations under the World Trade Organization on or ahead of schedule. Authorizes any interested U.S. person during such transition period to request the President to proclaim lower tariff and quota treatment with respect to certain nonoriginating CBTEA textile and apparel articles. Directs the President to report periodically to the Congress concerning CBTEA beneficiary countries. Directs the United States International Trade Commission to report biennially to the Congress and the President on the economic impact of this Act on U.S. industries and consumers, including its effectiveness in promoting drug-related crop eradication and crop substitution efforts of the CBTEA beneficiary countries. Authorizes the President to determine that a country is not providing adequate protection of intellectual property rights under its laws, even if it is in compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act."
