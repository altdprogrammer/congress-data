(Sec. 5) Urges the President to instruct: (1) the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) to introduce a resolution in the UN Security Council calling upon the Cuban government to immediately respect all human rights, free all political prisoners, legalize independent political parties, allow independent trade unions, and conduct internationally monitored and freely contested elections; and (2) the Attorney General to seek an indictment of Fidel Castro and-or other Cuban government officials for the willful, premeditated attack on and destruction of two unarmed \"Brothers to the Rescue\" humanitarian aircraft on February 24, 1996 within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, and the violence against and incapacitation and murder of four individuals on such aircraft, Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Armando Alejandre. Requires specified reports on Cuba. (Sec. 6) Earmarks specified amounts of economic support fund and development assistance funds for individuals and independent nongovernmental organizations to support democracy-building efforts, and to provide humanitarian assistance to victims of political repression, in Cuba. Requires notification of the appropriate congressional committees with respect to such funds. Prohibits the provision of assistance under this Act to the Cuban government, to any organization affiliated with the Cuban government, or to any organization that has violated any U.S. law prohibiting or restricting trade or other financial transactions with Cuba. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the President to authorize air transportation flights directly from the United States to Cuba for a period of six months (including additional six month periods) only if the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) those flights are necessary for, and will be used solely for, the delivery of humanitarian assistance (including medicines and medical supplies) by independent nongovernmental organizations to victims of political repression in Cuba; and (2) adequate monitoring is in place to ensure that such assistance will be delivered by such organizations only to the intended recipients and will not be diverted to ineligible persons."
