Applies to any State so added, not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act, any control measure adopted under the ozone transport regions provisions. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions in any State added under this Act to one-third of 1990 levels by the year 2003."
