Requires such amounts to be expended so as to not adversely affect military readiness and the quality of life of military personnel, military retirees, and their families. Prohibits amounts expended for readiness, or for peacekeeping operations that began before September 30, 1998, from being considered emergency expenditures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), with an exception for any such operation that significantly increases in force size or tempo after such date."
