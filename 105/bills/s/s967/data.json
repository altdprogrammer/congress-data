    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1997-10-29", 
    "text": "Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) to include lands conveyed to a Native Corporation pursuant to an exchange authorized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) or other applicable law among lands that are exempt, as long as such lands are not developed, leased, or sold to third parties, from adverse possession claims, real property taxes, specified judgments, and involuntary distributions or conveyances related to the involuntary dissolution of a Native Corporation or Settlement Trust. Specifies that lands shall not be considered developed, leased, or sold to a third party as a result of an exchange or conveyance between or among Native Corporations and trusts, partnerships, corporations, or joint ventures (trusts) whose beneficiaries, partners, shareholders, or joint venturers (beneficiaries) are Native Corporations. Makes certain prohibitions regarding actions by a trustee inapplicable to actions by any trustee whose right, title, or interest in land arises pursuant to an agreement between or among Native Corporations and trusts whose beneficiaries are Native Corporations. (Sec. 2) Amends ANCSA to authorize a Native Regional Corporation, Doyon Limited, upon request, to obtain the retained mineral estate of the Native Allotments that are totally surrounded by ANCSA land selections. Limits the Regional Corporation, to a total of not more than 12,000 acres. Prohibits selection by the Regional Corporation of in lieu surface acres pursuant to an election from being made from any lands within a conservation system unit. (Sec. 3) Amends ANCSA to exempt certain bonds received by a household, an individual Native, or a descendant of a Native from a Native Corporation from being taken into account as an asset or resource in determining eligibility for need-based Federal programs. (Sec. 4) Amends the Alaska Land Status Technical Corrections Act of 1992 to treat the establishment of the Gold Creek account and conveyance of land, if any, as though 3,520 acres of land had been conveyed to Gold Creek Susitna Association, Incorporated, under ANCSA for which rights to in-lieu subsurface estate are provided to Cook Inlet Region Incorporated (CIRI). Requires, within one year from enactment, that CIRI select 3,520 acres of land from the area designated for in-lieu selection by a specified document. (Sec. 5) Amends the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1992 with respect to the implementation, valuation, and administration of the Calista Corporation land exchanges. Extends the restriction on certain property transfers. (Sec. 6) Amends ANCSA to include the Haida Corporation and the Haida Traditional Use Sites with respect to transferring the administration of mining claims on Regional Corporation lands and not subjecting any revenues remitted to Haida Corporation to distribution under such Act. (Sec. 7) Amends ANCSA to exempt revenues received by a Regional Corporation from the sale of sand, gravel, stone, pumice, peat, clay, or cinder resources from the revenue sharing requirements otherwise applicable to revenues received for timber resource and subsurface estate sales. (Sec. 8) Sets forth provisions for the establishment of additional Native urban and group corporations in Southeast Alaska. Requires a report regarding lands and other appropriate compensation for the newly established corporations. Authorizes appropriations for planning grants to the newly established Native Corporations. (Sec. 9) Amends ANILCA to: (1) provide for the approval of certain protested Alaska Native allotment applications (requires any such application which is legislatively approved by enactment to, when allotted, be subject to any easement, trail or right-of-way in existence on the date of the native allotment applicant's actual commencement of use and occupancy.); (2) require the Secretary of the Interior, in selecting individuals to provide certain visitor services, to give preference to the Native Corporations (currently, the Native Corporation) most directly affected by the establishment or expansion of any conservation system unit by or under the provisions of such Act; (3) require all current and future federal land managers in Alaska or a region that includes Alaska, to participate in an ANILCA and ANCSA training class; and (4) permit subsistence uses of fish by local residents in the Glacier Bay National Park where such uses are traditional. (Sec. 13) Revises with respect to public lands in Alaska: (1) access rights provisions; and (2) cabin use provisions; and (3) requirements for allowed uses. (Sec. 15) Requires a report to the Congress concerning local hires under ANILCA and their inability to obtain competitive service positions."
