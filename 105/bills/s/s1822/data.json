Requires participating employees to be employed for at least two years and to demonstrate financial need. Requires scholarship priority to be given to: (1) applicants pursuing a field relating to the provision of primary health care services; and (2) applicants employed at Department health-care facilities in rural areas or at which there is an inadequate supply of qualified health-care personnel. Requires an agreement between the Secretary and the participant under which the scholarship is provided in return for a commitment to serve as a full-time employee in the Department's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for one year for each year in which the scholarship is provided, but for not less than two years. Prohibits individual scholarship payments from exceeding $10,000 in any one year and from continuing for more than three years. Allows up to a six-year period for part-time students. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) Federal employee status of participants; (2) determination of the service commencement date; and (3) liability for breach of the service agreement. Prohibits the Secretary from furnishing such scholarships after December 31, 2001. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out as part of the EAP a program to be known as the Department of Veterans Affairs Primary Care Workers Education Debt Reduction Program under which financial assistance shall be provided to personnel serving in health-care positions in the VHA to reduce the debt incurred in completing programs of education or training for such service. Directs the Secretary to give priority preference under such Program to: (1) individuals recently appointed in fields relating to primary care health services; (2) individuals recently appointed in fields in which the recruitment or retention of an adequate supply of qualified health-care personnel is difficult; and (3) any other individuals serving in either of such fields. Defines \"recently appointed\" as appointed within six months. Allows such payments only if the individual maintains an acceptable level of performance during the payment period. Provides maximum payment amounts of $6,000, $8,000, and $10,000 for the first, second, and third years, respectively. Prohibits any such payments after December 31, 2001. (Sec. 104) Repeals a provision of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 which prohibits payments of tuition loans on behalf of VHA employees. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to notify Department employees of the benefits available under both the Scholarship and Debt Reduction Programs. Title II: Construction Authorization - Authorizes the Secretary to carry out major medical facility projects in specified amounts at Department facilities in Long Beach, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Lebanon, Pennsylvania; Denver, Colorado; and Auburn and Merced, California. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into leases for medical facilities, in specified amounts, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Daytona Beach, Florida; and Oakland Park, Florida. (Sec. 203) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 for the Construction, Major Projects account, and the Medical Care account, with limitations. (Sec. 204) Increases from $300,000 to $600,000 the maximum annual major medical facility lease payment threshold before such a lease must be specifically authorized by law. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the Department's master plan relating to the use of Department lands at the West Los Angeles Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, California. (Sec. 206) Designates the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, as the H. John Heinz III Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to provide hospital care and outpatient or ambulatory care, and authorizes the Secretary to provide nursing home care, to any veteran who received nasopharyngeal radium irradiation treatments while serving on active duty. Authorizes the Secretary to examine, and include in the Department's Ionizing Radiation Registry Program, any such veteran. (Sec. 302) Extends through December 31, 2004, the eligibility of certain former members of the Selected Reserve for veterans' housing loans. (Sec. 303) Extends through September 30, 2003, the Secretary's authority to retain, rather than remit to the Treasury, benefits formerly received by pension-eligible veterans receiving Department nursing home care. (Sec. 304) Directs the Secretary to report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives not later than December 1 of 1999 through 2001 on the provision of competitive pay for Department registered nurses and certain other health care professionals."
