Title II: Related Agencies - Makes appropriations for FY 1998 for: (1) the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board; and (2) the National Transportation Safety Board. Title III: General Provisions - Sets forth specified prohibitions, limitations, permissions, and mandates with respect to the use of appropriations under this Act identical or very similar to those enacted in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997. (Sec. 316) Defines capital project for formula grant purposes. (Sec. 326) Prohibits expenditure of funds made available under this Act by any entity that does not agree to comply with the Buy American Act. Expresses the sense of Congress that entities receiving assistance under this Act should purchase only U.S.-made equipment and products to the greatest extent practicable. Prohibits the use of funds for contracts with persons falsely labeling products as made in America. (Sec. 327) Makes receipts collected from users of fitness centers operated by or for the Department of Transportation available to support their operation and maintenance. (Sec. 331) Prohibits the provision of essential air service to communities in the 48 contiguous States that are fewer than 70 miles from the nearest large and medium hub airport, or that require a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of $200 unless such point is greater than 210 miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport. (Sec. 332) Authorizes the City of Dallas, Texas, to prohibit certain flights using reconfigured aircraft from operating from Love Field, Texas, to a destination in a State that is not contiguous to the State of Texas. Defines reconfigured aircraft as one that originally contained more than 56 seats which has been changed to seat 56 or fewer passengers in order to meet the capacity requirement for a specified exception to the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979. (Sec. 334) Directs the Department of the Navy to transfer the inactive USNS EDENTON (ATS-1) to the U.S. Coast Guard. (Sec. 335) Declares that monies paid by diversion from airport revenues for claims related to ceded lands owned by native Americans, native Hawaiians, or Alaskan natives shall not be subject to repayment. Prohibits further payment of such claims from airport revenues. (Sec. 336) Requires, in order for the Coast Guard to use certain funds to issue or enforce certain regulations under the Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act, that such regulations recognize and provide, with respect to fats, oils, and greases, for differences in physical, chemical, biological, and other relevant properties, and in environmental effects. (Sec. 338) Authorizes the FAA to grant the requests of Kansas City, Missouri, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, to close Richards-Gebaur and Bader Field airports, respectively, with respect to their redevelopment for non-aeronautical uses, unless such closure would adversely affect aviation safety."
