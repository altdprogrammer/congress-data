Increases from $3 million to $6 million per fiscal year the authorized costs for such measures. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire land along River segments administered as recreational rivers. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake River erosion control measures on behalf of a non-Federal entity if such entity agrees to contribute 35 percent of the costs."
