(Sec. 204) Subjects NSF temporary employees to the same financial disclosure requirements as apply to permanent employees. (Sec. 205) Prohibits the use of any funds authorized under this Act from being used for any lobbying activity, except that the prohibition shall not prevent officers or employees of the Federal Government or of its departments or agencies, from communicating to: (1) Members of Congress on the request of any Member; or (2) to the Congress, through the appropriate procedures, requests for legislation or appropriations which the officers or employees deem necessary for the efficient conduct of the Federal Government.
