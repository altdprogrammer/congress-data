    "text": "Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act - Amends the Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (the Covenant Act) to direct the Attorney General to determine minimum standards to ensure an effective system of immigration control for the Commonwealth. Directs the Attorney General to make certain findings with respect to the Commonwealth's ability to administer such system consistent with the minimum standards. (Sec. 2) Grants the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit original and exclusive jurisdiction (except for review by the U.S. Supreme Court) over any complaint of the Northern Mariana Islands with respect to the minimum standards or the Attorney General's findings. Declares that the Immigration and Nationality Act shall apply to the Commonwealth if it does not have the institutional capability to meet the minimum standards or has not demonstrated a genuine commitment to enforce an effective system of immigration control. Applies the Immigration and Nationality Act to the Commonwealth over a ten-year transition period during which the Attorney General shall implement an immigration transition program for it. States that the transition program shall provide for the issuance of nonimmigrant temporary alien worker visas, as well as family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant visas. Sets forth a statutory scheme for: (1) temporary alien workers; (2) immigrants; (3) adequate employment in the Commonwealth's hotel industry after the transition period ends; (4) investor visas; (5) lawful entry under Commonwealth immigration laws; and (6) travel restrictions for certain asylum applicants. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and of Labor to develop a technical assistance program to aid employers in securing employees from among U.S. labor or lawfully admissible freely associated state citizen labor. Authorizes the Attorney General and the Department of Labor to establish Immigration and Naturalization Service, Executive Office of Immigration Review, and Department of Labor operations in the Commonwealth. Directs the President to report to certain congressional committees an evaluation of the overall effect of the transition program and the Immigration and Nationality Act upon the Commonwealth. Prohibits the Commonwealth from permitting an increase in the total number of temporary alien workers present on the Islands during the period between enactment of this Act and either: (1) the date that the Attorney General finds that the Government of the Commonwealth possesses the institutional capability and genuine commitment to enforce an effective system of immigration control; or (2), if the Attorney General finds that it fails to meet such conditions, the effective date of the transition program. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 3) Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to bring the Commonwealth under the jurisdiction of a special industry committee that recommends minimum rate or rates of wages to be paid to Northern Mariana Island employees. Declares that the minimum wage rate established by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the committee's recommendations shall not exceed the minimum wage rate of $5.15 per hour for such employees, except that such rate shall not be raised more than 50 cents per year."
