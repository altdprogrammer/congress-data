Requires that the study: (1) assess the significance of the ranching use and pastoral character of the land, including its significance to the purposes for which the Park was established; (2) identify any need and practicable means for preservation of the land that is necessary to protect that use and character; (3) recommend a variety of economically feasible and viable tools and techniques to retain the pastoral qualities of the area; and (4) estimate the costs of implementing preservation recommendations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) reinstate and extend for the duration of such study and until six months after its recommendations are submitted to the Congress certain expired grazing privileges in and adjacent to the Park; and (2) cancel the extension with respect to any portion of the land that is disposed of in a manner that would result in it no longer being used for ranching or other agricultural purposes."
