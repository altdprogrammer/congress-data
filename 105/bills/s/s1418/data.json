Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) award program grants or contracts to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, universities and industrial enterprises; and (2) establish a panel to provide advice on applications of methane hydrate and priorities for the program. Limits to five percent the amount of program funding that can be used for adminstrative expense and prohibits funding for building construction. Requires the Secretary, in awarding such grants or contracts or entering into such cooperative agreements, to: (1) facilitate and develop partnerships among government, industry, and academia; (2) undertake programs to develop basic information necessary for promoting long-term interest in methane hydrate resources as an energy source; (3) ensure that the data and information developed through the program are accessible and widely disseminated; (4) promote cooperation among agencies that are developing technologies that may hold promise for methane hydrate resource development; and (5) report annually to the Congress on accomplishments. Amends the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 to: (1) define \"methane hydrate\"; and (2) redefine \"marine mineral resource\" to include methane hydrate. Authorizes appropriations."
