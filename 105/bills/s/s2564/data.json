Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Mandates a payment of $100,000 from the Fund to any individual who has a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection if the individual: (1) has a blood-clotting disorder (such as hemophilia) and was treated with blood-clotting agents between July 1, 1982, and December 31, 1987; (2) was treated with HIV-contaminated blood components or HIV-contaminated human tissue between January 1, 1982, and March 31, 1985; (3) is the lawful current or former spouse of such individual and was the lawful spouse of the individual at any time after a date within such period on which the individual was treated; or (4) acquired the HIV infection through perinatal transmission from a parent who is such an individual. Declares that this Act does not create or admit any claim against the United States relating to HIV infection, but makes an accepted payment full satisfaction of all such claims by that individual. Title II: Treatment of Certain Private Settlement Payments in Hemophilia-Clotting-Factor Suit under the SSI Programs - Prohibits a settlement payment in a specified class action lawsuit, payments related to a release of claims regarding that suit, or a payment under title I of this Act from being considered income or resources in determining a class member's eligibility for, or the amount of medical assistance under the Medicaid program or benefits under, the Supplemental Security Income program (titles XIX and XVI of the Social Security Act)."
