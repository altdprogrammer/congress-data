Sets forth admissions requirements, including a maximum three-year stay. Limits: (1) eligible hospitals; (2) fiscal year entrants; and (3) the number of entrants permitted to work in any one State. Requires the Secretary of Labor to compile a public list of facilities petitioning for the admission of each such nurse. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to jointly submit recommendations for an alternative solution to using foreign nurses to resolve the U.S. nursing shortage."
