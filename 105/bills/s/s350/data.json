Defines a qualified surviving spouse as one who has not remarried and is not entitled to an income supplement available to certain widows of retired military personnel. Sets the annuity amount at $165 monthly, reduced by the amount of any monthly dependency and indemnity compensation to which the surviving spouse is entitled. Terminates on September 30, 2001, the authority to pay such annuities."
