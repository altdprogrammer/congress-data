Requires: (1) any order of a U.S. district court disposing of a claim asserting executive privilege in any such investigation to be reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme Court; (2) any such appeal to be taken by a notice of appeal filed within ten calendar days after such order is entered; and (3) the jurisdictional statement to be filed within 30 calendar days after such order is entered. Prohibits issuance of a stay of such an order by a single Supreme Court Justice."
