    "text": "Grand Staircase-Escalante Resource Protection Act - Requires the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah to be managed by the Secretary of the Interior as a special management area. Requires the Secretary to: (1) manage the resources within the Monument in accordance with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield (including recreation, range, timber, minerals, oil and gas, watershed, wildlife, fish, and natural scenic, scientific, and historical values), using principles of economic and ecologic sustainability; (2) provide for protection, interpretation, and responsible use of Monument resources; (3) manage such resources in a way that provides for economic sustainability of local communities; and (4) delegate authority to manage the Monument to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Makes the BLM the lead agency in all management decisions concerning the Monument. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to: (1) recognize and give due deference to the exercise of any valid existing right, lease, permit, or authorization under any law with respect to the designation of the Monument; and (2) provide compensation for any such right determined to be taken as a result of the designation. Requires the Secretary to permit routine maintenance and improvement of roads and rights-of-way within Monument boundaries to ensure public safety and a high-quality visitor experience. (Sec. 6) Provides that grazing of livestock within the Monument shall continue and not be curtailed by reason of designation of the Monument. Sets forth provisions governing water rights. (Sec. 9) Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit a management plan to the Congress for the Monument by September 18, 1999; and (2) in the development and revision of such plan, use principles of multiple use and sustained yield and a systematic interdisciplinary approach to achieve integrated consideration of physical, biological, economic, and other sciences. Authorizes development and utilization of Monument resources if: (1) the President or the Congress determines it to be in the interests of the United States; or (2) in case of a national emergency. Requires the Secretary to modify any existing guidelines regarding management of the Monument to conform to the requirements of this Act. (Sec. 11) Requires the Secretary to provide necessary resources to expedite all exchanges of school trust lands within the Monument when sought by the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration of Utah. Provides for valuation of school trust land sections. Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit an analysis to the Congress of the loss of Federal royalties that can be expected to result from designation of the Monument, based on research compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey; and (2) allow access to school trust lands within the Monument by Utah agencies. (Sec. 12) Establishes the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Advisory Committee to: (1) advise the Secretary, the Director, and the Governor of Utah concerning the development, management, and interpretation of Monument resources and the development, exchange, or disposal of State school trust lands. (Sec. 13) Requires the Secretary to include on the Monument planning team at least five persons, appointed by the Governor, to represent Utah and local governments. (Sec. 14) Authorizes appropriations."
