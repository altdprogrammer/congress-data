    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-01-21", 
    "text": "Government Reform Act - Makes Members of Congress (Members) ineligible to participate in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) except as otherwise provided under this Act. Allows Members to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan at any time during the 12-year period beginning on the date the Member begins his or her first term. Permits refunds to be made in accordance with otherwise applicable law on account of an individual becoming ineligible to participate in CSRS or FERS as a result of this Act's enactment (provides that, for purposes of any such refund, a Member who becomes ineligible to participate in either of the retirement systems shall be treated as if separated from service). Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) annuities; and (2) preservation of rights based on prior service. (Sec. 3) Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1965 to provide for the disclosure of information necessary to enable the public to accurately compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member based on various assumptions of years of service and age of separation from service by reason of retirement. (Sec. 4) Eliminates for Members automatic: (1) annuity cost-of-living adjustments; and (2) pay adjustments under the legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. (Sec. 6) Requires a roll call vote for any matter relating to congressional pay. (Sec. 7) Expresses the intent of the Congress that a Member or Member-elect may not mail any mass mailing as franked mail. (Sec. 8) Prohibits a Member from receiving transportation in an aircraft of the Military Air Command unless: (1) the transportation is provided on a space-available basis as part of the aircraft's scheduled operations; (2) the use of the aircraft is necessary because the Member's destination or an airfield located within reasonable distance thereof is inaccessible by regularly scheduled flights of commercial aircraft; or (3) such use is the least expensive method for the Member to reach the destination by aircraft. (Sec. 9) Bars a Member from receiving medical or dental care in a facility of any uniformed service unless: (1) such Member is eligible or entitled to such care as a member or former member of a uniformed service or as a covered beneficiary; or (2) such care is provided on an emergency basis unrelated to the person's status as a Member. (Sec. 10) Prohibits the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority from providing reserved parking areas free of charge to Members, other Government officials, or diplomats at Washington National Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport. Directs such Authority to establish a parking policy for such airports that provides equal access to the public and does not provide preferential parking privileges to such individuals. (Sec. 11) Requires all costs to equip, operate, and maintain physical fitness facilities for use by Federal employees to be fully paid by the users of such facilities. Prohibits: (1) appropriated funds made available to executive agencies from being expended for fees for the use of the facilities; and (2) such agencies from granting administrative leave to Federal employees for physical fitness activities. Provides an exception for employees in positions which require them to meet physical fitness standards as a condition of employment. (Sec. 12) Prohibits the expenditure of agency funds to equip, operate, or maintain any federally-owned or operated golf course. Requires such golf courses to be operated by concessionaire contracts and open to use by the general public. Makes exceptions for: (1) golf courses located in remote or isolated areas or those for the use of patients or residents at veterans' hospitals, the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home, or the National Institutes of Health; or (2) funds made available from gift funds or representation funds for activities authorized under law. Permits the contracting military base to retain no more than ten percent of the gross revenues generated from any golf course operated by a concessionaire contract to support morale, welfare, or recreational purposes of the base's personnel. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to: (1) subsidize the golf fees for active and retired enlisted personnel utilizing such contracted courses; and (2) give priority access for military personnel. (Sec. 13) Prohibits the expenditure of agency funds to subsidize the costs to equip, operate, or maintain dining rooms or kitchen facilities for the exclusive use of senior Government officers or to purchase or prepare food for consumption by them. Makes exceptions for dining rooms, facilities, or food for: (1) the exclusive use or consumption of the President or his immediate family; or (2) use to carry out the President's official representational functions or for those official activities conducted by executive branch departments or agencies for which representation funds have been authorized and appropriated. (Sec. 14) Prohibits funds appropriated or otherwise made available to agencies or the Congress from being expended to acquire luxury vehicles or to employ drivers for the purpose of transporting senior Government officers, except for: (1) a Government officer as authorized under Federal law regarding passenger carrier use; (2) a Government officer who holds the office of Assistant Secretary or higher; (3) the head of any executive agency and the second highest ranking officer in such agency; (4) officials commissioned by the President or paid at a rate of pay equal to or greater than the rate payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule in the Executive Office of the President; or (5) Members of Congress serving in leadership positions (including any former President pro tempore of the Senate) or elected or appointed officers of the Congress. Requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to prescribe regulations and uniform guidelines for all executive agencies for the purchase or lease of luxury vehicles that shall ensure the least cost to the Government. Requires GSA to report to the Congress annually on: (1) executive agency compliance with such regulations; (2) the number, type, cost, and purpose of vehicles purchased or leased by each executive agency; and (3) the Federal officers and employees who used such vehicles. Requires each legislative branch agency (including each congressional office and committee) to submit comparable reports to the agency's appropriate administrative offices."
