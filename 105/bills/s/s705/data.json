Requires licensees of: (1) the four largest commercial broadcast networks serving the ten largest broadcast markets to provide digital VPS no later than May 1, 1999; and (2) all other licensees in the ten largest broadcast markets and licensees of the four largest commercial networks serving the 11th through 30th markets to provide digital VPS no later than November 1, 1999. Requires the return to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the analog spectrum assigned to television stations providing digital VPS no later than: (1) January 1, 2006, for commercial stations; and (2) January 1, 2007, for noncommercial stations. Authorizes the FCC, under specified circumstances, to grant extensions of the time required for the provision of digital VPS, but not beyond January 1, 2007."
