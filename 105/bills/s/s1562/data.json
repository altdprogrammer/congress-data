    "text": "Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998 - Authorizes a land exchange (for inclusion in the Gallatin National Forest) between the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior and the Big Sky Lumber Company (BSL). Provides that if BSL offers fee title to specified land that is acceptable to the United States, the Secretary of: (1) Agriculture shall accept a warranty deed to the land, convey to BSL (subject to specified limitations) fee title to up to 25,000 acres of National Forest System land, grant to BSL timber harvest rights to up to 50 million board feet of timber, and (subject to availability of funds) purchase land belonging to BSL in the Taylor Fork area at a purchase price of up to $6.5 million; and (2) the Interior shall convey fee title to approximately 1,860 acres of Bureau of Land Management land. Requires that the property and other assets exchanged by BSL and the United States be approximately equal in value, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare, grant to BSL, and administer specified timber harvest rights over a period of five consecutive years. Specifies that timber harvest volume shall constitute the timber sale program for the Gallatin National Forest for that five-year period. Directs such Secretary, if exceptional circumstances prevent the Secretary from conveying such rights, to replace the value of the diminished harvest rights by substituting equivalent timber harvest rights volume from the same market area, conveying national forest lands containing merchantable timber with such Forest, or making a payment from funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) procedures applicable to all national forest timber harvest rights identified for exchange; (2) the exchange agreement; (3) rights-of-way; (4) quality of title; and (5) timing of implementation of the exchange agreement."
