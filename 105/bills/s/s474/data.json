(Sec. 4) Grants the U.S. district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to institute proceedings under this section, and the district court (upon application of the Attorney General) to enter a restraining order or an injunction or take any other action necessary to prevent a violation if the court determines that there is a substantial probability that such violation has occurred or will occur. Authorizes a State attorney general, or other appropriate State official, to institute proceedings under this section under specified circumstances. Sets forth provisions regarding temporary restraining orders, hearings, and permanent injunctions. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) negotiate with foreign countries to conclude international agreements that would enable the United States to enforce specified provisions of this Act with respect to persons engaging in violations from outside the United States; and (2) report on the progress of such negotiations to specified congressional officials."
