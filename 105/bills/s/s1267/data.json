(Sec. 312) Authorizes Department of Transportation (DOT) officers, employees, or agents, during an inspection, to: (1) open, examine, sample, and analyze the contents of a package marked or otherwise represented as containing a hazardous material, or about which there is an objectively reasonable and articulable belief that the package may contain such material; and (2) prevent the further transportation of any material when there is an objectively reasonable and articulable belief that an imminent hazard may exist, until the material's hazardous qualities have been determined. Requires inspectors to mark a package found to contain hazardous materials, and notify the shipper before the package may continue in transportation. Directs the Secretary to issue or impose immediate restrictions, prohibitions, recalls, or out-of-service orders, without notice or the opportunity for a hearing, that may be necessary to abate an emergency situation.

Authorizes a State to maintain an alternate one-call notification program if it provides protection for public safety, the environment, or excavators that is equivalent to, or greater than, protection under a program that meets the minimum standards of this Act. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study damage prevention practices associated with existing one-call notification systems in order to determine which systems practices appear to be the most effective in preventing damage to underground facilities and in protecting the public, the environment, excavators, and public service disruption. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to assist qualifying States in improving their one-call notification programs. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Motor Carrier Safety - Provides for performance-based grants to States for: (1) improving motor carrier safety; and (2) enforcing regulations for hazardous materials transportation safety.

(Sec. 503) Makes 100 percent the Federal share of public education activities with respect to commercial motor vehicle safety programs and enforcement. (Sec. 504) Authorizes appropriations for commercial motor vehicle safety programs for FY 1998 through 2003. (Sec. 505) Authorizes the Secretary to establish motor carrier information systems and data analysis programs to support motor carrier regulatory and enforcement activities. Requires such information systems, in cooperation with the States, to be coordinated into a network providing identification of motor carriers and drivers, registration and licensing tracking, and motor carrier and driver safety performance. Requires the Secretary to develop and maintain data analysis capacity and programs to provide the means: (1) to develop strategies to address safety problems and to use data analysis to measure the effectiveness of these strategies and related programs; (2) to determine the cost effectiveness of State and Federal safety compliance, enforcement programs, and other countermeasures; (3) to evaluate the safety fitness of motor carriers and drivers; (4) to identify and collect necessary data; and (5) to adapt, improve, and incorporate other information and information systems as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to include, as part of the DOT motor carrier safety information network system, a Performance and Registration Information Systems Management information system to serve as a clearinghouse and repository of information related to State registration and licensing of commercial motor vehicles and the safety system of the commercial motor vehicle registrants or the motor carriers operating the vehicles. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program focusing on improving commercial motor vehicle driver safety. (Sec. 506) Directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program in cooperation with one or more States to: (1) improve upon the timely exchange of pertinent driver performance and safety records data; and (2) determine to what extent such data, including relevant fines, penalties, and failures to appear for a hearing or trial, should be included as part of any information systems under DOT oversight. (Sec. 507) Requires specified allocations of appropriations for each of FY 1998 through 2003 for activities designed to advance commercial motor vehicle and driver safety, with any obligation, contract, cooperative agreement, or support granted in excess of $100,000 to be awarded on a competitive basis.
