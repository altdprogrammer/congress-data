    "text": "Drug Use Prevention Act of 1997 - Amends: (1) the Social Security Act to exclude individuals and entities from participation in Medicare and State health care programs (participation) for administering, dispensing, or recommending the use of marihuana to an individual in violation of Federal or State law; and (2) the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to direct the Attorney General to deny an application for registration, or revoke a registration, of a practitioner to dispense, or conduct research with, controlled substances upon a finding by the Attorney General that the applicant practitioner administered, dispensed, or recommended the use of marihuana to an individual in violation of Federal or State law or that the applicant practitioner has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation for illegally dispensing marihuana. Deems a practitioner to have \"recommended\" the use of marihuana if he or she offered advice, or responded to a request for advice, suggesting the use of marihuana while acting in the course of his or her professional capacity. Amends the CSA to prohibit: (1) an individual from acquiring or obtaining possession of marihuana by means of claiming a medical need, with the intent of selling or distributing the marihuana; and (2) a practitioner from prescribing, dispensing, or recommending the use of marihuana. Directs that, in addition to any other applicable penalty, any practitioner who violates the CSA by prescribing, dispensing, or recommending the use of marihuana to a person under age 21 be sentenced to up to eight years' imprisonment, fined up to $60,000, or both."
