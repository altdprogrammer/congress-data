    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that whoever, while serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces outside of the United States, engages in conduct that would constitute an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if such conduct had occurred within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment. Sets forth provisions regarding concurrent jurisdiction, action by foreign governments, and arrests. Authorizes the delivery to authorities of foreign countries of persons alleged to have engaged in such conduct under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary of the military department having jurisdiction of the armed force of a member, at the time such member is discharged or released, to transmit to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) a copy of records of any penal actions taken against the member under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Requires: (1) any person convicted of a crime of a sexual nature under the Code, prior to military discharge, to transmit to such Secretary a sample of blood, saliva, or other specimen collected from that person necessary to conduct DNA analysis; and (2) each sample to be transmitted in a timely manner to the Director for inclusion in the FBI's Combined DNA Identification System."
