    "text": "Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to prescribe alternative penalty reductions in its Federal payments for a State that would otherwise have its child support data processing system plan disapproved for noncompliance, if it has an approved corrective compliance plan and makes a good faith effort to comply with the requirements for such a system. Instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive the noncompliance penalty during FY 1998 for any State which meets certain criteria. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the single statewide automated data processing and information retrieval system requirement if a State demonstrates that it has or can develop an alternative system or systems that meet specified requirements."
