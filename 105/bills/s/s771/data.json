    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-05-21", 
    "text": "Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Choice Act of 1997 - Requires a person who transmits an electronic mail message as part of the transmission of unsolicited commercial electronic mail to include: (1) the word \"Advertisement\" at the very beginning of such message; and (2) the name, physical address, electronic mail address, and telephone number of the sender prominently displayed within such message. Empowers the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regulatory authority over such unsolicited electronic mail, including authority to conduct investigations, commence civil actions against individuals, and impose fines and penalties. Requires the FTC to take appropriate action within two years after the transmission of such electronic mail. Authorizes a State to bring a civil action on behalf of its residents against individuals or entities transmitting electronic mail in violation of this Act. Requires such State to notify the FTC of such action. States that this Act shall not apply to an electronic mail transmission by an interactive computer service provider unless the provider initiates the transmission. Requires a provider to notify the FTC of any use of its equipment in violation of this Act. Requires each such provider to make available to subscribers a system permitting the subscribers to block the receipt of any electronic mail that contains the term \"advertisement\" in its subject line. Authorizes a person who receives a transmission of unsolicited commercial electronic mail to request, by return electronic mail, the termination of such transmissions. Requires such a request to be complied with within 48 hours after its receipt. States that a person who secures a good or service from, or otherwise responds electronically to, an offer of unsolicited commercial electronic mail shall be deemed to have authorized such transmission without inclusion of the information required of the sender under this Act. Authorizes actions by private persons to enforce the sanctions under this Act. Requires such action within one year after receipt of the transmission."
