    "text": "Children's Environmental Protection Act - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to state U.S. policy regarding the adequacy of protection of vulnerable subpopulations from exposure to environmental pollutants. Defines \"vulnerable subpopulations\" to mean children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, and other subpopulations identified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as likely to experience elevated health risks from environmental pollutants. Directs the Administrator to: (1) consistently and explicitly evaluate environmental health risks to vulnerable subpopulations in all risk assessments and characterizations, environmental or public health standards, or general regulatory decisions; (2) ensure that all EPA standards protect such subpopulations with an adequate margin of safety; (3) develop and use a separate assessment with respect to such subpopulations; and (4) issue revised standards, after reevaluation, that meet the criteria of this Act. Requires a report to the Congress. Directs the Administrator to: (1) identify pollutants commonly used or found in areas reasonably accessible to children (defined as homes, schools, day care centers, shopping malls, movie theaters, and parks); (2) create and review at least annually a list of such substances that are known, likely, or suspected to pose health risks to children and a list of safer-for-children substances and products for use in such areas; (3) establish guidelines to reduce and eliminate exposure to pollutants in such areas, including advice on integrated pest management; (4) create a family right-to-know information kit; (5) make all information described above publicly available; and (6) prohibit the use of any product not on the safer-for-children list in Federal properties and areas. Directs the Administrator and the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services to: (1) coordinate and support the development and implementation of research initiatives to examine the health effects and toxicity of pesticides and other pollutants on vulnerable subpopulations; and (2) report to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
