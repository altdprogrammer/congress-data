Requires the program to include safe alignment and cross-section design, safe roadside conditions, safety appurtenances, durable and safe pavement design, grade crossing safety, and traffic engineering. Requires program cooperation with States and the private sector. Provides for State apportionment of program funds in accordance with a ratio based on the number of qualifying two-lane highway miles in such State and its percentage of rural populations. Requires a report from the Secretary to the Congress on program results. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 through 2003."
