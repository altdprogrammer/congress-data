    "text": "Juvenile Corrections Act of 1997 - Authorizes the Administrator of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to make grants to assist States and local governments in planning, establishing, and operating secure detention and correctional facilities and other facilities and programs for violent juveniles and serious chronic juvenile offenders who are accused of, or who have been adjudicated as having committed, one or more offenses. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) application requirements; (2) minimum amounts allocated to qualifying States; (3) performance evaluations; and (4) technical assistance and training. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to make a compensating reduction of the authorization of appropriations from Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress a report regarding the possible use of performance-based criteria in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of juvenile delinquency programs."
