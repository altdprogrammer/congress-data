    "text": "Fair Pay Act of 1997 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, race, or national origin. (Allows payment of different wages under seniority systems, merit systems, or systems that measure earnings by quantity or quality of production.) Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue guidelines specifying criteria for determining whether a job is dominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or national origin. Prohibits such regulations from including a list of such jobs. Directs courts, in any action brought under this Act for violation of such prohibition, to allow expert fees as part of the costs awarded to prevailing plaintiffs. Allows any such action to be maintained as a class action. Requires employers subject to such prohibition to: (1) preserve records which document and support the method, system, calculations, and other bases used by the employer in establishing, adjusting, and determining the wages paid to their employees, for periods of time prescribed by the EEOC; and (2) make reports to the EEOC. Sets forth certain exemptions for small businesses and provisions for protection of confidentiality with respect to such records. Directs the EEOC to: (1) undertake studies and provide information and technical assistance to employers, labor organizations, and the general public concerning effective means available to implement this Act; (2) carry on a continuing program of research, education, and technical assistance with specified components related to the purposes of this Act; and (3) include a separate evaluation and appraisal regarding the implementation of this Act in its annual report to the Congress. Makes conforming amendments to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 and specified Federal law relating to congressional and executive branch employees."
