    "text": "Freedom to Ship Act of 1997 - Amends Federal shipping law known as the Jones Act to redefine U.S. citizen to include certain corporations, partnerships, trusts, joint ventures, and other business entities organized under U.S. or State law, some (but not all) of whose officers, directors, or partners are U.S. citizens (currently all must be U.S. citizens), even though a parent corporation, partnership, or other second-tier owner, or trust beneficiary, is not a U.S. citizen. Requires such partnerships, trusts, associations, joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships, and other entities to have U.S. citizens as at least two-thirds of their respective general partners, trustees, or members. Allows a coastwise endorsement on the certificate of documentation for certain foreign qualified vessels and vessels of foreign registry (whose nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to U.S. vessels). Renames the requirements for Great Lakes licenses and registry as inland waterways endorsements requirements. Makes conforming amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 and other related Federal law with respect to transportation of merchandise or passengers, towing and salvaging operations, and liability for injury or death of master or crew member. Requires each non-U.S. citizen owner or operator of vessels that regularly engage in the U.S. domestic coastwise trade to: (1) establish a corporation or other corporate entity and qualify under the laws of the State where the corporation or entity is established to do business in the United States; and (2) name a corporate officer upon whom process may be served."
