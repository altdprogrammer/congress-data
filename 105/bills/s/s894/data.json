    "text": "Hoopa Valley Reservation South Boundary Adjustment Act - Provides for: (1) conveyance of certain land in California to the Hoopa Valley Tribe for addition to the Hoopa Valley Reservation; (2) upon the inclusion of such lands in the Hoopa Valley Reservation, specified Forest Service system roads to be Indian Reservation roads; and (3) adjustment of the boundary of the Six Rivers National Forest to exclude such transferred land. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to survey and monument the portion of the boundary of the Reservation established by the addition of lands under this Act. States that the transfer of lands to trust status extinguishes the following claims by the Hoopa Valley Tribe: (1) all claims on land administered as of the date of enactment of this Act as part of the Six Rivers National Forest based on the allegation of error in establishing the boundaries of the Hoopa Valley Reservation, as those boundaries were configured before the date of enactment; and (2) all claims of failure to pay just compensation for a taking under the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, if such claims are based on activities, occurring before enactment of this Act, related to the lands transferred to trust status under this Act."
