    "text": "Prostate Testing Full Information Act - Requires any physician who has received any Federal payment or assistance under any program under the Public Health Service Act or the Social Security Act, if the physician examines a patient's prostate gland, to provide information on appropriate diagnostic procedures, including the prostate antigen test, if: (1) the patient is over 50, manifests clinical symptoms, or is at increased risk of prostate cancer; or (2) the provision of the information is, in the opinion of the physician, medically necessary. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to impose the same requirement as above and to declare that such information may not be prohibited under the terms of: (1) any agreement between the physician and any group health plan, insurance issuer providing group health coverage, or related party; or (2) any written statement from the plan, issuer, or related party. Amends the Public Health Service Act to declare that such information may not be prohibited under those terms by an issuer in the individual market. Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions relating to National Cancer Institute prostate cancer research. Requires the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, with regard to prostate cancer, to: (1) conduct and support research on the outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health services and procedures; and (2) in carrying out provisions relating to the Forum for Quality and Effectiveness in Health Care, provide for the development, review, and updating of clinically relevant guidelines, quality standards, performance measures, and medical review criteria."
