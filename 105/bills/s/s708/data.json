    "text": "Deadly Driver Reduction and Matthew P. Hammell Memorial Act - Amends Federal transportation law to require the Secretary of Transportation to withhold five percent of the funds authorized for Federal aid highway programs for FY 2001, and ten percent of such amounts for subsequent fiscal years, from any State that has not enacted and is not enforcing a law that provides a minimum penalty of revocation of a driver's license for at least 180 days in the case of a first offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, revocation for at least one year in the case of a second offense of any alcohol-related offense while operating a motor vehicle, and permanent revocation in the case of a third or subsequent such offense. Allows funds withheld from a State during FY 2001 to be available for up to the three subsequent fiscal years (to allow a State to meet such requirement within such period), but allows no grace period with respect to funds withheld during the subsequent fiscal years."
