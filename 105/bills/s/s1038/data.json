Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) place certain authorized one-dollar coins into circulation before the government's inventory of Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coins is depleted; and (2) increase capacity at U.S. Mint facilities to a level that permits replacement of one-dollar Federal reserve notes with one-dollar coins minted according to this Act. Prohibits the Federal reserve banks from ordering or placing into circulation one-dollar Federal Reserve notes after the Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coins and one-dollar coins minted according to this Act have reached a specified total in circulation. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to cease regular production of one-dollar Federal Reserve notes (except for such quantities ordered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to meet collectors' needs)."
