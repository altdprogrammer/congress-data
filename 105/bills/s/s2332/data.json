    "text": "Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act - Prohibits a court from granting relief in an action or proceeding challenging conditions of confinement of a correctional institution, unless such conditions constitute the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain due to the deliberate indifference of the administrators of the institution such that inmates are deprived of the minimum civilized measure of life's necessities. Establishes a presumption that if an institution makes a per-inmate expenditure equal to or exceeding the poverty guideline level, the administrators are not deliberately indifferent to the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain and the deprivation of the minimum civilized measure of life's necessities, which may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Specifies that a failure to make a per-inmate expenditure equal to or exceeding the poverty guideline level does not give rise to a presumption that the conditions of confinement of an institution are unconstitutional."
