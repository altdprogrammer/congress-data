    "text": "Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act - Amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to prohibit persons from: (1) taking migratory birds by the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where they know or should have known that the area is a baited area; or (2) placing or directing the placement of bait on or adjacent to an area for purposes of causing, inducing, or allowing any person to take or attempt to take any migratory bird by the aid of baiting on or over the baited area. Defines \"baiting\" as the placement of salt, grain, or other feed capable of attracting migratory birds in such a quantity and in such a manner as to serve as an attractant to such birds to or over an area where hunters are attempting to take them by: (1) placing or distributing salt, grain, or other feed grown off-site; (2) redistributing grain or other feed after it is harvested or removed from the site where grown; (3) altering agricultural crops (other than by accepted agricultural planting, harvesting, or manipulation after harvest), altering millet planted for nonagricultural purposes, or altering other nonagricultural vegetation; or (4) gathering, collecting, or concentrating natural vegetation, planted millet, or other vegetation planted for nonagricultural purposes following alteration or harvest. Excludes from such definition: (1) redistribution, alteration, or concentration of grain or other feed caused by flooding, whether natural or man induced; or (2) alteration of natural vegetation on the site where grown other than alterations described above. Makes other exclusions from such definition with respect to certain alterations of planted millet or other vegetation during the waterfowl hunting season. Amends penalty provisions to require the Secretary of the Interior, in lieu of seizing any personal property not crucial to the prosecution of the alleged offense, to permit the owner or operator of such property to post bond or other collateral pending the disposition of any proceeding."
