(Sec. 102) Revises the statement of purpose to promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of low-income children. (Sec. 103) Revises definitions of family literacy services, of full-working-day, and of migrant or seasonal Head Start program. Adds definitions of child with a disability and of reliable and replicable research. (Sec. 104) Provides for financial assistance to Head Start programs that enable children to attain school readiness (as well as to attain their full potential). (Sec. 105) Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for Head Start program activities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make available certain amounts for such program activities, transition activities, impact studies, and other research, demonstration and evaluation activities. (Sec. 106) Revises requirements for allotment of funds. Requires that each State initially receive an amount of Head Start funds equal to the amount received in FY 1998. Extends Head Start program eligibility for the Freely Associated States (the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau) through FY 2001 (or FY 2002, if legislation implementing the Compact of Free Association has not been enacted before the end of FY 2001). Terminates such eligibility after FY 2002.
