    "text": "Lobbying Disclosure Technical Amendments Act of 1997 - Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to exclude from the definition of \"covered executive branch official\" an employee whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character by: (1) the President for a position the President has excepted from the competitive service; or (2) the President or an agency head for a position excepted from the competitive service by statute. (Sec. 3) Excludes from the definition of \"lobbying contact\" any communication compelled by a Federal contract grant, loan, permit, or license. Adds to the definition of \"public official\" a group of governments acting together as an international organization. (Sec. 4) Revises requirements applicable to estimates by entities: (1) reporting lobbying expenditures under provisions relating to charitable, etc., (Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3)) organizations; or (2) covered by provisions prohibiting a trade or business expense deduction for lobbying expenses. Removes provisions allowing such a charitable, etc., organization to meet its semiannual lobbying reporting requirement by filing with the Senate and the House of Representatives the same report filed to satisfy Internal Revenue Code requirements. (Sec. 5) Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to exempt from a requirement to register as a foreign agent anyone who has engaged in lobbying activities and has registered (currently, anyone who is required to register and does register) under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995."
