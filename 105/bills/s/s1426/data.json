    "text": "Rights of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation Act of 1997 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit the President from designating a country a beneficiary developing country (BDC) eligible for trade benefits under the generalized system of preferences if such country is not implementing the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) or other intellectual property rights agreements within a specified period of time. Authorizes designation as a BDC of any country that has been denied such designation, or has had it withdrawn or suspended, if the President determines that the country is fully implementing TRIPS and other such agreements. Directs the U.S. Trade Representative to notify the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development of any country which is not implementing TRIPS and other such agreements. Requires such officials, and authorizes the President, to take specified actions to encourage countries to implement TRIPS and other such agreements."
