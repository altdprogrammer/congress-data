Declares that: (1) a State shall not be subject to numerical limitation in the granting of good cause waivers to victims of domestic violence; and (2) an individual granted such a good cause waiver shall not be counted in determinations of a State's compliance with certain participation rate requirements, or for purposes of determining penalties for certain State program failures."
