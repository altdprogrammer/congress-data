    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-03-14", 
    "text": "State and Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act of 1997 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit a landfill or incinerator, effective January 1, 1998, from receiving out-of-State municipal solid waste for disposal or incineration unless the owner or operator of the landfill or incinerator obtains authorization (as part of a host community agreement) from the affected local government. Requires owners or operators to make specified information regarding the facility available prior to seeking such authorization. Authorizes State Governors, unless inconsistent with a host community agreement or permit authorizing the receipt of out-of-State waste, to limit the quantity of out-of-State waste received at landfills and incinerators that received documented shipments of such waste in 1993 (or were authorized to receive pursuant to an agreement or permit entered into prior to this Act's enactment) to an annual amount equal to the quantity received in 1993. Authorizes States that imported more than 750,000 tons of out-of-State municipal solid waste in 1993, unless inconsistent with a host community agreement or permit authorizing the receipt of out-of- State waste, to limit the amount of such waste received for disposal at landfills and incinerators in the importing State as follows: (1) in 1998, 95 percent of the amount exported to the State in 1993; (2) in 1999 through 2003, 95 percent of the amount exported to the State in the previous year; and (3) in 2004 and each succeeding year, 65 percent of the amount exported in 1993. Establishes limitations on waste exports to landfills or incinerators not covered by host community agreements or permits authorizing receipt of out-of-State municipal solid waste. Exempts from the prohibition on receipt of out-of-State waste, except as otherwise provided, landfills and incinerators that: (1) received documented shipments of such waste during 1993; or (2) prior to this Act's enactment, entered into host community agreements or received permits authorizing the acceptance of such waste. Prohibits landfills or incinerators from receiving out-of-State waste in the absence of a host community agreement if the operating permit or license for the facility was denied or revoked. Permits the receipt of such waste without an authorization from the affected local government if the waste is generated within, and the landfill or incinerator is located within, the same bi-State level A metropolitan statistical area that contains two contiguous major cities located in different States. Allows local comprehensive solid waste management plans adopted pursuant to State or Federal law to take into account local and regional needs for solid waste disposal capacity, provided their implementation is consistent with this Act. Authorizes States that, pursuant to State law, imposed a special fee on the processing or disposal of out-of-State municipal waste on or before April 3, 1994, to continue to impose cost recovery surcharges for such activities subject to certain conditions."
