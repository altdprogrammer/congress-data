Declares that any hospital classified as a rural referral center by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for FY 1991 shall be so classified for FY 1998 and each subsequent fiscal year. Permits hospital geographic reclassification for purposes of disproportionate share payment adjustments. Permits rebasing of Medicare payment for sole community hospitals using FY 1994 and 1995 costs."
