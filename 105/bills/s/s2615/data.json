Requires the Secretary to: (1) implement pilot programs to employ residents of local communities at Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Kobuk Valley National Park, and Noatak National Preserve (all National Park System units located in northwest Alaska); (2) report the results to such committees; and (3) consult with Native Corporations, nonprofit organizations, and tribal entities in the immediate vicinity of such units, and to the extent practicable, involve them in the development of interpretive materials and the pilot programs relating to such units."
