Authorizes the administering authority (Department of Commerce), in determining the proper allocation of costs, to use value-based methodology, weight-based cost methodology, or any other methodology (whether revenue-based or otherwise) that: (1) is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the exporter country (or producing country, where appropriate); and (2) reasonably reflects the costs associated with the production and sale of each product. Applies this Act to goods from Canada and Mexico as well as from other countries."
