    "text": "National Environmental Education Amendments Act of 1998 - Amends the National Environmental Education Act to require that curricula, materials, and training programs developed with support from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Environmental Education be balanced and scientifically sound. (Sec. 2) Requires that implementation of the Act be through EPA. Eliminates requirements for a Director of the Office and a minimum number of staff. Allows activities to be carried out through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts. (Sec. 3) Reduces from 25 percent to 15 percent the percentage of funds to be obligated for environmental education grants of not more than $5,000. Prohibits the use of grants for certain lobbying activities. Requires the EPA Science Advisory Board to review and approve any guidance by the EPA Administrator before it is issued to applicants for such grants. (Sec. 4) Repeals the authority for environmental internships and fellowships. (Sec. 5) Eliminates all environmental education awards provided for under such Act, except the President's Environmental Youth Awards. (Sec. 6) Revises requirements for membership on the National Environmental Education Advisory Council. Requires that membership on the Federal Task Force on Environmental Education be open to representatives of any Federal agency actively engaged in environmental education. (Under current law, membership must include specified agency representatives.) Repeals specific requirements for contents of Advisory Council reports. (Sec. 7) Changes the name of the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation to the National Environmental Learning Foundation. Increases the size of the Foundation's Board of the Directors. Repeals the prohibition on the transmission of logos or other means of identification on materials donated to the Foundation for environmental education and training use. Allows acknowledgement of donors, but prohibits such acknowledgement from: (1) appearing in educational material to be presented to students; and (2) identifying a donor by means of a logo, letterhead, or other corporate commercial symbol, slogan, or product. (Sec. 8) Extends through FY 2004 the authorization of appropriations to the EPA for such Act. Revises funding limitations. Limits to 25 percent the amount available for administrative costs. Directs the EPA Administrator to report on expenses annually to the Congress."
