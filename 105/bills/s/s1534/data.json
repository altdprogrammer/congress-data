Provides that any period (up to three years) during which a borrower who is a member a reserve component of the armed forces is called or ordered to active duty (for more than 30 days) shall be excluded from the grace period (after the student ceases to carry at least a half-time academic load) before repayment of a student loan must begin. (Such grace period is six months for Stafford or Direct Stafford/Ford loans, and nine months for Perkins direct loans.)"
