    "text": "International Peacekeeping Reform Act of 1997 - Prohibits funds made available to the Department of State under the Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities Account, or under any law to pay for contributions for United Nations peacekeeping activities, from being available to the United Nations for the establishment, expansion, or modification in mission of a United Nations peacekeeping operation unless the President: (1) makes the certification required by this Act; and (2) notifies the Congress, at least 15 days before (or in the event of an emergency, within 48 hours after) any vote by the United Nations Security Council to establish, expand, or modify such operation, of the intent to support the operation. Directs the President to certify that the peacekeeping operation meets the following requirements: (1) the operation involves an international conflict in which hostilities have ceased and all significant parties to the conflict agree to the imposition of United Nations forces to seek an enduring solution to the conflict; (2) the percentage of the U.S.-assessed share of the operation's cost is no greater than the percentage of the share for the regular United Nations budget; (3) adequate measures have been taken by the United Nations to protect sensitive U.S.-supplied intelligence information; and (4) with respect to units of the U.S. armed forces trained to carry out direct combat missions, the operation advances U.S. national security interests, the units are critical to the success of the operation and will be under U.S. command and control, and any armed forces member would be protected by the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War."
