    "text": "Construction Safety, Health, and Education Improvement Act of 1997 - Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act) to set forth construction safety requirements. Establishes in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) an Office of Construction Safety, Health, and Education. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) identify construction employers that have high fatality rates or high lost workday injury or illness rates or who have demonstrated a pattern of noncompliance with safety and health standards, rules, and regulations; (2) develop a system for notification of such employers; (3) establish training courses and curriculum for the training of inspectors and other persons employed by OSHA who have duties related to construction safety and health; (4) establish model compliance programs for construction safety and health standards and assist employers, employees, and organizations representing employers and employees in establishing training programs appropriate to such standards; and (5) establish a toll-free line on which reports, complaints, and notifications required under the Act may be made. Establishes requirements for construction safety and health plans and programs. Requires each construction project to have an individual or entity (project constructor) that is responsible for the establishment of the safety and health plan for such project, and for ensuring that the plan is carried out. Requires any State plan that covers construction safety and health to contain requirements and enforcement provisions at least as effective as those under specified provisions of the Act and the Contract Work Hours Standards Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) include additional information on the construction industry and the operation of the Office in an annual report to the President; and (2) deliver to specified congressional committees recommendations for legislative changes required to make bidders' safety records a criterion to be considered in the awarding of Federal construction contracts."
