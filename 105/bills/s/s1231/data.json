    "text": "United States Fire Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999 - Amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999. Permits successor fire safety standards to be used as guidelines in addition to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 74, NFPA Standard 13 or 13-R, or NFPA Standard 101 (Life Safety Code) for installation of hard-wired, single-station smoke detectors or automatic sprinkler systems in: (1) places of public accommodation affecting commerce; and (2) federally-assisted buildings. Requires the Administrator of the U.S. Fire Administration to report to the Congress at least 60 days in advance on the termination or transfer to a private sector entity of any significant function of the Administration. Urges the Administrator to give high priority to correcting, assess the risk to operations posed by, plan and budget for, and develop contingency plans for date-related year 2000 problems in its computer systems. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Administrator should donate educationally useful Federal equipment to schools in order to enhance science and mathematics programs. Requires the Administrator to report to the President on such action. Directs the Administrator to report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Science on: (1) risks to fire fighters in suppressing fires caused by burning tires; and (2) special training required to suppress such fires and how the training may be provided by the Administration."
