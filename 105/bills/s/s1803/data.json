    "text": "Agricultural Credit Restoration Act - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to exclude from \"debt forgiveness\": (1) loan rescheduling, consolidation, deferral, or reamortization; (2) one debt forgiveness due to natural disaster or family medical condition; and (3) loan restructuring, write-down, or buy-out as part of the resolution of a discrimination complaint against the Secretary of Agriculture (thus excluding such situations from the ban on lending program eligibility for producers with restructured farm debt). Increases the number of permitted loan (including direct operating and guaranteed loan) write-downs or buy-outs per borrower from one to two. Eliminates the aggregate limitation on per borrower debt forgiveness. Authorizes interstate allocation of unused funds for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers."
