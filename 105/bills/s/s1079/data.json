    "text": "Permits the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) approve any mineral lease or agreement of allotted Indian land located within the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota if the owners of a majority of the undivided interest in the Indian land that is the subject of the lease or agreement consent to the lease or agreement; and (2) execute a lease or agreement of such land on behalf of an Indian owner if that owner is deceased and the heirs to the interest have not been determined, or the heirs have been determined, but one or more of the heirs cannot be located. Prohibits requiring such leases or agreements to be offered for sale through public auctions or advertised sales. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a pilot project on Federal lands within the Plumas, Lassen, and (the Sierraville Ranger District of) Tahoe National Forests, California, to demonstrate the effectiveness of specified fire resiliency resource management activities recommended by the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability proposal. Exempts spotted owl habitat and protected areas within the project area from such required activities and timber harvesting. Provides for riparian and roadless area protection. Limits: (1) annual project acreage; (2) funding sources; (3) project duration; and (4) report expenditures. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth status and final reporting provisions. Directs the Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation (established under the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990) to evaluate the advisability of making commercialization assistance loans for at least two demonstration projects to convert wood waste or low-quality wood byproducts into higher value products."
