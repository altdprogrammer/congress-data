Requires a plan administrator to disclose certain information relating to calculation of pension benefits upon the request of any participant or beneficiary entitled to a benefit distribution under an employee pension benefit plan. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess civil penalties for plan administrators' failures to disclose certain information to participants and beneficiaries. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a model alternative dispute resolution procedure to be adopted by any plan at its discretion for appeals of plan benefits claims denials to which certain ERISA provisions apply; and (2) maintain a roster of employee benefit experts who may be called upon to serve as neutral experts in such procedure. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) assess fees to cover the costs of experts called; and (2) reduce or waive such a fee on the basis of inability to pay."
