    "text": "United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 - Amends Federal law to mandate that the dollar coin shall: (1) be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, with tactile and visual features making it readily discernible; (2) be minted and fabricated in the United States; and (3) have similar metallic anticounterfeiting properties as U.S. clad coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to place into circulation $1 coins that comply with such mandate upon depletion of the Government's supply of $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to mint and issue $1 Susan B. Anthony coins if they are depleted before production has begun of the new $1 coins mandated by this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) adopt a marketing program promoting the use of $1 coins by commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities, and Federal, State, and local government agencies; and (2) study and report to the Congress on the progress of such marketing program."
