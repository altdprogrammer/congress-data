Includes as system elements: (1) an interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage of the United States; (2) fixed ground-based radar; (3) space-based sensors; and (4) battle management, command, control, and communications. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct an integrated systems test by the end of FY 1999; (2) use streamlined acquisition procedures; (3) develop a follow-on program that leverages off of, and that could augment, the NMD system to provide for a layered defense; and (4) report to the Congress on the plan for carrying out this Act, the appropriations required for FY 1998 through 2003, and the point at which activity would conflict with terms of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Urges the President, if necessary, to pursue high-level discussions with the Russian Federation to achieve an agreement to amend the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the NMD system. Requires the President to present any such agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent. Requires the President and the Congress, if such an agreement is not achieved within one year, to consider the option of withdrawing the United States from the ABM Treaty."
