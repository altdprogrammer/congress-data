    "text": "Child Exploitation Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1997 - Requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to: (1) review the Federal sentencing guidelines on aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, sexual abuse of a minor or ward, coercion and enticement of a juvenile, and transportation of minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity; and (2) promulgate amendments to the Guidelines to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement if the defendant used a computer or knowingly misrepresented his or her identity with the intent to persuade, entice, or coerce a child of an age specified in such sections to engage in prohibited sexual activity. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to: (1) review the Federal sentencing guidelines on criminal sexual abuse, the production of sexually explicit material, the possession of materials depicting a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct, coercion and enticement of minors, and the transportation of minors; and (2) promulgate amendments to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement in any case in which the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor. (Sec. 6) Amends the Federal criminal code to require a term of imprisonment of up to twice the period that would otherwise apply for repeat violations of Federal or State laws regarding illegal transportation for illegal sexual activity and related crimes, sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation and other abuse of children. Increases imprisonment penalties for specified offenses, including those pertaining to minors, with respect to transportation, the use of interstate commerce, and travel for purposes of engaging in criminal sexual activity. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and promulgate amendments to the Guidelines relating to: (1) transportation for illegal sexual activity and related crimes to provide for the amendments made by this Act; and (2) the distribution of pornography under the chapter relating to sexual exploitation and other abuse of children to clarify that the term \"distribution of pornography\" applies to its distribution for monetary remuneration or for a nonpecuniary interest. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Justice to procure the services of individuals to serve as guardians ad litem for children who are victims of, or witnesses to, crimes involving abuse or exploitation."
