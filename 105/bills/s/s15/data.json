(Sec. 103) Authorizes the Attorney General (AG) to make grants to States, local governmental units, Indian tribes, other public and private entities, and multijurisdictional or regional consortia to encourage the use of, and to implement, 311 (as opposed to 911) nonemergency telecommunication systems for public safety. Authorizes appropriations from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund (Fund) through FY 2002. Subtitle B: Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in- Sentencing Grants - Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to revise the formula allocation between States and U.S. territories and possessions for technical assistance and training to entities receiving grants under either the Violent Offender Incarceration or Truth-in-Sentencing grant programs.

Requires no less than 20 percent of the funds made available during FY 2001 and 2002 for the latter grant program to be used to provide increased resources to State juvenile courts, including its prosecutors, public defenders, and other juvenile court system participants. Title II: Youth Violence Control - Subtitle A: Federal Juvenile Prosecutions - Amends provisions concerning Federal juvenile prosecutions to require a predisposition report, which includes victim impact information, to be prepared by the probation officer and provided to the juvenile, his or her attorney, and the attorney for the government. Directs the juvenile court, after a dispositional hearing, to enter an order of restitution for the victim. Authorizes such court to suspend the findings of juvenile delinquency, place the juvenile on probation, commit the juvenile to official detention (including supervised release), and impose any fine that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult. Provides the terms of probation, official detention, or supervised release for such juveniles. Excludes time spent in the custody of the AG for observation and study from time served for a juvenile offense. Authorizes the court, with respect to any juvenile prosecuted and convicted as an adult, to treat the conviction as an adjudication of delinquency and impose any disposition authorized for an adult offender. Requires: (1) a juvenile adjudicated for an act that, if committed by an adult, would be a felony to be fingerprinted and photographed; (2) such records to be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and (3) the court to transmit to the FBI information concerning the adjudication and sentence. (Sec. 203) Directs a juvenile court, in determining whether an information should be dismissed with or without prejudice, to consider the seriousness of the offense, the facts and circumstances leading to the dismissal, and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of justice. Subtitle B: Assistance to States for Prosecuting and Punishing Youth Offenders - Authorizes the AG to make grants to assist States and local governments in planning, establishing, and operating secure facilities, staff-secure facilities, detention centers, and other correctional programs for violent juvenile offenders. Requires each facility or program funded under this subtitle to contain an evaluation component, developed under guidelines established by the AG, which includes outcome measures that may be used to determine the effectiveness of the funded programs. Requires periodic reviews and reports. Reserves a specified percentage of program funds for FY 1998 through 2002 for grants to Indian tribes for constructing correctional facilities and establishing correctional programs for the incarceration of tribal juvenile offenders. Requires a report from the AG to the Congress regarding the possible use of performance-based criteria in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of juvenile corrections facilities and programs. (Sec. 215) Authorizes the AG to make grants to States, State courts, local courts, local governments, and Indian tribes for: (1) providing juvenile courts with a range of sentencing options such that first time juvenile offenders face at least some level of punishment as a result of their initial contact with the juvenile justice system; and (2) increasing the sentencing options available to juvenile court judges so that juvenile offenders receive increasingly severe sanctions as the seriousness of their conduct increases and for each additional offense. Requires each applicant to submit a comprehensive implementation plan as part of such application. Provides for grant award uses and limitations, with a Federal share limit of 90 percent of the total program costs. Requires reports and evaluations: (1) from grant recipients to the AG; and (2) from the AG to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations from the Fund for FY 1998 through 2001. Subtitle C: Juvenile Gun Courts - Authorizes the AG to make grants to States, State courts, local courts, local governments, and Indian tribes for court-based juvenile justice programs that target juvenile firearm offenders through the establishment of juvenile gun courts.

(Sec. 242) Includes franchising a criminal street gang as a \"racketeering activity\" for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. (Sec. 243) Directs the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) to provide an appropriate enhancement with respect to any offense committed in connection with, or in furtherance of the activities of, a criminal street gang if the defendant is a member of the gang at the time of the offense. (Sec. 244) Increases the penalties for using physical force to tamper with witnesses, victims, or informants. (Sec. 245) Sets forth criminal penalties for using or carrying a firearm during and in close proximity to (currently, in relation to) any crime of violence or drug trafficking. Directs the USSC to provide an appropriate sentence enhancement with respect to a defendant who discharges a firearm during or in close proximity to a crime of violence or drug trafficking. (Sec. 246) Increases the penalties for transferring a firearm to a minor for use in a crime. (Sec. 247) Eliminates any statute of limitations with respect to any offense punishable by death or for a Class A felony involving murder. (Sec. 248) Extends to ten years after the commission of the offense the statute of limitations with respect to a Class A felony that is a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Part 2: Gang Paraphernalia - Authorizes the appropriate court to enter an order authorizing the installation and use by law enforcement personnel of a pen register or a trap and trace device within the jurisdiction of the court, or of a clone pager whose service provider is within the court's jurisdiction, if the court finds that the information likely to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. Authorizes a Federal court to order a provider of a paging service or other person to furnish to appropriate law enforcement personnel all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the operation and use of a clone pager unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with normal service. (Sec. 252) Directs the USSC to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any offense in which the defendant: (1) used body armor; (2) possessed a firearm equipped with a laser sighting device; or (3) possessed a firearm while another defendant possessed a firearm so equipped. Subtitle E: Rights of Victims in State Juvenile Courts - Directs the AG to establish guidelines for State programs to require: (1) prior to the disposition of adjudicated juvenile delinquents, that victims or their representatives are provided the opportunity to make a statement or present any relevant information; (2) that such victims be given notice of the disposition; and (3) that restitution to victims may be ordered as part of such a disposition. Requires State compliance with such requirements within three years, with an additional two-year extension authorized to be granted by the AG when a State is determined to be making a good faith effort to implement such requirements. Title III: Prevention and Treatment of Youth Drug Abuse and Addiction - Subtitle A: Protecting Youth from Dangerous Drugs - Directs the AG to add ketamine hydrochloride to schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act.
