Limits the annual aggregate amount of a State's tax-exempt financing. Sets forth State allocation rules, including a discretionary allocation for non high-growth school areas. Exempts such bonds from: (1) State volume caps; and (2) land use or acquisition limitations. Increases the arbitrage rebate exception for State and local bonds used to finance public schools."
