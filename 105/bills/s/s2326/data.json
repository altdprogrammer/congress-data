Directs the FTC to provide incentives for efforts of self-regulation by operators to implement appropriate protections for such information. Authorizes the States to enforce such regulations by bringing actions on behalf of residents, requiring the appropriate attorney general to first notify the FTC of such action. Authorizes the FTC to intervene in any such action. Provides for enforcement of this Act through the Federal Trade Commission Act. Directs the FTC to review and report to the Congress on the implementation of this Act."
