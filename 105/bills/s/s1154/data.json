    "text": "Dual-Use Debit Cardholder Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to impose consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers only if the issuer has provided a unique identifier, such as a photograph (as under current law), retina scan, and other named devices with which the user can be identified as the authorized person. Eliminates a signature as such a unique identifier. Cites circumstances under which a consumer shall be liable for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer not exceeding $50 if the transfer did not require the use of a unique identifier, such as a photograph, fingerprint, or retina scan. Precludes consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers in the absence of a consumer's timely receipt of notice of liability for such transfers, and of the advisability of prompt reporting of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use. Prohibits the issuance of dual-use debit cards to initiate an electronic fund transfer without the use of a unique identifier unless certain statutory requirements are met, and the issuer has provided a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the use of such card may not require the use of a unique identifier."
