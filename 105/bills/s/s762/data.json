Requires the superior officer to submit to the Secretary of the military department concerned a report on any such complaint and investigation. Requires each such Secretary to transmit to the Secretary of Defense, who shall then transmit to the Congress, all such reports received for the previous year. Requires the officer exercising general court martial jurisdiction over the accused to provide a thorough and impartial investigation of any complaint involving rape, forcible sodomy, or assault with intent to commit rape or sodomy upon a person subject to the UCMJ. Requires the accused to be advised of such allegations, to be represented by appropriate counsel, and to have full opportunity to cross-examine witnesses."
