Ratifies any such contracts entered into with respect to the land before the date of this Act's enactment. Requires management of Fort Stanton and the Rio Bonito Corridor to be consistent with any applicable land and resource management plan under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Directs that, of the proceeds of such vegetation sales contracts: (1) 12.5 percent be paid to the State of New Mexico for distribution to Lincoln County, New Mexico, for purposes authorized by the Act of June 28, 1934 (Taylor Grazing Act); (2) 12.5 percent be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury; and (3) 75 percent be deposited in a special Treasury account for use in managing Fort Stanton and the Rio Bonito Corridor and to achieve the management goals and prescriptions identified in applicable resource management plans for the Rio Bonito acquired lands and the Fort Stanton area of critical environmental concern, but not for land acquisition."
