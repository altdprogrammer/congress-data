Extinguishes upon the conveyance date all current obligations between the District and: (1) the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and (2) the Bureau of Land Management. Requires the District to pay 50 percent of all title transfer costs. Authorizes the Secretary to convey a remaining fractional interest in such Project to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, pursuant to a specified memorandum of understanding. Provides for: (1) the transfer of certain inundated lands along the Dam and Reservoir; and (2) appropriate administrative jurisdiction over such lands after such transfer. Prohibits such conveyance until the completion of specified events, including compliance with applicable environmental laws, issuance of a statement by the Ute Tribe to the Secretary that their trust assets have been protected, execution of an agreement acceptable to the Secretary which limits the future liability of the United States relative to the operation of the Project, and development of a flood control plan by the Secretary of the Army which shall direct the District in the operation of the Vallecito Dam for such purpose. Directs the Secretary, if the transfer is not substantially completed within 18 months from the enactment of this Act, to report to specified congressional committees on the transfer's status, obstacles, and anticipated completion date."
