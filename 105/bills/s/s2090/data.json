Reformulates the aggregate annual charges collected from all licensees to factor in the costs of certain NRC activities for FY 1999 and thereafter. Requires the NRC to take specified considerations into account when it determines which costs of its activities would be inequitable to include in licensee assessments. Sets a ceiling for such maximum excluded costs."
