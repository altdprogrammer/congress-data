(Sec. 102) Directs the President, except where an emergency exists that does not permit sufficient time, to seek the advice of the Congress before any use of force abroad.

Provides for periodic reporting on the status, scope, and expected duration of the use of force. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the President to continue a use of force abroad for longer than 60 days after the date by which the Use of Force report is required only if: (1) the Congress has declared war or provided specific statutory authorization for the extended period; (2) the President has requested the Congress to enact a joint resolution constituting such a declaration or authorization but the resolution has not been subject to a vote in each House; or (3) the President has certified to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that an emergency exists that threatens the U.S. national interests and requires the period of limitation to be exceeded. (Sec. 105) Sets forth conditions under which joint or concurrent resolutions involving declarations of war and the use of force abroad shall receive expedited consideration in the Congress.
