Provides that, if a child with a disability qualifies for special education, that child does not have to be classified by a specific impairment or condition. Requires the State educational agency (SEA) to: (1) examine data to determine if significant racial disproportionality is occurring in the identification or placement of children under IDEA; and (2) review and revise policies accordingly. Provides that, if a hearing officer agrees with the parents' unilateral placement of a child with a disability in a private school, the LEA may be required to reimburse the parents. Requires a non-educational agency, if it is responsible for services necessary to ensure a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities, to pay for or provide such services directly or by contract or other arrangements. Requires States to: (1) ensure that interagency agreements or other mechanisms are in effect between educational agencies and non-educational agencies for defining respective financial responsibilities, resolving interagency disputes, and interagency coordination; and (2) establish a mechanism by which LEAs may seek reimbursement from agencies for the costs of providing related services. Revises requirements for a comprehensive system of personnel development. Allows LEAs to use appropriately trained and supervised paraprofessionals. Requires States to: (1) establish performance goals and indicators for children with disabilities; (2) ensure that these children participate in general State and district-wide assessments, with appropriate accommodations, where necessary; and (3) develop guidelines for participation in alternative assessments for those children who cannot participate in such general State and district-wide assessments.

Requires consideration of transition services needs: (1) for all students with disabilities beginning at age 14 (or younger, under specified circumstances); (2) under the applicable components of the IEP; and (3) in light of the student's participation in the general curriculum. Provides for transfer of rights at the age of majority. (Sec. 205) Repeals certain IDEA provisions relating to treatment of State agencies that received certain kinds of funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964.

Permits the transfer of parental rights to a student with disabilities upon reaching the age of majority under State law. Requires the State to have procedures for appointing the parent or another person to represent the student's interests if, under State law, such a student is determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent. Prescribes alternate procedural safeguards for short-term and long-term disciplinary actions with respect to children with disabilities who violate the LEA's rules or code of conduct, engage in serious disruptive behavior, or engage in any such behavior involving dangerous weapons, drugs, or actions resulting in serious bodily injury. Requires such rules or code of conduct to apply to children without disabilities as well. Provides for due process hearings with respect to disagreements between an agency and parents over determinations by a principal to remove a child with disabilities to an interim alternative educational setting. (Sec. 207) Revises requirements for: (1) withholding of payments from non-compliant States and judicial review of such determinations; (2) rulemaking on compliance and eligibility; (3) evaluation and program information; (4) preschool grants; and (5) payments. (Sec. 209) Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct studies and evaluations to assess the effectiveness of efforts to provide free appropriate public education and early intervention services, including assessing the placement of children with disabilities by disability category; and (2) conduct a longitudinal study that measures the educational and transitional services provided to and results achieved by children with disabilities under IDEA. Title III: Systems Change - Establishes a program to promote systems change to improve educational and transitional services and results for children with disabilities. Authorizes competitive grants to SEAs, in partnership with LEAs and other interested individuals, agencies, and organizations, to improve such services and results on a system-wide basis.
