(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to: (1) renegotiate all treaties requiring the consent of such an alien to such a transfer; and (2) withdraw the United States as a party to any such treaty requiring such consent if the Secretary is unable to negotiate a new treaty that would go into effect by December 31, 1998. Specifies that the consent of an alien covered by this title shall not be required before such alien may be designated for transfer or before such alien may be transferred to the country of nationality of that alien. (Sec. 104) Directs the President, by March 1 of each year, to submit to the Congress: (1) a certification as to whether each foreign country has accepted, and has confined for the duration of their sentences, such persons; and (2) a report describing the operation of the provisions of this title, particularly with regard to the ten countries having the greatest number of their nationals incarcerated in the United States. (Sec. 107) Provides for the withholding of bilateral assistance, opposition to multilateral development assistance, and withholding of visas with respect to countries refusing to accept at least 75 percent of such nationals designated for transfer or to confine such persons for at least 85 percent of their sentences, with exceptions. Sets forth provisions regarding certification procedures, waivers, congressional review, and denial of assistance for countries decertified. (Sec. 108) Directs: (1) the Secretary to begin to negotiate and renegotiate bilateral prisoner transfer treaties; and (2) the President to submit to Congress an annual certification as to whether each such treaty in force is effective.
