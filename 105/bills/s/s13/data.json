Sets forth State responsibilities, including certification of plans and income verification. Requires each health insurance issuer that provides health coverage under contract with any Federal program and that offers family coverage to apply to the State insurance commissioner for certification. Makes a noncomplying issuer ineligible to provide benefits under a Federal contract. (Sec. 102) Sets forth procedures for obtaining coverage under certified plans. Requires payment of premiums to the State and from the State to the plans of enrollment. (Sec. 103) Regulates the subsidy percentage, basing it on family income as related to the poverty line. (Sec. 104) Prohibits, with regard to subsidy eligible children: (1) preexisting condition exclusions; (2) insurance issuer discrimination on the basis of health status (including medical condition, claims experience, genetic information, and disability); and (3) employment discrimination. (Sec. 105) Prohibits States from modifying eligibility under the State Medicaid program (title XIX of the Social Security Act) in any way that would reduce the eligibility of children for Medicaid coverage. (Sec. 106) Provides for Federal action if a State fails to carry out this title. Title II: Health Insurance Coverage for Pregnant Women - Mandates programs of: (1) grants to States to assist pregnant women in obtaining prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal care; and (2) categorical grants to States to assist children and pregnant women in obtaining health care services and coverage. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Children's Health Coverage Subsidy Credits - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit for the premium subsidies provided by an insurance issuer under this Act. Mandates transfer from the general fund to the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds and the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund of amounts sufficient to cover the decreased tax revenues resulting from the credit. (Sec. 302) Allows a credit for the premium subsidy determined under this Act."
