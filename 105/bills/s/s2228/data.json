    "text": "Advisory Committee Termination and Streamlining Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal Advisory Committee Act to terminate, three years after the enactment of this Act, each advisory committee established, authorized, or reauthorized by statute, with the exception of any advisory committee the purpose of which is to: (1) provide for peer review of Federal grant or research applications or similar activities; (2) provide advice and recommendations relating to academic certification of Federal institutions; or (3) address critical needs relating to health, safety, national security, or other concerns as the President may certify. Directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to prescribe regulations (currently, administrative guidelines) applicable to advisory committees. Changes to March 15 the deadline for the submission of the annual report by the President to the Congress on the activities, status, and changes in the composition of advisory committees in existence during the preceding fiscal year. Revises the requirement for public notice of advisory committee meetings to be published in the Federal Register to require the Administrator to prescribe regulations to provide for other types of public notice in addition to, or in lieu of, notices in the Federal Register."
