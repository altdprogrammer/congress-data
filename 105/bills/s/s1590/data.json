Title II: Dollars to the Classroom - Requires the Secretary of Education to award directly to the States the total amount of all the funds (except those used for specified multiyear awards) that are appropriated for the Department of Education for the fiscal year for specified programs or activities under: (1) the Goals 2000: Educate America Act; (2) the Educational Research, Development, Disseminations, and Improvement Act of 1994; (3) the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994; and (4) the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). (Sec. 201) Sets deadlines for: (1) each State to conduct a census to determine, and report to the Secretary, the number of kindergarten through grade 12 students in the State for the academic year; and (2) the Secretary to publish and disburse the amount each State will receive under this Act for the succeeding fiscal year. Sets forth: (1) a formula for determination of such award amounts, based on relative numbers of such students in each State; and (2) penalties for false information. Provides for continuation of certain multiyear awards made prior to enactment of this Act. Requires award amounts under this Act to be paid to the State Governor, who shall make them available to the individual or entity in the State responsible for the State administration of Federal education funds. Prescribes requirements for the use of such funds, earmarking not less than 95 percent for distribution to local educational agencies (LEAs) for the costs of activities or services provided in the classroom that LEAs determine appropriate, excluding associated administrative expenses, but including nonadministrative expenses associated with statewide or districtwide initiatives directly affecting classroom learning.

Gives priority to eligible entities that: (1) are conducting a school choice program, involving public or private schools, on the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) operate a school choice program, involving public and private schools, that is authorized by Federal law. Requires 90 percent of such grants (85 percent the first year) to be used for providing education certificates to low-income parents to pay tuition, fees, allowable transportation costs, and costs of certain special programs, for their eligible children to attend a choice school. Declares that such education certificates shall be considered as aid to students, not to the choice school. Provides that such education certificates shall not be considered income to an eligible child or its parent for Federal, State, or local tax purposes, or for determining eligibility for any other Federal program. Title IV: Testing and Merit Pay for Teachers - Authorizes States to use Federal education funds to: (1) carry out an assessment of the performance of each elementary or secondary school teacher in the State; (2) establish a merit pay program for the teachers; or (3) hire elementary or secondary school teachers who are certified or licensed to teach in the State.

Sets forth requirements for subgrant duration, applications, agencies, priorities, authorized activities, and administrative costs. Allows subgrantees to train, on a fee-for-service basis, personnel from schools or LEAs that are not subgrant recipients, in the instructional practices based on reliable, replicable research on reading used by the recipient. Requires partnerships that receive such grants to make competitive tutorial assistance subgrants to LEAs with at least one school: (1) located in an empowerment zone or an enterprise community; or (2) identified for school improvement. Sets forth application requirements and authorized uses of such subgrants. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a national assessment of programs under this Act; (2) receive recommendations from the peer review panel in developing the criteria for the assessment; and (3) submit the findings of the assessment to such panel. Requires the National Institute for Literacy to disseminate information on reliable, replicable research on reading and on subgrantee projects that have proven effective. Requires each reading and literacy partnership to: (1) evaluate subgrantees success; (2) submit the findings of the evaluations to the Secretary and the peer review panel, who will submit a summary to the appropriate congressional committees; and (3) provide for program participation by children enrolled in private schools. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 through 2001.

Authorizes the LEA to use program funds to pay certain supplementary costs for such students to attend any other public or private elementary school or secondary school, including a religious school, in that State, that is selected by the student's parent. (Sec. 612) Authorizes States, State educational agencies (SEAs), or LEAs to transfer any non-Federal public funds associated with the education of a student who is a victim of a violent criminal offense while in or on the grounds of a public elementary school or secondary school served by an LEA to another LEA or to a private elementary school or secondary school, including a religious school. Subtitle B: Victim and Witness Assistance Programs for Teachers and Students - Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to authorize: (1) use of victim compensation program grant funds for compensation to students who are victims of school violence; and (2) grants for a demonstration project or for training and technical assistance services to a program that assists SEA and LEA programs designed to protect victims of and witnesses to incidents of school violence, or that supports a toll-free hotline that provides school students and teachers with confidential assistance on issues of school crime, violence, drug dealing, and threats to personal safety. Subtitle C: Innovative Programs to Protect Teachers and Students - Authorizes appropriations for the grants program established under this subtitle. (Sec. 633) Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to States, SEAs, and LEAs for innovative programs to improve unsafe elementary schools or secondary schools. Gives priority to programs that: (1) provide parent and teacher notification of about incidents of physical violence, weapon possession, or drug activity on school grounds as soon after the incident as practicable; (2) report annually to parents and teachers on the total number of incidents of physical violence, weapon possession, and drug activity on school grounds, the percentage of students missing ten or fewer days of school, with a comparison to previous annual reports; and (3) enhance school security measures. Title VII: Charter School Expansion - Charter Schools Expansion Act of 1998 - Amends ESEA to revise requirements for grants to public charter schools. (Sec. 702) Increases from three years to five years the duration of grants or subgrants for planning, design, or initial implementation of charter schools. Sets forth certain priorities for awarding grants to SEAs. Bases such priorities on requirements of State laws regarding charter schools' budget autonomy, increased numbers, and periodic review and evaluation. Includes among requirements for SEA applications a description of how the SEA will: (1) inform each charter school of available Federal programs and funds that each such school is eligible to receive; (2) ensure that each such school receives its commensurate share of Federal education funds allocated by formula; and (3) disseminate best or promising practices of charter schools to LEAs. Includes among selection criteria for awarding grants to SEAs the number of charter schools created in the State. Eliminates provisions for State revolving trust funds for charter schools. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) reserve a specified amount for national activities on behalf of such schools (including assistance in accessing private capital, and pilot projects to better understand and improve such access); and (2) (along with SEAs) ensure that each public charter school receives its full share of funding for LEAs for helping disadvantaged children meet high standards or of any other Federal educational assistance purpose. Sets forth requirements for student records transfer and for paperwork reduction. Specifies that a public charter school: (1) must have a performance contract with the authorized public chartering agency in the State; and (2) is a school to which parents choose to send their children.
