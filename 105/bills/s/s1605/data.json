Provides that a qualifying State, unit of local government, or Indian tribe may not receive less than .5 percent nor more than five percent of the total amount appropriated in each fiscal year for such grants, and that a State, together with grantees within the State, may not receive more than 20 percent of the total amount appropriated in each fiscal year for such grants. Limits the portion of program costs provided by such grant to 50 percent. Authorizes the use of funds appropriated by the Congress for the activities of any agency of an Indian tribal government or the Bureau of Indian Affairs performing law enforcement functions on Indian lands for the non-Federal share of a matching requirement funded under this Act. Requires that at least half of the funds available under this Act be awarded to local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents. Sets forth application requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that entities receiving assistance under this Act should, in expending such assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products."
