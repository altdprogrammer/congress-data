Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services to establish a process for identifying and selecting an eligible entity to which a station could be conveyed for education, park, recreation, cultural, and historic preservation purposes. Requires: (1) the Secretary to review all applicants for the conveyance of a station identified as excess to an agency's needs and forward to the Administrator a single approved application for such station; (2) the Administrator to convey such station, subject to specified conditions that include a requirement that active aids to navigation continue to be operated and maintained by the United States if considered necessary by the Administrator; and (3) subject to the same conditions and any other terms or conditions the Secretary considers necessary to protect the resources of the park unit or wildlife refuge, the Secretary's approval before the conveyance or sale of such stations located within the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit or a refuge within the National Wildlife Refuge System. Requires: (1) a station to be offered for sale in accordance with terms developed by the Administrator if no applicants are approved for conveyance; and (2) net sale proceeds to be transferred to the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program. Requires any Federal department or agency to which a station is conveyed to maintain the station in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Secregtary's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, and other applicable laws. Authorizes appropriations."
