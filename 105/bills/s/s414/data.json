(Sec. 102) Redefines the term \"deferred rebate\" with respect to common carriers and shippers to make its payment conditional upon the shipper's agreeing to make a further shipment with that or any other common carrier. Includes \"agreement\" and \"deferred rebate arrangements\" within the scope of \"loyalty contracts.\" Repeals definitions for \"fighting ship\" and \"maritime labor agreement.\" Defines \"ocean transportation intermediary\" as an ocean freight forwarder or a non-vessel-operating common carrier. Redefines \"service contract\" and \"shipper.\" (Sec. 103) Revises the scope of the Act, with respect to certain agreements by or among ocean common carriers, to exclude from coverage agreements among ocean common carriers to engage in exclusive, preferential, or cooperative working arrangements with non-vessel-operating common carriers. Includes within the Act agreements by or among ocean common carriers to discuss and agree on any matter related to service contracts. (Sec. 104) Reduces from ten days to five days the deadline for a member of a shipping conference to give notice of independent action on a rate or service item. Prohibits ocean common carrier agreements from prohibiting or restricting members from negotiating service contracts, from requiring disclosure of negotiations on, or terms and conditions of, service contracts, or adopting mandatory rules or requirements affecting the right of an agreement member to negotiate and enter into such contracts. Permits an agreement to provide authority to adopt voluntary guidelines for the terms and procedures of such service contracts, if the guidelines explicitly state the right of members not to follow them. (Sec. 105) Declares that the Act does not extend antitrust immunity to loyalty contracts (a contract with an ocean common carrier or conference, other than a service contract or contract based upon time-volume rates, in which a shipper obtains lower rates by committing all or a fixed portion of its cargo to that carrier or conference). (Sec. 106) Repeals the requirement that a common carrier or conference file tariffs with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), replacing it with a requirement that it keep tariffs open to public inspection in an automated tariff system. Excludes new assembled motor vehicles, among other currently specified items, from this requirement. Mandates that tariffs be made available electronically to the public for inspection, for a reasonable charge but without time, quantity, or other limitation. Revises provisions regarding: (1) service contracts between individual common carriers or among several ocean common carriers and one or more shippers; (2) publication of tariff rates and marine terminal operator schedules; (3) refund of freight charges collected from a shipper by a common carrier or conference for tariff errors (allowing such a refund only for failure to publish a new tariff or for an error in quoting a tariff); and (4) automated tariff systems. Requires the essential terms of service contracts filed with the FMC to be published and made available to the public. Requires an ocean common carrier that is a party to a collective bargaining agreement to state, upon request by the labor organization, whether it is responsible for certain work at U.S. dock and port areas with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract. (Sec. 107) Amends the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act to repeal its automated tariff filing and information system requirements. (Sec. 108) Amends the Act to revise requirements for FMC determination of the unjustness and unreasonableness of controlled carrier rates. Changes the FMC's authority to disapprove unjust and unreasonable rates to authority to prohibit them. (Sec. 109) Revises the enumeration of prohibited acts by common carriers with respect to the provision of ocean transportation services. Repeals current prohibitions against: (1) charging compensation for transportation service different from that shown in published tariffs or service contracts; (2) rebating portions of rates except in accordance with tariffs or service contracts; (3) extending or denying privileges, concessions, equipment, or facilities except in accordance with tariffs or service contracts; (4) using a loyalty contract, except in conformity with antitrust laws; (5) demanding, charging, or collecting any rate that is unjustly discriminatory between shippers or ports; (6) giving any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage (except for service contracts) to any particular person, locality, or description of traffic; (7) subjecting any particular person, locality, or description of traffic to an unreasonable refusal to deal or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage; (8) employing any fighting ship; or (9) refusing to negotiate with a shippers' association. Replaces such prohibitions with prohibitions against: (1) providing service in the liner trade that is not in accordance with the rates, classifications, rules, and practices contained in a tariff or service contract (unless exempted), or is under a tariff or service contract which has been suspended or prohibited by the FMC or the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988; (2) for service pursuant to a service contract, engaging in any unfair or unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of rates or charges, or giving any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage, or imposing any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, with respect to any port; (3) for service pursuant to a tariff, giving any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or imposing any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage; (4) using a vessel in a particular trade to exclude, prevent, or reduce competition by driving another ocean common carrier out of that trade; or (5) unreasonably refusing to deal or negotiate. Substitutes \"an ocean transportation intermediary\" for \"non-vessel-operating common carrier\" and \"freight forwarders\" with respect to certain enumerated prohibitions. Revises certain provisions with respect to a conference or group of two or more common carriers to prohibit them from: (1) negotiating with a nonocean carrier or group of nonocean carriers (for example, truck, rail, or air operators) on any matter relating to rates or services provided to ocean common carriers by such nonocean carriers, unless such negotiations and any resulting agreements are not in violation of the antitrust laws and are consistent with the purposes of this Act; or (2) for service pursuant to a service contract, engaging in any unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of rates or charges, or giving any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage, or imposing any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, with respect to any locality, port, or persons due to those persons' status as shippers' associations or ocean transportation intermediaries. Prohibits a marine terminal operator from giving any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or imposing any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to any person.
