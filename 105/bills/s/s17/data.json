(Sec. 102) Allows an individual to: (1) receive such a voucher for two years beginning on the date of application approval; and (2) use such voucher to purchase authorized job training. (Sec. 103) Makes individuals eligible for such vouchers if they are dislocated workers or economically disadvantaged adults. (Sec. 104) Requires one-stop career centers (established under title III of this Act) to provide: (1) applications for vouchers, as well as assistance in completing them and collection of them for eligibility determinations; (2) performance-based information on service providers; and (3) information on local economy, employment, industries, and labor market demand. Requires conflict of interest standards for centers operated by entities that are concurrently eligible job training providers. (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary to issue oversight and accountability regulations relating to such vouchers. (Sec. 106) Sets forth eligibility requirements for providers of job training, including requirements for submission of performance-based information. (Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary to monitor and evaluate the voucher system annually, and report to the appropriate congressional committees. (Sec. 108) Provides for apportionment of system funds to States based on relative numbers of individuals in service delivery areas (SDAs) who are: (1) unemployed individuals; (2) excess unemployed individuals; (3) individuals who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or more; and (4) economically disadvantaged adults. Requires at least 75 percent of such funds to be made available as vouchers. Title II: Consolidation of Federal Job Training Programs - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the consolidation and streamlining of Federal job training programs should not reduce Federal commitment and effort to improve education, employment, and earnings of all workers and jobseekers, particularly those in hard-to-serve communities. Repeals specified employment training program provisions under the Job Training Partnership Act, Food Stamp Act of 1977, Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, and Displaced Homemakers Self-Sufficiency Assistance Act, as well as under a specified Federal law relating to certain workers affected by an expansion of Redwood National Park in California. Title III: Employment-Related Information and Services Through One-Stop Career Centers - Requires each service delivery area receiving funds under this Act to develop and implement a network of one-stop career centers to provide access for jobseekers, workers, and businesses to a comprehensive array of high quality job training and employment-related services (including provision of information). Requires each workforce development entity for an SDA to negotiate with the State a method for establishing such centers (including designating one-stop career center operators), consistent with criteria the Secretary prescribes. Makes each entity within the service delivery area that provides specified job training or employment-related services eligible to be designated a center operator for a two-year period (renewable after evaluation). Directs the Secretary to establish a performance standard system for assessing the performance of each center operator. Lists employment related services such centers may offer to individuals and to employers. (Sec. 302) Authorizes the Secretary to make arrangements with public or private entities to develop and provide relevant regional labor market information to interested individuals. (Sec. 303) Directs the Department of Education to try to make known the value and availability of direct loans through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, through cooperative arrangements with one-stop career centers, training and educational training programs, State agencies, and other Federal agencies. Title IV: Reports and Plans - Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on how additional Federal job training programs not covered by this Act can be consolidated into a more integrated and accountable workforce development system. Directs the Secretary to develop a plan that, wherever practicable, requires the Federal job training programs to use common definitions, outcome measures, eligibility standards, and funding cycles. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the need for income support, and options for providing it, to enable dislocated workers and economically disadvantaged adults to participate in long-term job training. Title V: General Provisions - Authorizes appropriations."
