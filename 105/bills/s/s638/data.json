Sets forth requirements and administrative procedures for such exchange, including issuance of monetary credits to a holder for payment of not more than 50 percent of: (1) the bonus or other payments made by successful bidders in any sales of mineral, oil, gas, or geothermal leases under the Mineral Leasing Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970; or (2) any royalty, rental, or advance royalty payment made to the United States to maintain any mineral, oil or gas, or geothermal lease issued under such Acts."
