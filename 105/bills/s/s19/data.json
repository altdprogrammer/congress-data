    "text": "Working Families Child Care Act of 1997 - Amends the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to extend its authorization of appropriations through FY 2002. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, from (additional) Treasury funds not otherwise appropriated, to award grants to States to provide child care services for: (1) families who have left the State program of assistance under part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) of title IV of the Social Security Act because of employment; (2) families that are at risk of becoming dependent on such assistance program; and (3) low-income working families meeting specified criteria. Authorizes appropriations for grants to States for child care activities in areas of the State that have child care supply shortages. Includes among such child care activities programs for: (1) infant care; (2) before- and after-school; (3) resources and referrals; (4) nontraditional work hours; (5) extending the hours of pre-kindergarten programs to provide full-day services; and (6) any other program the Secretary deems appropriate. Requires State reports to include information on access to child care by low-income working families. Requires reports of the Secretary to place particular emphasis on such access. (Sec. 6) Makes this Act effective as if included in the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)."
