Restores the status of certain revested Oregon and California railroad grant land (O&C land) and revokes the reservation of such lands as part of the National Forest. Adds certain other revested railroad grant lands to such National Forest. Title II: Protection of Oregon and California Railroad Grant Land - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out sales, purchases, and exchanges of Bureau of Land Management land located within six Oregon districts (the geographic area), to ensure that, upon the expiration of a ten-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and each ten-year period thereafter, the total number of acres of O&C land, Coos Bay Wagon Road grant land, and public domain land in the geographic area that are available for timber harvesting is not less than such number on the date of enactment of this Act. Title III: Conveyance to Deschutes County, Oregon - Directs the Secretary to sell at fair market value to Deschutes County, Oregon, specified land in Deschutes County. Provides for the conveyance of such land only if the Secretary determines it suitable for sale through the land use planning process. States that the amount paid by the County for the conveyance of the land: (1) shall be deposited in a special account in the Treasury; and (2) may be used by the Secretary for the purchase of certain environmentally sensitive land in Oregon that is consistent with the goals and objectives of the land use planning process of the Bureau."
