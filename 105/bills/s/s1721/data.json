Requires the Judicial Conference of the United States to complete a review and report to the Congress on: (1) whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended to guarantee that the confidentiality of communications by a child to his or her parent in matters that do not involve allegations of violent or drug trafficking conduct will be adequately protected in Federal court proceedings; and (2) if so, a proposal for amendments that provide the maximum protection possible within constitutional limits and without compromising public safety or the integrity of the judicial system."
