Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from conducting any preleasing activity, or holding any lease sale in the South Atlantic Planning Area off the coast of Florida, the Straits of Florida Planning Area, or the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area within 100 miles of the Florida coast. Requires the Secretary to cancel the six leases known as the \"Pensacola Block 933 Unit.\" Prohibits the Secretary from approving any exploration or development plan or permit to drill with respect to such lease areas, prior to the Secretary's cancellation of those leases. Provides for compensation to lessees owning canceled leases."
