(Sec. 4) Amends such Act to provide a State, to be eligible for a truth-in-sentencing incentive grant, to demonstrate that the State has: (1) implemented truth-in-sentencing laws that require or result in persons convicted of a part 1 violent crime serving 100 percent of the sentence imposed (currently, 85 percent); and (2) enacted and implemented a victim damages law."
