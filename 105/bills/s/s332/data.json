Requires the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to identify foreign countries that: (1) do not comply with national laws that prohibit child labor in the workplace; (2) utilize child labor in the export of products; and (3) have on a continuing basis exported such products to the United States. Authorizes any person to file a petition with the Secretary requesting that a particular foreign industry and its host country be identified. Requires the Secretary, before making such identification, to: (1) consult with the U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of the Treasury; (2) hold at least one public hearing for public comment; and (3) publish notice in the Federal Register, inviting public comment, that such identification is being considered. Prohibits the importation of products which have been produced by child labor. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties. Authorizes appropriations for a U.S. contribution to: (1) the International Labor Organization for the activities of the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor; and (2) the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for those activities relating to bonded child labor that are carried out by the Subcommittee and Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery."
