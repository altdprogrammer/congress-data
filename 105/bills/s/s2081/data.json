    "text": "National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998 - States that, for each year from FY 2000 until 2008, it shall be an objective of the Secretary of: (1) Defense to increase the Defense Science and Technology Program (DSTP) budget by not less than two percent over inflation over the year before; and (2) Energy to increase the budget for nonproliferation science and technology activities by not less than two percent over inflation over the year before. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to expend funds from Department of Defense (DOD) 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3 accounts in supporting any individual DSTP project or program. Directs the Secretary to attempt to leverage commercial research, technology, products, and processes for the benefit of DOD. Allows funds made available to the DSTP to be used only to benefit DOD. Includes as key DSTP objectives: (1) the sustainment of research capabilities in scientific and engineering disciplines critical to DOD; (2) the education and training of the next generation of scientists and engineers in disciplines relevant to future defense systems; and (3) the continued support of the Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research and research programs at historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions."
