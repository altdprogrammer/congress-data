    "text": "Tobacco Products Control Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (with regard to cigarettes) and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (with regard to smokeless tobacco products) to make unlawful, subject to exceptions: (1) advertising on certain outdoor billboards; (2) advertising in publications having more than 15 percent of their total subscribership under 18 years old; (3) advertising in any arena or stadium where amateur or professional sporting events or activities occur; (4) payments for the use of a trade or brand name of a non- tobacco product as the trade or brand name for a cigarette or a smokeless tobacco product; (5) advertising in public transportation vehicles, terminals, or platforms; (6) product placement (paid for by a manufacturer) as a prop in any general public motion picture; and (7) placement of a brand name or logo in a video, on a video game machine, or in a family amusement center. Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit or reduce, starting in FY 1997, formula grants to States for prevention and treatment of substance abuse unless the State has a law: (1) prohibiting the sale or distribution of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 and requiring official photographic identification for transactions involving an individual who appears to be under the age of 26; (2) regulating in specified ways cigarette or smokeless tobacco product vending machines; (3) prohibiting the distribution without charge of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products or the distribution of coupons redeemable for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products; (4) prohibiting the sale or distribution of non-tobacco merchandise related to cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products; (5) prohibiting product displays open to non-employees; and (6) prohibiting retailers from opening packages and selling or distributing quantities smaller than the smallest package. Allows amounts from the formula grants to be used to enforce such State laws. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to declare that nothing in the FDCA or any other Act shall provide the Food and Drug Administration with any authority to regulate in any manner tobacco or tobacco products."
