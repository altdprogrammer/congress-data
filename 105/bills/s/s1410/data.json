    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-11-07", 
    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a telecommunications carrier to verify a subscriber's selection of a telephone exchange or toll (long distance) service in written or oral form (including a voice recording), and to retain such verification in a manner and form considered appropriate by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Outlines verification requirements, including notification to the subscriber within five business days of an exchange or toll change. Allows a person or entity, if otherwise permitted under State law, to bring a private right of action in a State court based on a violation of subscriber selection and verification requirements, with authorized damages. Allows a State to bring a civil action in the appropriate U.S. district court on behalf of its residents. Requires the State to notify the FCC prior to any such action, and allows the FCC to intervene and file appropriate petitions for appeal. Directs the FCC to report to the Congress on the technological feasibility and practicability of permitting subscribers to authorize changes in telephone service providers by electronic means without thereby increasing the likelihood of unauthorized provider changes."
