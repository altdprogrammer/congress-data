    "text": "Automobile National Heritage Area Act of 1998 - Establishes the Automobile National Heritage Area in the State of Michigan. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to add or remove lands from the Area in response to a request from the Automobile National Heritage Area Partnership, Inc. (a nonprofit corporation established under Michigan laws). Designates the Partnership as the management entity for the Area and authorizes it to receive amounts appropriated to carry out this Act. Provides that if a management plan for the Area is not submitted to the Secretary within the time specified in this Act, the Partnership shall cease to be authorized to receive Federal funding until such a plan is submitted. Sets forth authorized uses of, and a limitation on, such funds by the Partnership. Requires the Board of Directors of the Partnership to develop and submit to the Secretary a management plan for the Area for review and approval. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and, subject to the availability of appropriations, grants to government units, nonprofit organizations, and other persons upon request of the Partnership, and to the Partnership, regarding the management plan and its implementation. Prohibits the Secretary, as a condition of the award of technical assistance or grants, from requiring any recipient of such technical assistance or a grant to enact or modify land use restrictions. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) modify, enlarge, or diminish any authority of Federal, State, or local governments to regulate any use of land under any other law or regulation; (2) grant powers of zoning or land use control to the Partnership; or (3) affect or to authorize the Partnership to interfere with the rights of any person with respect to private property or any local zoning ordinance or land use plan of the State of Michigan or a political subdivision thereof. Prohibits the Secretary from making any grant or providing any assistance under this Act after September 30, 2014. Authorizes appropriations. Limits Federal funding to 50 percent of the total cost of any activity carried out with any financial assistance or grant provided under this Act."
