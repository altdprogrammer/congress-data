    "text": "Bosnia Force Realignment Act - Prohibits the obligation of Department of Defense (DOD) funds for the ground elements of U.S. armed forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, except to the extent necessary: (1) for U.S. ground forces to protect themselves during withdrawals; (2) to support a limited number of U.S. military personnel sufficient to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities; (3) to support non-combat military personnel sufficient to advise the commanders North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) peacekeeping operations in the Republic; and (4) for the deployment of U.S. ground forces as part of NATO containment operations surrounding such countries. Directs the President to continue the planned withdrawal of American forces from the NATO Stabilization Force such that U.S. ground forces in that force or the planned multi-national successor force does not exceed specified levels for years 1998 through 2000. Prohibits the use of DOD funds for: (1) the conduct of law enforcement and police activities in the Republic, except for the training of law enforcement personnel or to prevent imminent loss of life; (2) the conduct of any activity that may jeopardize the mission of the NATO-led force in preventing armed conflict between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska (Bosnian Entities); (3) any transfer of refugees within the Republic that has as one of its purposes the acquisition of control by a Bosnian Entity of territory allocated to the other Bosnian Entity under the Dayton Peace Agreement, or that may expose U.S. armed forces to substantial risk to their personal safety; and (4) implementation of any decision to change the legal status of territory within the Republic unless expressly agreed to by all signatories to the Agreement. Directs the President to report to the Congress on progress made toward meeting the established troop drawdown limits."
