Establishes in the Highway Trust Fund the Intercity Passenger Rail Account. Transfers to the Account certain portions of the amounts attributable to taxes imposed between specified dates under provisions relating to gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuels, compressed natural gas, methanol and ethanol fuel, and nongasoline noncommercial aviation fuels. Makes amounts in the Account available to finance qualified expenses of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and each non-Amtrak State. Excludes Account payments from the gross income of payment recipients, disallows a deduction to the recipient, and reduces the basis of any property by the portion attributable to the payment."
