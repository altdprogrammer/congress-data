Directs the Secretary of Education to provide grants and related assistance to: (1) Hispanic-serving institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve Hispanic students and other low-income individuals; and (2) Hispanic-serving institutions with graduate and professional programs to improve and expand graduate and professional opportunities for Hispanic students and other students underrepresented in graduate education.
