Title II: State Emergency Medical Services Agency Participation in Certain Federal Programs - Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to include State emergency medical services agencies among the entities eligible for financial assistance with regard to telemedicine and distance learning services in rural areas.

Title III: Federal Commission for Emergency Ambulance Services - Establishes the Federal Commission for Emergency Ambulance Services to study and report to the President and the Congress on all matters relating to emergency ambulance services, including any existing or proposed Federal department or agency rules that impact such services, together with recommendations for improving such matters.
