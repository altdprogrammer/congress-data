Requires: (1) the President, with respect to the resulting savings, to reduce the discretionary spending limits under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Act) for the budget year and each outyear to reflect any such reduction; and (2) the chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the Senate and the House of Representatives to revise budget levels and adjust committee allocations under the Act to reflect the amount of such reduction."
