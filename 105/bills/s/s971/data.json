    "text": "Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1997 - Requires States to adopt water quality criteria for coastal recreation waters consistent with those published by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Directs the Administrator to conduct studies for use in developing: (1) a more complete list of potential health risks; and (2) better indicators and more expeditious methods for detecting or predicting the presence of pathogens in coastal recreational waters. Requires the Administrator to issue revised water quality criteria for pathogens in such waters that are harmful to human health. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct the Administrator to publish and revise regulations requiring monitoring of, and specifying methods to be used by States to monitor, coastal recreation waters at public beaches for compliance with water quality criteria and protection of public safety. Requires notification of local governments and the public of exceedances, or the likelihood of exceedances, of water quality criteria for such waters. Directs the Administrator to: (1) issue guidance on uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in such waters; and (2) specify the conditions under which the presence of floatable material constitutes a threat to public health and safety. Requires the Administrator to issue guidance for the delegation of State testing, monitoring, and posting programs to local government authorities. Makes State resources available to such authorities if the programs are so delegated. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to fulfill requirements under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
