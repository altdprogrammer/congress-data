Amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to direct the Secretary to develop a dairy price discovery and reporting system, which shall include: (1) collection and dissemination of weekly cheese prices; (2) technical assistance to organize a cash market alternative to the National Cheese Exchange; and (3) studies of improved volume in dairy futures trading and on creation of an electronic dairy exchange. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, to provide for oversight of cash markets affecting Federal milk marketing orders."
