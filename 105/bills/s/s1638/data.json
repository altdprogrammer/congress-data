Appropriates to the Fund the initial payment under section 102 of this Act and 75 percent of annual assessments under section 102, fines or penalties under section 103, and amounts repaid or recovered under title III. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund as repayable advances. Makes specified percentages of Fund amounts available without further appropriation for carrying out provisions of this Act, for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and for reducing the Federal debt subject to limit. Excludes amounts for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the debt from consideration for the Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and House Concurrent Resolution 67 of the 104th Congress. (Sec. 102) Requires each tobacco product manufacturer (including repackers, labelers, and relabelers) to pay annually to the Fund amounts based on that manufacturer's stock market capitalization as compared to the average stock market capitalization of all manufacturers. Mandates annual assessments on each manufacturer based on the number of specified products removed during the year. Provides for floor stock treatment. Makes the initial capitalization-based payment and any penalties under title III not tax deductible. Amends the Federal bankruptcy code regarding the priority of unsecured Federal claims for payments, assessments, or penalties to be paid into the Fund. Prohibits manufacturers from using any liability insurance to make payments into the Fund. Mandates regulations regarding placing a Healthy Kids Stamp on each tobacco product package for which an assessment has been paid. Exempts a manufacturer who has consent decrees with more than 25 States before 1998 from the initial payment and certain portions of annual payments. (Sec. 103) Establishes a tobacco manufacturer licensing program. Requires a manufacturer or importer to be licensed to manufacture, distribute, or import tobacco products and to be eligible for protections under subtitle A of title VII. Mandates, for assessment nonpayment, manufacturer and importer license ineligibility and license revocation or suspension. (Sec. 104) Imposes a minimum monetary penalty for noncompliance with section 102. Subtitle B: Payments - Chapter 1: To States - Requires that funds under section 101 be made available to reimburse each eligible State for: (1) State expenditures under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act for the treatment of individuals with tobacco-related conditions; (2) other State expenses incurred in providing treatment for tobacco-related conditions; and (3) providing funds to local governments.
