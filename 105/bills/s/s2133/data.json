Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements, accept donations, provide cost-share grants and information and technical assistance in historic preservation, and conduct research. Requires the Secretary: (1) to provide assistance in the preservation of the corridor that is compatible with the idiosyncratic nature of the highway; (2) not to prepare or require an overall management plan, but to cooperate with public and private entities in developing local preservation plans to guide efforts to protect the most important or representative resources of the corridor; (3) to develop a technical assistance program in the preservation of Route 66, including guidelines for setting priorities for preservation needs; (4) to coordinate a program of historic research, curation, preservation strategies, and collection of oral and video histories of events that occurred along the corridor designed for continuing use after the Cultural Resource Programs are terminated; (5) to make available cost-share grants for the preservation of the corridor for resources that meet the guidelines under the technical assistance program; and (6) provide information about existing cost-share opportunities.
