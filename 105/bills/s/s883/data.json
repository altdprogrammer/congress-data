Subtitle B: Nondeductible Tax-Free IRAs - Amends the Code to establish a nondeductible tax-free IRA Plus account. Sets forth related provisions. Title II: Women's Retirement Security - Amends the Code to make an individual's eligibility for deductible IRA contributions independent of spousal pension plan participation.

(Sec. 406) Amends the Code and ERISA to set forth the circumstances in which a defined contribution plan will not be treated as failing to meet requirements merely because the transferee plan does not provide some or all the forms of distribution previously available under another defined contribution plan. Title V: Pension Security - Subtitle A: Economically Targeted Investments - Expresses the sense of the Congress that economically targeted investments violate ERISA intent. (Sec. 502) Sets forth specified prohibitions on Department of Labor interpretations and activities with respect to employee benefit plan investment.
