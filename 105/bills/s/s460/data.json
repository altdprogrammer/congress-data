Adds to provisions defining the disallowance of certain expenses in connection the business use of the home to provide that a home office shall in any case qualify as the principal place of business if the office is: (1) in the location where the taxpayer's essential administrative or management activities are conducted on a regular and systematic basis; and (2) necessary because the taxpayer has no other location for the performance of the essential management or administrative activities of the business. Considers a service provider as not being an employee if the provider: (1) can realize a profit or loss, can incur unreimbursed expenses, and makes a time-limited or task-limited agreement; (2) has a principal place of business, does not primarily provide service at a single service recipient's facilities, pays fair rent for the use of the recipient's facilities, or operates primarily with equipment not supplied by the recipient; and (3) if there is a written contract providing that the provider will not be treated as an employee for Federal tax purposes. Considers (in addition) a provider as not an employee if: (1) there is such a written contract; and (2) the provider is a corporation or limited liability company and does not receive benefits that the recipient's employees receive. Regulates the treatment of determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury that a service provider should have been treated as an employee."
