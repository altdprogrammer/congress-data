Requires the Secretary to: (1) study and report to the Congress on the implementation of such incentive payment system; and (2) develop and report to the Congress on a new medical support performance measure based on State efficacy in establishing and enforcing medical support obligations. Repeals the predecessor incentive payment system. Includes among the Secretary's duties providing Federal guidance, technical assistance, and monitoring in order to ensure data reliability. Denies State eligibility for incentive payments when Federal audits find claims are based on incomplete or unreliable data."
