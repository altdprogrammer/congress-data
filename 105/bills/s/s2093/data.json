    "text": "Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a competitive Class Size Demonstration Grants program. Directs the Secretary of Education to award such grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to pay half of the costs of conducting projects that demonstrate methods of reducing class size that may provide information meaningful to other SEAs and local educational agencies (LEAs). Authorizes the Secretary to reserve up to five percent of funds for this Act for each fiscal year to carry out national evaluation and dissemination activities. Sets forth program requirements for: (1) grant selection criteria; (2) priority for projects that involve at-risk students in the earliest grades, including educationally or economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and limited English proficient students; (3) annual competitions; (4) random techniques and appropriate comparison groups; (5) applications; and (6) sufficient size and scope of projects. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct, and report to the Congress on, a national evaluation of such projects to determine the costs incurred in achieving the reduction in class size and the effects of the reductions on results; and (2) widely disseminate information about the results of such projects. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 2) Prohibits the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from carrying out research and development activities relating to the performance of aircraft (including supersonic aircraft and subsonic aircraft) unless the Administrator receives payment in full for such activities from the private sector."
