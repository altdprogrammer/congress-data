    "text": "Campaign Finance Reform and Disclosure Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit contributions to candidates for political office by any individual who is not a U.S. citizen. (Currently, such prohibition applies only to an individual who is not a U.S. citizen and who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence.) Limits acceptance of out-of-State contributions by Senate candidates. Limits reimbursement from campaigns for contributions by Senate candidates and the immediate families of Senate candidates. Restricts the use of campaign funds by Senate candidates for personal purposes. Limits congressional use of the franking privilege during a year in which there will be an election for the seat held by the member unless the member makes a public announcement that the Member will not be a candidate for election to any Federal office in that year. Decreases and indexes the multicandidate political committee contribution limit. Restricts the acceptance of contributions by political party committees. Exempts communications between a political party and members of the political party from specified spending limitations. Excludes from the definition of contribution State or local political party committee payments for certain State and local activities. Excepts from receipt and disbursement reporting requirements PACs which have accepted contributions or made expenditures aggregating less than $25,000 during an election cycle. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to revise the rights of employees relating to the payment and use of labor organization dues. Provides for expedited Supreme Court review of constitutional issues of this Act or any amendment made by this Act."
