    "text": "Public Health Funds Preservation Act - Limits attorney's fees to $125 per hour, plus out-of-pocket expenses approved by the court, for attorneys acting on behalf of a State or political subdivision of a State or other plaintiff in connection with the settlement of a State action against one or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related Medicaid expenditures or for other causes of action involved in the settlement agreement dated June 20, 1997. Prohibits the award of attorney's fees under any national tobacco settlement until the attorneys have: (1) provided to the Congress a detailed time accounting regarding the work performed; and (2) made public disclosure of such time accounting and fee arrangements. Requires each attorney whose fees are subject to this Act to submit to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees a comprehensive record of the time and expenses for which the fees are to be paid. Provides that this Act shall not be construed to limit attorney's fees paid by manufacturers of tobacco products in connection with such actions."
