Allows parents to maintain a civil action for appropriate relief if their right to gain access to such information is violated. Prohibits the availability of funds under any applicable program to an educational agency or institution that, as part of an applicable program and without the prior written informed consent of the parent of a student, requires the student to: (1) undergo medical, psychological, or psychiatric examination, testing, treatment, or immunization, except in the case of a medical emergency; or (2) reveal any information about the student's personal or family life, except to the extent necessary to comply with the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act."
