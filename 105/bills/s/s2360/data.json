Title II: NOAA Ocean and Coastal Programs - Authorizes appropriations for NOAA for: (1) ocean resources conservation and assessment; and (2) marine environmental research. (Sec. 203) Mandates establishment and maintenance of a National Undersea Research Program to increase scientific knowledge essential for the wise use and conservation of oceanic, coastal, and large lake resources. Requires its research to be conducted by regional National Undersea Research Centers. Mandates annual solicitation of research proposals. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Program Administration and Support - Authorizes appropriations for NOAA for: (1) administration and services; (2) acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operation of facilities; (3) vessel support; (4) the National Ocean Service for collection of coastal assessment data; (5) the National Marine Fisheries Service for conducting sustained fisheries scientific and survey operations; (6) the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research for conducting sustained oceanographic and atmospheric data collection; (7) ship maintenance and repair and planning for future ship capability; and (8) aircraft services. Title IV: Hydrographic Services - Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 - Lists the hydrographic duties of the NOAA Administrator. Grants related authorities, including: (1) implementing a quality assurance program and certifying hydrographic products meeting standards promulgated by the Administrator; (2) authorizing the use of the emblem or any trademark of NOAA on a certified product; and (3) charging a related fee. Declares that the Government is not liable for any negligence by a person that produces certified hydrographic products. Establishes the Hydrographic Services Account to receive the fees and other amounts as provided by law, with fees credited as offsetting collections to the Administration, Operations, Research, and Facilities account. Prohibits the Administrator from increasing any charge for hydrographic services except as authorized by this paragraph. (Sec. 405) Mandates reports to the Congress on: (1) the status of implementation of real-time tide and current data systems in U.S. ports; (2) existing safety and efficiency needs in U.S. ports that could be met by increased use of those systems; (3) a plan for expanding those systems to meet those needs; and (4) a plan to ensure that Federal competence and expertise in hydrographic surveying will be maintained after the decommissioning of the three existing NOAA hydrographic survey vessels. (Sec. 406) Authorizes appropriations for NOAA for: (1) nautical mapping and charting; (2) hydrographic surveys; (3) geodetic functions; and (4) tide and current measurement functions.

Ends the moratorium on new officer appointments. Title VI: NOAA Fleet - Mandates submission to specified congressional committees of a revised fleet modernization plan reflecting the need to continue providing NOAA with high-quality oceanic and atmospheric research information and NOAA's budget constraints. Title VII: Miscellaneous - Amends the Reorganization Plan Numbered 4 of 1970 to remove provisions establishing the position of Chief Scientist of NOAA. (Sec. 702) Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to use by agreement the personnel, services, and facilities of State and other Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities, on a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis, to carry out the purposes of title III (Marine Sanctuaries) of that Act.
