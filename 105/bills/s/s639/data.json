Requires the same distribution of arrearages collected by Federal tax intercept as collected directly by the States (namely, first to the family, and only then to the State to reimburse prior welfare expenditures). Repeals the State and Federal priority for retaining assigned child support arrearages collected from Federal tax refund offsets. Mandates that the State agency distribute such arrearages in accordance with the priorities revised under this Act."
