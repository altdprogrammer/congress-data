Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) establish minimum flight altitudes to include in the recommendations; and (2) prohibit overflights below such minimum altitudes in any national park to restore or preserve quiet. Directs the Administrator, after receipt of recommendations and notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a final plan for the management of air traffic over national parks: (1) experiencing adverse impacts associated with noise from aircraft overflights; or (2) for which air tours need to be regulated in order to prevent resource impairment from overflights."
