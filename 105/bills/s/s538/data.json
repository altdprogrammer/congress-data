Requires the first $80,000 in administrative costs of such transfer and related activities to be equally shared between the United States and the District, with any additional adminstrative costs to be paid by the United States. Requires the Secretary to transfer to the District all natural flow, waste, seepage, return flow and groundwater rights held by the United States: (1) for the benefit of the Project or the District; (2) for use on the land within the District; and (3) which are set forth in contracts between the United States and the District or in the Foster decree. Directs the Secretary to provide an allocation of storage space in Minidoka, American Falls, and Palisades reservoirs to the District in accordance with the terms of specified contracts, subject to the requirement that the District continue to assume its allocable costs of operation and maintenance associated with such storage facilities. Requires the Secretary to continue to provide the District with project reserve power from specified power plants. States that this Act shall not affect the right of Minidoka Irrigation District to joint use of the gravity portion of the Southside Canal. Requires the Secretary to complete the transfer no later than two years after the enactment of this Act. Requires a report from the Secretary to specified congressional committees on the status of the transfer, any transfer obstacles, and the anticipated transfer completion date."
