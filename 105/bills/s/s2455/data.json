    "text": "Railroad Retirement Amendment Act of 1998 - Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to preclude the canceling of annuities to certain divorced wives of workers if, through an administrative error, they received such benefits otherwise precluded by the making of a lump sum payment to a widow. Requires payment of such survivor benefits to such a divorced wife who elects to repay the lump sum payment to the Railroad Retirement Board. Authorizes the Board to: (1) withhold up to ten percent of each benefit amount paid after the date of the enactment of this Act toward such reimbursement; and (2) waive such repayment to the extent it would cause an unjust financial hardship for the beneficiary. Makes such amendment applicable to such benefits paid in the past, present, or future."
