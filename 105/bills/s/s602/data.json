    "text": "Crime Control Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for persons prosecuted in State courts for violent and drug trafficking crimes involving a firearm. Prohibits probation, suspension of sentence, concurrent sentencing, or early release for such persons. Makes this Act inapplicable to certain persons found to have committed a criminal act while acting in defense of a person or property during the course of a crime being committed by another person. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) give due deference to the interest that a State or local prosecutor has in prosecuting a person under State law; and (2) implement and enforce regulations which mandate prison work for all able-bodied inmates in Federal penal and correctional institutions and which prohibit the provision by the Government of television, radio, telephone, stereo, or similar amenities in the cell of any inmate."
