Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Title III: Dropout Prevention in the Higher Education Act of 1965 Title IV: State Responsibilities National Dropout Prevention Act of 1997 - Title I: Dropout Prevention - Amends the School Dropout Assistance Act (title V part C of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA)) to establish a coordinated national strategy and a national school dropout prevention initiative. (Sec. 101) Declares it a national priority, for the five-year period after enactment of this Act, to lower the school dropout rate, and increase school completion, for middle school and secondary school students. Requires all Federal agencies that carry out activities that serve students at risk of dropping out of school, or that are intended to help address the school dropout problem, to make school dropout prevention a top priority in the agencies' funding priorities during such period. Directs the Secretary of Education to collect systematic data on the participation of different racial and ethnic groups (including migrant and limited English proficient students) in all Federal programs. Requires the Director of the Office of Dropout Prevention and Program Completion (established by this Act) to provide for: (1) a national school dropout prevention strategy, through an interagency plan to assess coordination, use of resources, and availability of funding under Federal law that can be used to address school dropout prevention, or middle school or secondary school reentry; (2) a national clearinghouse on effective school dropout prevention, intervention and reentry programs; and (3) a national recognition program that recognizes schools that have made extraordinary progress in lowering school dropout rates. Directs the Secretary to make allotments to States for dropout prevention. Authorizes State educational agencies to use such allotment funds to award grants to public middle schools or secondary schools with dropout rates in the highest one-third of all school dropout rates in the State, to enable them to pay only the startup and implementation costs of school dropout prevention programs, including activities for professional development, curricular materials, release time for professional staff, and planning and research. Expresses the intent of Congress that the activities started or implemented with these dropout prevention grant allotment funds shall be continued with funding provided under ESEA title I part A (Helping Disadvantaged Students Meet High Standards). Limits the number, amount, and duration of such grants. Provides for: (1) strategies and allowable models; (2) selection of schools; (3) dissemination activities; (4) progress incentives; (5) school dropout rate calculation; (6) reporting and accountability; and (7) a prohibition on tracking. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to establish an Office of Dropout Prevention and Program Completion, whose Director shall report directly to the Secretary and carry out specified duties. Title II: Amendments to the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act - Amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act to direct the Secretary to establish and publish performance measures and expected levels of performance to assess the progress of each State educational agency in achieving: (1) student mastery of academic skills; (2) student mastery of vocational skill proficiencies for students in vocational education programs that are necessary for a secondary school diploma, equivalent, or skill certificate; and (3) placement in, retention in, and completion of, secondary school education and postsecondary education. Authorizes the Secretary to establish other related performance measures as well. (Sec. 202) Revises requirements for State leadership activities and local activities, adding vocational education programs for adults and school dropouts to complete their secondary school education. Title III: Dropout Prevention in the Higher Education Act of 1965 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a Trio Middle School Program, among Federal TRIO Programs (various programs of outreach to qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds) under Federal Early Outreach and Student Services Programs, to assist projects providing specified services for middle school students to make the transition to, and complete, secondary school. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 302) Prescribes additional considerations for the awarding of grants and contracts under Federal TRIO programs. (Sec. 303) Revises local coordination requirements to direct the Secretary to allow a program director to administer one or more TRIO programs. (Sec. 304) Establishes additional TRIO program requirements for: (1) coordination incentives; (2) recruiting prohibitions; (3) number of disadvantaged students served; and (4) counseling. (Sec. 305) Revises the Upward Bound program (one of the TRIO programs) to include among permissible services provision of work-study positions where youths participating in the project are exposed to careers requiring a postsecondary degree. Allows such youths to be paid summer monthly stipends. Requires Upward Bound program grant or contract recipients to plan, report, and make adjustments to projects in order to increase Upward Bound student retention rates to specified levels. (Sec. 306) Revises provisions for special programs for students whose families are engaged in migrant and seasonal farmwork. Adds requirements relating to coordination of services and data collection. Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations for such programs. Authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of such programs' funds, when they exceed a specified amount, to make grants to eligible institutions for services to migrant students, if such institutions offer in-State tuition to migrant students who are not State residents. (Sec. 307) Establishes Programs for Counseling Excellence under which the Secretary shall award grants to develop model programs for counseling excellence, including specified student counseling programs, community partnerships for tutoring and mentoring, and in-service training for guidance counselors. Requires the Secretary to collect and disseminate certain information on student counseling programs. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: State Responsibilities - Amends ESEA to require State educational agencies to comply with specified requirements with respect to school dropouts, including: (1) uniform data collection and reporting; (2) attendance-neutral funding policies; (3) development of uniform long-term suspension and expulsion policies for serious infractions; and (4) alternative educational placements for students expelled for more than ten school days per academic year."
