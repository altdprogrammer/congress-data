Prohibits the sale or transfer, issuance of an export license, or financing of the sale or export of highly advanced weapons to Latin American countries. States that this prohibition does not apply to any sale, sales, financing, or license permitted by an international agreement that provides for restraint: (1) in the purchase of highly advanced weapons by countries in Latin America; or (2) in the sale or other transfer of highly advanced weapons to countries in Latin America."
