Establishes a National Parks Trust Fund into which appropriated or credited amounts are received. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay, not less often than quarterly, specified expenditures from the Trust Fund to the Director of the National Park Service. Requires that expenditures from such Fund be used only for design, construction, rehabilitation, and repair of high priority facilities that directly enhance the experience of park visitors within the units of the National Park System. Prohibits the use of such expenditures for the purposes of land acquisition. Requires a study concerning the effects of this Act."
