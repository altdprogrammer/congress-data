Declares that, with respect to the right to life guaranteed to persons by the 5th and 14th amendments to the Constitution, the word \"person\" applies to all human beings, irrespective of age, health, function, or condition of dependency, including their unborn offspring at every stage of their biological development including fertilization. Declares that no unborn child shall be deprived of life by any person; but adds that nothing in this article shall prohibit a law allowing justification to be shown for only those medical procedures required to prevent the death of either the pregnant woman or her unborn offspring, as long as such a law requires every reasonable effort to be made to preserve both their lives."
