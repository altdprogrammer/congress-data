    "text": "Urges the President to: (1) appoint a high level task force to develop a comprehensive program for addressing domestic and international drug trafficking and drug consumption and related crimes, with particular attention to fashioning a multilateral framework for improving international cooperation in combating illegal drug trafficking; (2) designate the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy to chair the task force; (3) call upon the heads of state of major illicit drug producing, drug transit, and money laundering countries to establish similar high level task forces; and (4) call for the convening of an international summit of all interested governments to be hosted by an international organization mutually agreed to by the parties for the purpose of reviewing the findings and recommendations of the U.S. task forces and adopting a counternarcotics plan of action for each country. Makes provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, relating to annual certification procedures for assistance for drug-producing and drug-transit countries, inapplicable in 1998 and 1999. Authorizes the President to waive the applicability of such provisions in 2000 upon determining that the waiver would facilitate the enhancement of U.S. international narcotics control programs."
