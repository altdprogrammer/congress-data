Requires such increases to be the same percentage as the increase in benefit amounts payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust administratively the rates of disability compensation payable to certain persons who are not in receipt of compensation for service-connected disability or death.
