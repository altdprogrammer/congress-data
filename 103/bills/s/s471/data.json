    "text": "National Park System Reform Act of 1994 - Title I: National Park Systems Plan - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a National Park System (NPS) Plan to guide the direction of the NPS into the next century, including: (1) a statement of goals and objectives for use in defining the mission and role of the NPS; (2) detailed criteria to be used in determining which natural and cultural resources are appropriate for inclusion as NPS units; (3) identification of what constitutes adequate representation of a particular resource type and which aspects of the national heritage are adequately represented in the existing NPS or in other protected areas; (4) identification of appropriate aspects of the national heritage not currently represented; (5) priorities of the themes and types of resources which should be added to the NPS; and (6) a statement of the role of the NPS with respect to such topics as preservation of natural areas, ecosystems, industrial America, and cultural resources and provision of outdoor recreation non-physical opportunities; and (7) a statement of what areas constitute NPS units and the distinction between such units, affiliated areas, and other areas within the system. Establishes a National Park System Review Commission to review the existing NPS to determine whether there are more appropriate alternatives for managing specific units or portions of units within the NPS. Title II: New Area Establishment - Directs the Secretary: (1) to submit to specified congressional committees a list of areas recommended for study for potential inclusion in the NPS; (2) in developing such list, to give consideration to those areas that have the greatest potential to meet the established criteria of national significance, suitability, and feasibility and special consideration to themes, sites, and resources not already adequately represented in the NPS as identified in the NPS Plan; (3) to complete each such study provided for by law within three complete fiscal years after considering whether the area possesses nationally significant natural or cultural resources or outstanding recreational opportunities representing one of the most important examples of a particular resource type in the country and is a suitable and feasible addition to the NPS; and (4) to submit to specified congressional committees at the beginning of each calendar year a list of areas previously studied in numerical order of priority for addition to the NPS. Prohibits any study of the potential of an area for inclusion in the NPS from being initiated after the date of enactment of this title, except as provided by specific authorization of an Act of Congress."
