    "text": "Environmental Justice Act of 1993 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish a list, in rank order, of the total weight of toxic chemicals released in each county or other geographic unit in the most recent five-year period for which data are available. Designates the 100 counties with the highest total releases as Environmental High Impact Areas. Requires the publication of such list every five years. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Labor to conduct compliance inspections of all toxic chemical facilities in such Areas at least every two years. Delegates such authority to States or Indian tribes authorized to administer Federal laws regulating toxic chemicals. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue a report identifying the nature and extent of acute and chronic health impacts in such Areas from exposure to toxic chemicals as compared to other counties. Directs the President, if the report identifies significant adverse impacts, to report proposed administrative and legislative changes to the Congress to remedy and prevent such impacts. Includes within such remedies: (1) expansion of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 to include additional facilities or chemicals or reduced quantities of chemicals triggering reporting requirements; (2) the regulation of toxic chemicals not subject to Federal law based on a statutory or administrative exemption; and (3) the imposition of additional regulatory measures for toxic chemical facilities in such Areas. Requires the Administrator, if the report identifies significant adverse impacts, to promulgate regulations applicable to any Federal permit for construction or modification of a toxic chemical facility to require a net reduction in the release of a chemical determined to cause adverse health impacts in such an Area. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to individuals who may be threatened by toxic chemical releases in such Areas to: (1) facilitate access to the public participation process under this and other Acts; and (2) be used to obtain technical assistance relating to inspection and review authorities."
