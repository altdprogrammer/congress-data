Requires such notice to be suitable for posting and distributed to physicians, medical facilities, and others receiving grants to provide services to older individuals. Mandates direct enrollment of Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) eligibles by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to establish a toll-free telephone number for information about such cost-sharing benefit. Amends the Medicaid program to: (1) require the Secretary to develop a simplified form for applying for such cost-sharing benefit for processing at social security offices; and (2) provide for a period of presumptive eligibility for medical assistance for individuals who qualify for such cost-sharing benefit without regard to whether a final determination of eligibility for such assistance has been made. Directs the Secretary to make grants to State agencies and organizations for the provision of outreach assistance to older individuals who may be eligible for such cost-sharing benefit. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Application of Other Medicaid Eligibility Rules - Amends the Medicaid program to permit retroactive payments of medical costs incurred by certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries in or after the third month before the month in which such an individual applied for such cost-sharing benefit. Title III: Report - Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on Department activities to ensure enrollment in and full implementation of such cost-sharing program."
