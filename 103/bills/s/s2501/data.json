Sets penalties for knowingly denying medical care or services or otherwise discriminating in the provision of medical care or services to, any person because that person has: (1) undergone female circumcision; or (2) requested that female circumcision be performed on any person. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health collaborate in: (1) compiling data on the number of females living in the United States, including, specifically, the number of girls under age 18, who have been subjected to female genital mutilation (mutilation); (2) identifying communities in the United States that practice mutilation; (3) designing and carrying out outreach activities to educate individuals in the communities on the physical and psychological health effects of such practice; and (4) developing recommendations for dissemination to students of medical and osteopathic schools regarding mutilation and its complications."
