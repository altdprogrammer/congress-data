Requires such policy, at a minimum, to prohibit smoking in each portion of such a facility that is not ventilated separately. Directs the Administrator and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide technical assistance to persons who provide children's services and other persons who request it. Authorizes persons who make a good-faith effort to enforce a nonsmoking policy that meets requirements to petition their funding Federal agency for a waiver from the general requirements. Sets forth conditions for granting waivers, including that the person requesting the waiver will make a good-faith effort to enforce an alternative nonsmoking policy to protect children. Provides for special waivers for persons who provide children's services pursuant to certain collective bargaining agreements. Prescribes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Exempts from this Act's requirements registered persons providing children's services in a private residence to grandchildren, nieces, or nephews. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on information concerning compliance with this Act and an assessment of the legal status of smoking in public places."
