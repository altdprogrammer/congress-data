    "text": "Prisoner Transfer Equity Act - Urges the President to begin to negotiate prisoner transfer treaties, or renegotiate existing treaties, with countries that currently have more prisoners in U.S. prisons than there are U.S. citizens in their prisons in order to relieve overcrowding in Federal and State prisons, focusing on the transfer of illegal aliens who are serving in U.S. prisons. Requires the President to report to the Congress on the progress of such negotiations. Requires not less than one percent nor more than ten percent of U.S. assistance otherwise allocated for such country to be withheld whenever such a report indicates that no progress has been made in negotiations with a foreign country and the United States continues to maintain a surplus of prisoners who are nationals of that country. Authorizes the President to waive such provision if its application would jeopardize relationships between the United States and a foreign country that the President determines to be in the national interest. Requires the President, whenever exercising such waiver authority, to submit written justification to the Congress. Urges the President, for each country that does not receive U.S. assistance and for which the United States continues to maintain a surplus of prisoners who are nationals of that country, to use such diplomatic offices and powers as necessary to make progress in negotiating or renegotiating a prisoner transfer treaty."
