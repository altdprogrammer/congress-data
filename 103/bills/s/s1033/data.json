Directs the Secretary of the Interior to protect, manage, and administer the Battlefields for the purposes of preserving and interpreting their natural, cultural, and historic resources and of providing for public understanding and appreciation of the Battlefields in such a manner as to perpetuate these qualities and values for future generations. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands within the boundaries of the Battlefields, subject to specified requirements. (Sec. 6) Requires that the Battlefields be managed by the Secretary pursuant to this Act and the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields plan (plan) to be developed by the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields Commission (to be established under this Act) and approved by the Secretary. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to establish partnerships and enter into cooperative agreements concerning lands within the Battlefields and historic core areas with other Federal, State, or local agencies and private persons and organizations. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the Secretary: (1) within the Battlefields and historic core areas, to award grants and provide technical assistance to property owners to provide for the preservation and interpretation of the natural, cultural, and historical resources within the Battlefields and historic core areas; and (2) to award grants and provide technical assistance to governmental entities to assist with the planning, development, and implementation of comprehensive plans, land use guidelines, regulations, ordinances, or other appropriate documents that are consistent with and designed to protect the historic character of the Battlefields and historic core areas. Directs the Commission to conduct a regular review of approved plans, guidelines, regulations, ordinances, or documents (documents), and where appropriate, to recommend that the Secretary withdraw approval and suspend any grant authority pursuant to this section. Directs the Secretary to suspend grants awarded upon determining that such documents are modified in a manner that is inconsistent with the protection of the historic character of the Battlefields and historic core areas. Specifies that the Federal share of any grant made under this section shall be matched by non-Federal funds. (Sec. 10) Directs the Commission to: (1) advise the Secretary on the administration of the Battlefields; (2) assist Virginia, any political subdivision thereof, or any nonprofit organization in the management, protection, and interpretation of the natural, cultural, and historical resources within the historic core areas; and (3) take appropriate action to encourage protection of the natural, cultural, and historic resources within the Battlefields and historic core areas by landowners, local governments, organizations, and businesses.
