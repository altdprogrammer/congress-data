(Sec. 104) Authorizes the Comptroller General (CG) to make changes with regard to GAO's Office of Special Investigations that are consistent with this title. Title II: General Accounting Office Final Reports and Congressional Requests for Reports - Amends Federal law to require the CG to: (1) provide an agency of the Federal Government or the District of Columbia government relevant to a report an opportunity to review any finding of GAO in such report before it is final and released; (2) include a summary of the post-review agency response in the final report; and (3) include, to the greatest extent practicable, a list of all organizational contacts and informational sources used in each final report. (Sec. 201) Authorizes the CG to release a final report no earlier than seven days after receiving a Member of Congress' request to withhold such release. Prohibits release of a final report unless the CG includes in it a written determination that GAO has complied with all internal quality control procedures. Sets forth procedures for releasing or preparing a report upon request by committee chairmen, ranking minority members, or individual Members. Requires CG to treat all requests from committee chairmen and ranking members on an equal basis. Title III: General Accounting Office Peer Review Committee - Establishes the General Accounting Office Peer Review Committee. Lists Committee functions, which include recommending a formal process and standards for review under which agencies, and affected parties, may appeal to GAO for correction of factual errors and for reconsideration of study, audit, investigation, and report findings based on erroneous or unconsidered information. (Sec. 304) Requires the CG to implement Committee recommendations to the greatest extent practicable consistent with applicable law."
