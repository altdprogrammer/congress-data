Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to use funds in the special account to pay the Federal share of the cost of eligible projects such as the design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of a facility within the Park that meets specified guidelines. Requires the Director to enter into a cost-sharing agreement with a non-Federal Government entity for each eligible project. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the Park infrastructure improvement."
