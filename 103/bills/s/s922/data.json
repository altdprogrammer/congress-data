Prohibits such an authority from seeking or making a modification of such an order unless the authority has jurisdiction to make such a child support order and: (1) the court of the issuing State no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the order because it no longer is the child's State or the residence of any contestant; or (2) each contestant has filed written consent to that authority making the modification and assuming continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. Permits a State court that no longer has continuing jurisdiction over such orders to enforce prior orders with respect to unsatisfied obligations. Requires that the forum State's law apply in a proceeding to establish, modify, or enforce a child support order, except that in: (1) interpreting a child support order, a court shall apply the law of the State of the court that issued the order; and (2) an action to enforce a child support order, a court shall apply the statute of limitation of the forum State or the State of the court that issued the order, whichever statute provides the longer period of limitation."
