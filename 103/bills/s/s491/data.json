(Sec. 502) Requires each participating State to establish an entity to conduct quality reviews of persons providing covered services under its program which meet Federal standards for the adoption of practice guidelines, identification of outliers, development of remedial programs and monitoring for outliers, and the application of sanctions. Allows the State to adopt alternative methodologies to those adopted by the Quality Council, provided that the State can demonstrate that the efficacy of such review and education programs meets Federal standards. Mandates that the quality review entity be administratively independent of the individual or board that administers the program and not provide any financial incentive to reviewers to favor one pattern of practice over another. (Sec. 503) Permits a State program to: (1) require, as a condition of payment for institutional health care and other specified services, periodic professional certification; (2) establish a utilization review program and deny coverage and payment for services to the extent the services are determined under such a program not to meet specified coverage standards under certain circumstances; and (3) require, consistent with standards established by the Board, that payment for services exceeding specified levels or duration be provided only as consistent with a plan of care or treatment formulated by providers of the services or other qualified professionals (and such a plan may include utilization review at specified intervals as a further condition of payment for services). Directs the Board to provide for the establishment of Federal standards for utilization review programs conducted by State programs, designed to assure cost-effective and medically appropriate use of services consistent with such standards. (Sec. 504) Requires: (1) each State program to develop and use a uniform electronic data base which uses software designated by the Board and which assures confidentiality for all patient records to enable systematic quality review and outcomes analysis; and (2) the Board to designate such software and establish standards designed to protect the privacy of patients. Limits access by government agencies to patient records. Title VI: Health Security Budget; Payments; Cost Containment Measures - Subtitle A: Budgeting and Payments to States - Directs the Board to establish an American health security budget which specifies the total expenditures to be made by the Federal Government and the States for covered health care services and allocates those expenditures among the States. Prohibits such budget from exceeding the budget for the preceding year increased by the percentage increase in gross domestic product. Divides the budget into capital expenditures, administrative, and operating components. (Sec. 602) Provides for the allocation of funds in the budget by the Board to the States, based on the national average per capita costs of covered services adjusted for differences among the States in costs and the health status of populations. Permits the use of statistical models to estimate State capitation amounts. Sets forth State adjustment factors to reflect differences in relative needs for funds and directs that such factors be applied in a budget-neutral manner resulting in no change in total Federal expenditures from the national per capita average. (Sec. 603) Requires each program to submit to the Board a proposed and final annual budget broken into capital expenditure, administrative, and operating components, with the operating component broken into facility-based services, individual practitioner payments, payments to CHSOs, and payments for other items and services. Sets forth provisions regarding proposed and final budget deadlines, adjustments in allocations, and expenditure limits. (Sec. 604) Provides for programs to receive Federal funds equal to a weighted average of 86 percent of their population-based share of the budget, which the Board may adjust between 81 and 91 percent based on State economic conditions. (Sec. 605) Requires each program to provide for a process for the approval of capital expenditures to: (1) meet the need for covered health care services consistent with State budgets and the development of medical technology; (2) establish an efficient balance between the need for services and the delivery of services; and (3) expand the delivery of services in medically underserved areas. Prohibits approval of expenditures by programs to the extent that they are attributable to a capital expenditure which was subject to, but not approved under, such process. Directs the Board to specify standards for the capital approval process which meet specified requirements. Subtitle B: Payments by States to Providers - Directs that: (1) payment for operating expenses for hospital and nursing facility services under State programs be made directly to each hospital or nursing facility under an annual prospective global budget approved under the program; (2) such budgets take into account discharges by diagnosis-related group, prior expenditures, change in the consumer price index and other price indices, compensation, occupancy levels, past financial and clinical performance, training, technological changes, and incentives to maintain costs without reducing care; (3) capital expenditures be subject to prior approval; (4) a budget of a hospital or nursing facility be subject to prior review by the SHSAC and appropriate DHAC; (5) facility budgets be adjusted to reflect payments made by CHSOs; and (6) the Board promulgate regulations permitting hospitals and nursing facilities to raise funds from private sources to pay for newly constructed facilities, major renovations, and equipment. (Sec. 612) Directs that payments under a program for home health services, hospice care, home and community-based long-term care services, and certain facility-based outpatient services be based on a global budget, a capitation amount, a specified fee schedule, or an alternative prospective payment method approved by the program. (Sec. 613) Entitles every independent health care practitioner to be paid a fee for each billable covered service. Directs the Board to establish models and encourage programs to implement alternative payment methodologies that incorporate global fees for related services or for a basic group of services furnished to an individual over a period of time. Permits a program to deny payment for any service for which it did not receive a bill and supporting documentation from such a practitioner within 30 days. Requires denial of payment for any service attributable to a capital expenditure subject to approval which has not been approved. Prohibits a practitioner from imposing a charge for a service for which such payment is denied. Directs the program to establish, on a prospective basis, a payment schedule for any payment method for a class of services of practitioners, after negotiations with organizations representing the practitioners involved. Sets forth guidelines regarding such schedules based on a national relative value scale. (Sec. 614) Authorizes programs to pay CHSOs based on annual budgets or risk-adjusted capitation payments, plus an amount equal to the amount of capital expenditures approved, reduced by the costs of covered services not provided by the CHSO. Requires that, in the case of a for-profit CHSO, the total amount of capitation payments in a period be reduced by operating profit for the period less a reasonable rate of return on equity capital and that such profit be additionally limited to such amounts as the Board determines are attributable to operating efficiencies and not to any reduction of care provided. (Sec. 615) Directs that programs pay for community-based primary health services based on global budgets, basic primary care capitation amounts for enrollees, a fee schedule (under section 613), or an alternative prospective payment method approved by the program. (Sec. 616) Requires: (1) the Board to establish classifications of prescription drugs based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Prescription Drugs and to negotiate maximum prices with manufacturers; and (2) each program to pay for such drugs based on such maximum prices and to pay separate dispensing fees to pharmacies. (Sec. 617) Directs: (1) the Board to establish a list of approved durable medical equipment and therapeutic devices and equipment; and (2) State programs to pay for such items based on maximum prices determined by the Board. (Sec. 618) Requires State programs to pay for other items and services based on methodologies to be adopted by the Board, consistent with the State health security budget. (Sec. 619) Directs the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission to advise the Board concerning the approval of prospective global budgets for hospitals and nursing facilities. Renames and continues the Physician Payment Review Commission as the Practitioner Payment Review Commission. Requires the Director of the Office of Technology Assessment to provide for the appointment of a: (1) General Health Care Payment Review Commission; and (2) Long-Term Care Payment Review Commission. (Sec. 620) Directs the Board to establish model payment methodologies and other incentives to promote the provision of services in medically underserved areas. Permits programs to adjust payment amounts within their budgets to encourage provision of appropriate services in underserved areas. (Sec. 621) Authorizes programs to utilize alternative payment methodologies, provided that such methodologies do not affect the entitlement of individuals to coverage, the weighing of fee schedules to encourage an increase in the number of primary care providers, the ability of individuals to choose among qualified providers, the benefits covered under the Program, or compliance with the State health security budget. Requires States to report on the operation and effectiveness of alternative methodologies to enable the Board to evaluate the appropriateness of the alternative methodology. Subtitle C: Mandatory Assignment and Administrative Provisions - Specifies that participating providers: (1) must accept payment from a program as full payment for covered services; and (2) may not impose additional charges on patients. Permits the Board to exclude from participation and subject to civil penalties violators of such provision. (Sec. 632) Requires programs to establish: (1) procedures for reimbursing providers within 60 days of bill submission; and (2) an appeals process to handle grievances pertaining to provider payments. Title VII: Promotion of Primary Health Care; Development of Health Service Capacity; Programs to Assist the Medically Underserved - Subtitle A: Promotion and Expansion of Primary Care Professional Training - Makes the Board responsible for: (1) coordinating health professional education policies and goals to achieve national goals; (2) developing and maintaining a system to monitor the number and specialties of individuals through their health professional education, any postgraduate training, and professional practice; and (3) developing, coordinating, and promoting other policies that expand the number of primary care practitioners.
