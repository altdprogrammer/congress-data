    "text": "National Recreational Trails Act of 1994 - Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to revise State eligibility requirements with respect to national recreational trails funding to require States to agree to expend a specified amount from non-Federal sources for such trails. Repeals the current requirement that States imposing a tax on nonhighway recreational fuels reserve a reasonable estimation of such tax revenues for recreational trail use. Allows the use of certain administrative expenditures from the National Recreational Trails Trust Fund for contracting for services with other land management agencies. Limits to one the number of national surveys of non-highway recreational fuel consumption by State that may be paid for out of such Fund. Requires States, in the mandatory use of specified amounts from such Fund for motorized or non-motorized recreation, to give priority, to the extent practicable, to project proposals that provide for the redesign, reconstruction, maintenance, or relocation of trails in order to mitigate the impact to the natural environment. Authorizes States to apply for exemption from motorized or non-motorized recreation fund use requirements if they have determined, based on trail needs identified in the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan, that it is in their best interests to be exempt. Authorizes appropriations. Increases from 11 to 12 the number of members of the National Recreational Trails Advisory Committee. Requires such committee to include one member appointed by the Secretary of the Interior representing individuals with disabilities. Rescinds specified unobligated FY 1994 appropriations."
