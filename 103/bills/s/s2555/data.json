Provides that the Units will be dedicated to finding the cause, prevention, and cure of chronic inflammatory diseases of suspected infectious etiology and committed to giving priority to diseases like arthritis and chronic lung disease which hold the most promise for beneficial research results. Requires the establishment of the Units to be based upon past research performance of researchers working on specific microorganisms. Makes the Units responsible for: (1) evaluation of patient specimens for the presence of infectious agents; (2) characterization of the immune response to these infectious agents; and (3) characterization of the genetic background of patients. Sets forth provisions regarding personnel, laboratory support, networking, and the initial period of grant funding. Makes NIAID the lead agency. Apportions responsibility for various aspects of the research program and development of a strategic research plan. Authorizes appropriations."
