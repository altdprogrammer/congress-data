Requires the Secretary, through the Director, to assist such managers and other workers in such use by: (1) establishing an information clearinghouse on the best available training material and services; (2) encouraging U.S. providers of such technologies for manufacturing firms to develop training material specifically designed for the managers and other workers responsible; and (3) establishing the availability of such specifically designed training material as an important criterion in assessing such technologies. Authorizes appropriations for a technology training clearinghouse."
