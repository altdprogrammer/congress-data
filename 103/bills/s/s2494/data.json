Sets criminal penalties for knowingly sending through the mails any unverified identification document which bears a birth date showing the individual named to be 21 years of age or older when in fact that individual has not attained age 21. Directs the Attorney General to establish a pilot program on the use of certain drivers' licenses as documents establishing both employment authorization and identity, subject to specified requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
