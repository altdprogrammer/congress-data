    "text": "Commercial Mortgage Capital Availability Act of 1993 - Sets forth a regulatory scheme under which qualified insured depository institutions meeting prescribed reserve and capital requirements may execute mortgage loan transfers with a recourse arrangement. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to modify the definition of \"mortgage related security\" to include notes directly secured by a first lien on real estate with commercial structures located upon it (thus bringing such securities within the purview of the Act). Directs the Secretary of Labor to exempt commercial mortgage related securities transactions from: (1) certain restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; and (2) certain taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code."
