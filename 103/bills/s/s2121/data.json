    "as": "Reported to Senate amended",

    "text": "National Park Service Entrepreneurial Management Reform Act of 1994 - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to increase fees for admission to units of the National Park System (NPS) and other specified areas. Makes receipts from admission available, subject to appropriation, for authorized resource protection, rehabilitation, and conservation projects. Revises provisions regarding the issuance of lifetime admission permits, including a limitation that such a permit entitles only the permittee to free admission. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress identifying areas where the Secretary recommends that the establishment of admission fees would be appropriate but where such fees are prohibited by law, and areas where such fees are authorized but not being collected. Increases the penalty for violations of rules and regulations regarding admission and special recreation use fees. Modifies provisions regarding the use of fees collected. Requires that specified receipts be covered into a special National Park Renewal Fund. Makes such funds available for infrastructure needs at parks. Directs the Secretary to develop procedures for the use of amounts in the Fund. Repeals a requirement that qualified public or private entities selling annual admission permits reimburse the United States for the full amount to be received from the sale of such permits when or before the agency delivers the permits to such entity for sale. Directs the Secretary to establish reasonable fees for uses of NPS units that require special arrangements. Prohibits charging an admission or recreation use fee for entrance into, or use of, any federally owned area operated and maintained by a Federal agency which is used for outdoor recreation purposes, except as provided for by such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) negotiate and enter into agreements with State or local governments, individuals, or other entities for the purpose of sharing costs or services in carrying out authorized functions and responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to NPS units; and (2) provide, subject to appropriation, the Federal funding share from any funds available to the NPS in carrying out such agreements. Provides for cost recovery by the United States for damage to NPS resources."
