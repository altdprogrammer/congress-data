    "text": "Credit Crunch Relief Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exempt from certain loan documentation review requirements a loan to a small business or small farm that is identified by an eligible depository institution as a qualifying loan. Provides loan limitation amounts for such qualifying loans, allowing for certain adjustments. Directs the President to: (1) conduct a thorough review and evaluation of all statutory and regulatory provisions affecting insured depository institutions; and (2) if determined appropriate, suspend the applicability of any Federal law or regulation or guideline promulgated by a Federal banking agency affecting such insured depository institutions. Requires Federal Register publication of such an order, as well as congressional notification. Prohibits a new regulation from being promulgated by a Federal banking agency until the agency has conducted a regulatory impact analysis and arrived at certain positive conclusions with respect to the costs and benefits of such regulation. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to presume compliance with meeting credit needs for a regulated financial institution that has received satisfactory or outstanding ratings in its most recent written evaluation. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 to extend until January 1, 1996, the required promulgation of final standards for insured depository institution operational and managerial safety and soundness. Requires each Federal banking agency to: (1) conduct a survey of financial services users to determine awareness and benefits of Federal banking laws; and (2) report to specified congressional committees on survey results."
