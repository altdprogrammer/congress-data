    "text": "Stagecoach Reservoir Project Act of 1993 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct appropriate investigations regarding a specified loan contract entered into under the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956. Authorizes the Secretary to sell the contract to, or accept prepayment on it from, the Upper Yampa Water Conservancy District in Colorado for the Stagecoach Reservoir Project. Requires any negotiated agreement related to such contract to provide a payment to the Federal Government calculated by discounting the remaining payments due on the loans by the interest rate determined by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to obtain approval from the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget of the final terms of any loan sale or prepayment made pursuant to this Act. Provides that upon receipt of the specified payment for the loan contract: (1) the District's obligation under the loan contract shall be terminated; (2) the Secretary shall convey all Federal right and interest in the Stagecoach Reservoir Project to the District; and (3) the District shall absolve the United States of any liability associated with the Stagecoach Reservoir Project. Terminates the authority granted by this Act to sell loans two years after the enactment of this Act. Gives a borrower at least 60 days to respond to any prepayment offer made by the Secretary."
