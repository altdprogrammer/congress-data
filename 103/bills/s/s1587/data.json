(Sec. 1002) Revises competition requirements, among other changes prohibiting purchase or contract class considerations by subject agencies in determining whether the exclusion of a particular source of covered items from competition in procurements to establish alternative sources of supply will result in reduced costs and increased competition or be in the interest of national defense. (Sec. 1003) Revises certain qualifying circumstances for award of contracts between $100,000 and $1 million under noncompetitive procedures. (Sec. 1004) Repeals expiring authority for the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to enter into master agreements and issue task orders. Creates new authority for the head of a subject agency to: (1) enter into task and delivery order contracts for procurement of services or property; and (2) appoint a task and delivery order ombudsman for reviewing complaints involving multiple contracts. (Sec. 1005) Provides for procurement of expert services for court or administrative proceedings. (Sec. 1011) Revises solicitation requirements, among other changes requiring the head of a subject agency to: (1) include cost or price as a factor to be considered in evaluating competitive proposals; and (2) disclose certain information to offerors on the importance of other evaluation factors in relation to cost and price. (Sec. 1012) Relocates provisions concerning purchase option evaluation. (Sec. 1013) Modifies notice requirements, providing, among other changes, for notice by electronic means. (Sec. 1014) Provides, under certain conditions, for: (1) debriefings furnishing unsuccessful offerors certain basic information on the contract award; and (2) protest files affording offerors reasonable access in protests to the Comptroller General (CG). (Sec. 1016) Authorizes the head of a subject agency to: (1) take certain actions, such as issuing a new solicitation or terminating a contract, if, in connection with a protest, a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with the law; and (2) pay certain costs involved in the protest, including reasonable attorney's fees, subject to prescribed limitations. (Sec. 1021) Eliminates: (1) certain restrictions on cost and incentive contracts; and (2) annual reports by DOD advocates for competition. (Sec. 1022) Revises and reorganizes provisions for multi-year contracting. Part II: Civilian Agency Acquisitions - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA) to make changes similar to those in part I above with respect to civilian agencies. Provides for: (1) solicitations for contracts to be awarded using sealed bid procedures; (2) multi-year contracts for the acquisition of property and services; (3) contracts for procurements of severable services for periods crossing fiscal years; (4) regulations governing Economy Act purchases; and (5) systems for collecting and evaluating appropriate data on procurements conducted under such regulations. Part III: Acquisitions Generally - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (OFPPA) to: (1) require establishment of policies and procedures for encouraging the consideration of past contract performance in selecting contractors; (2) require the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (Administrator) to prescribe for executive agencies guidance regarding such consideration; (3) repeal certain congressional reporting requirements on executive agency contract competition; and (4) direct the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) to promulgate regulations to discourage the use of nonstandard contract clauses on a repetitive basis. Subtitle B: Truth in Negotiations - Part I: Armed Services Acquisitions - Amends Federal law (Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA)) to revise cost or pricing data requirements to: (1) repeal the sunset date for the requirement that offerors submit cost or pricing data for prime contracts above the $500,000 threshold (thus making it permanent); (2) provide for periodic inflation adjustments in such threshold; (3) repeal certain provisions concerning modification of contracts; and (4) make changes in exceptions to data submission requirements. (Sec. 1203) Modifies provisions for submission of cost or pricing data in cases where such submission is not otherwise required, but determined necessary for determining price reasonableness, adding authority to require the submission of other data for such purposes when certified cost or pricing data is not required to be submitted.
