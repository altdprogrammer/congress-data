Amends the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990 to allow certain grants to be issued for community schools demonstration programs. Community Schools Demonstration Program Act of 1993 - Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to establish the community schools demonstration program. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to award up to ten demonstration grants to community-based organizations to assist eligible communities located within economically distressed areas to develop and conduct programs to increase students' academic success and improve work force readiness. Requires peer review panels, non-Federal share (including some private or nonprofit sources), and evaluation. Authorizes appropriations."
