Outlines the requirements to be imposed on executive agencies through such regulations, including the requirement that each such agency reserve a specified percentage of its FY 1995 through 1998 appropriations for R&D activities to be conducted by the Black colleges it must designate under this Act as federally funded R&D centers. Increases such set-aside on a graduated basis for such fiscal years. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress annually on the activities of executive agencies in carrying out this Act."
