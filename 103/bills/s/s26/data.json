Defines imported property income as that from: (1) manufacturing, producing, growing, or extracting imported property; (2) the sale, exchange, or other disposition of imported property; or (3) the lease, rental, or licensing of imported property. Requires the separate application of the limitation on the foreign tax credit on imported property income. Applies the look-thru rules in the case of controlled foreign corporations to such income."
