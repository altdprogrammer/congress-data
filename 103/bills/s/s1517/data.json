    "text": "Marine Biotechnology Investment Act of 1993 - Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a National Marine Biotechnology Strategy for the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive research and development effort to assist the Nation in understanding and using marine biotechnology. Requires the submission of the Strategy to the President and Congress within one year after the date of enactment of this Act and a revised Strategy at least once every three years thereafter. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to maintain, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a balanced program of marine biotechnology activities. Prohibits the Secretary from conducting: (1) activities that may involve the release of organisms, unless such activities have been reviewed and approved under other applicable Federal law or are found to pose no significant environmental risk (and in the case of an intentional release of organisms, the Secretary may make such a finding only after providing notice and an opportunity for public comment); and (2) research or awarding a grant for marine biotechnology applications intended to promote or enhance farming, ranching, or other forms of captive cultivation (other than hatchery enhancement of wild stocks) of any species of Pacific salmon. Amends the National Sea Grant College Program Act to establish a program to further research, development, education, and technology transfer in marine biotechnology. Provides for the establishment of a Marine Biotechnology Review Panel. Authorizes appropriations."
