    "text": "Bonneville Power Administration Refinancing Act - Amends the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act to prescribe guidelines under which the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is directed to refinance a certain appropriated debt by establishing: (1) a new principal amount for such debt; (2) new interest rates for such debt based on long-term Treasury rates in effect as of the date the principal is reset; and (3) a $100 million limit on prepayments of old capital investments before a certain date. States that certain claim settlement payments made by the Administrator to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation shall be credited against BPA payments made to the Treasury. Directs the Administrator to offer to include provisions in future electric power service contracts that preclude further increases in the principal amount or interest rate obligations to the Government."
