    "text": "Lakes Assessment and Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) conduct a comprehensive research program concerning U.S. lakes; and (2) appoint a Lake Research Advisory Committee. Requires States to designate the use of each publicly-owned lake consistent with the following uses: (1) public drinking water supply; (2) swimming and related body contact recreation; and (3) resource protection. Directs the Administrator to: (1) publish water quality criteria for lakes; and (2) publish guidance to assist States in the adoption of lake water quality standards for contaminants for which criteria documents have been published. Authorizes States to apply for grant assistance to carry out certain lake protection and pollution control activities. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such grants through FY 2000. Revises requirements for lake water quality demonstration programs. Adds to the priority list for such programs China Lake and Sebago Lake, Maine. Requires the Administrator to issue regulations prohibiting the distribution for sale within the United States of household laundry detergents containing more than 0.5 percent phosphorus by weight. Requires priority consideration to be given to watersheds of impaired lakes in soil conservation programs of the Department of Agriculture. Makes watersheds of such lakes eligible for enrollment in a specified agricultural water quality protection program. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire easements for cropland located within watersheds of impaired lakes. Requires the Secretary to designate such watersheds as conservation priority areas. Requires the Administrator to implement a national education program on lake quality and protection. Provides for a Lake Watch Program and a Lake Watch Award. Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to require the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force to undertake a program to prevent the dissemination of Eurasian Milfoil (Myriophyllum Spicatum), a type of aquatic weed. Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the importation of such species into the United States. Authorizes appropriations."
