    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1993-06-22", 
    "text": "Responsible Environmental Management Act of 1993 - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to disallow indirect costs incurred by an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contractor if a cost submitted is unallowable because it is in violation of a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or other law. Applies this requirement to contracts in excess of $1 million, other than fixed-price contracts without cost incentives. Authorizes penalties to be imposed against contractors who submit unallowable costs. Provides for hearings on penalties prior to assessment. Lists unallowable costs as costs of: (1) entertainment, gifts, or recreation for contractor employees; and (2) travel, unless otherwise allowable under the Act or supported by detailed documentation. Provides criminal penalties for knowing submissions of unallowable costs. Permits EPA to enter into an umbrella contract only if the contract: (1) does not exceed five years (ten years for a response action contract or a longer period under unusual and compelling circumstances); (2) is awarded pursuant to competitive procedures, except under specified conditions; and (3) does not authorize the contractor to procure items on behalf of the Federal Government, other than items procured under response action contracts. Defines an \"umbrella contract\" as a contract that: (1) provides for the performance of specific advisory and assistance services but does not procure or specify a firm quantity of services; (2) provides for services to be supplied in response to Federal task orders; (3) requires the contractor to provide a stated amount of effort over a given period of time; and (4) has a maximum potential value of at least $1 million and a maximum potential period of performance that is longer than one year. Lists subcontracting requirements. Requires the Administrator to establish: (1) a Deputy Assistant Administrator for Information Systems Coordination; and (2) an Office of Superfund Contract Integrity."
