Directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake an expedited validity review of all unpatented mining claims located within the Bodie Bowl. Prescribes limitations for the issuance of patents for mining and mill site claims on such lands. Subjects mineral exploration, mining, beneficiation, and processing on unpatented mining claims within the Bodie Bowl to regulations prescribed to ensure that such activities do not adversely affect historic, cultural, recreational, and natural resource values of the Bodie Bowl. Mandates reclamation of the effects of mining exploration by mining operators. Exempts the holder of any unpatented mining or mill site claim within the Bodie Bowl from specified statutory expenditure and filing requirements. Declares that, in lieu of filing a certain affidavit of assessment work, such holder shall only be required to file a specified notice of intention to hold certain mining claims. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review possible actions to preserve specified characteristics of the Bodie Bowl; and (2) report to certain congressional committees recommendations to achieve such preservation."
