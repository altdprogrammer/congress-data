Requires that the dam, upon completion of rehabilitation work, be placed under the program and be regularly maintained pursuant to program guidelines. Specifies that work authorized by this Act shall be for the purposes of dam safety operation and maintenance and not to provide additional conservation storage capacity or to develop benefits beyond those provided by the original dams and reservoirs."
