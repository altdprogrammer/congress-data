    "text": "Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to direct the Resolution Trust Corporation to: (1) determine the aggregate amounts expended in providing assistance for case resolutions during a certain time period for federally insured State savings associations; and (2) apportion those amounts among the States according to a specified formula reflecting their respective contributions to the cost of resolving State-chartered thrifts since 1988 (thus resulting in higher contributions from high-risk States). Requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to terminate the deposit insurance for State depository institutions located in any State which fails to pay the required contributions."
