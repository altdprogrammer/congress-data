Makes this Act inapplicable to the transfer or possession of a weapon: (1) by a Federal or State agency; (2) that was lawfully possessed before this Act's enactment or, in the case of a semiautomatic firearm designated as a semiautomatic assault weapon under this Act, before the designation is made; or (3) by a licensed manufacturer or importer for purposes of authorized testing or experimentation. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a rifle, pistol, or shotgun that is a semiautomatic firearm and meets specified criteria as a semiautomatic assault weapon. Makes it unlawful to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device except in connection with activities parallel to those listed for the possession or transfer of semiautomatic assault weapons. Requires the serial numbers of such weapons or devices to clearly show if they were manufactured or imported after this Act's effective date."
