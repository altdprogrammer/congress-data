Modifies the method of determining the depreciation deduction for certain personal property placed in service after June 30, 1993. Eliminates the depreciation adjustment for computing adjusted current earnings for such property. Subtitle B: Investment in Small Business - Increases the dollar limitation, with an inflation adjustment, on the deduction for expensing depreciable business assets. Subtitle C: Increased Savings Through Individual Retirement Accounts - Removes the limitation on the retirement savings deduction for active participants in certain pension plans. Provides a cost-of-living adjustment for such deduction. Allows individuals to establish individual retirement plus accounts with tax treatment similar to that for individual retirement plans. Makes contributions to such accounts nondeductible. Allows distributions from certain retirement plans without penalty to purchase first homes, pay higher education expenses and financially devastating medical expenses, and assist certain unemployed individuals. Treats certain disaster victims as first-time homebuyers. Requires contributions to an individual retirement plan (other than an individual retirement plus account) to be held for five years prior to distribution. Subtitle D: Incentives for Private Businesses to Hire New Employees - Allows employers a refundable credit for the employment taxes paid on the qualified wages of new employees hired during July 1, 1993, and June 30, 1994. Repeals the luxury excise tax on passenger vehicles, boats, aircraft, jewelry, and furs. Exempts from such tax parts for accessories installed for use on passenger vehicles by disabled individuals. Provides for the treatment of rental and nonrental real estate activities under the limitation on losses from passive activities. Title II: Deficit Reductions - Subtitle A: Extension of the Caps on Discretionary Spending - Reduces discretionary spending limits for the defense, international, and domestic categories for FY 1993 through 1995. Establishes the level of such limits for FY 1996 through 1998. Subtitle B: Spending Cuts - Rescinds a specified amount of budgetary resources for Federal administrative expenses. Eliminates the lump sum retirement benefit for Federal employees unless such employees have a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition. Requires employers to report group health plan information on wage forms. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to establish a data bank for the collection of information on Medicare secondary payer situations and health insurance information. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the reductions in discretionary spending required by this Act be achieved by reducing, modifying, eliminating, closing, or terminating specified Federal programs."
