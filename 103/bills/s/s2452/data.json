Directs the Secretary to establish a State Health Reform Advisory Board to monitor the status and progress achieved under waivers and to promote information exchange between States and the Federal Government. Requires the Board to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to minimizing the negative effect of State waivers on national employer groups, provider organizations, and insurers because of differing State requirements under waivers. Permits the Secretary to revoke any waiver of Federal law granted under this subtitle and to terminate any alternative State health program for good cause. Authorizes grants to States for carrying out alternative State health programs.

(Sec. 3002) Authorizes appropriations for grants to States for evaluating the extent to which clinical preventive services, health promotion and unintentional injury prevention activities, and interpersonal and community violence prevention activities achieve health care cost reductions and health status improvement. Directs the Secretary to issue practice guidelines that are based on the results of such evaluations. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) scholarships and loan repayment programs for individuals attending schools of public health; (2) grants to expand the capacity of certain educational institutions with public health programs; (3) grants to expand public health training programs in States lacking adequate programs; (4) area health education centers and health education training centers; (5) activities regarding centers for the prevention and treatment of poisoning and control of poisons; (6) certain school-related health services; (7) grants to migrant and community health centers; (8) the National Health Service Corps; (9) satellite clinics to provide primary health care; and (10) community health advisor programs.
