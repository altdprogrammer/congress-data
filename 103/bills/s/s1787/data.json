Describes such account as a trust created pursuant to a State educational savings plan and used exclusively to pay the higher education expenses of the designated beneficiary. Treats such State plans as tax-exempt organizations and treats contributions to such plans as charitable contributions. Declares that contributions to such accounts are not subject to the gift tax. Imposes penalty taxes in connection with reporting requirements or prohibited transactions associated with an account. Excludes distributions from such accounts when determining support for dependents."
