Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to pay for non-Federal employees to evaluate or analyze proposals submitted for an acquisition, unless Federal employees with adequate training and capabilities to perform such activities are not readily available within the agency or any other Federal agency. Sets forth requirements for the delegation of procurement authority for certain acquisitions in special circumstances. Directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to provide guidance and promulgate regulations on what actions agencies must take to determine whether expertise is readily available within the Government and how it may be shared before they contract for advisory and technical services to conduct acquisitions."
