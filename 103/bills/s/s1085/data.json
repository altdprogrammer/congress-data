Transfers: (1) ACDA policy formulation functions concerning arms control and disarmament to the Secretary of State; and (2) nonproliferation, evaluation, and verification functions to the Secretary of Defense. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to empower the National Security Council to serve as the principal adviser to the President for the interagency coordination of U.S. arms control and disarmament policy and for monitoring international arms control and disarmament agreements. Bars actions from being taken under this or any law that will obligate the United States to disarm or reduce or limit the armed forces or armaments, except pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President or unless authorized by further affirmative legislation. Creates an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Non-Proliferation Affairs. Sets forth administrative provisions concerning transfers of functions, personnel, and continuance of proceedings."
