Title I: School-to-Work Opportunities Basic Program Components - Requires School-to-Work Opportunities (SWO) programs to: (1) integrate work-based and school-based learning and academic and occupational learning, and establish effective linkages between secondary and postsecondary education; (2) provide students with the opportunity to complete career majors; and (3) incorporate specified program components including work-based and school-based learning and connecting activities. (4) provide participating students with experience in and understanding of the industry they are preparing to enter; and (5) provide all students equal access to program components and to recruitment, enrollment, placement, and related activities. Title II: School-to-Work Opportunities System Development and Implementation Grants to States - Subtitle A: State Development Grants - Authorizes the Secretaries to award development grants to applicant States to complete development of a comprehensive, statewide SWO system. (Such development may have begun with funds awarded under the Job Training Partnership Act and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.) (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretaries to make such development grants to consortia of congressional districts with low population densities, without limiting the ability of a State to carry out a statewide SWO system even if a congressional district in such State participates in such a consortium. Subtitle B: State Implementation Grants - Allows States to apply to the Secretaries for competitive implementation grants, with applications containing: (1) plans for comprehensive, statewide SWO systems meeting content requirements; (2) descriptions of how funds will be allocated to local SWO partnerships; (3) optional requests for waivers of certain statutory or regulatory requirements; and (4) a description of State collaboration with the private sector in developing the application. Title III: Federal Implementation Grants to Partnerships - Authorizes the Secretaries to award competitive SWO implementation grants to partnerships in States that have not received State implementation grants or that are carrying out initial year grant activities. (Sec. 303) Authorizes the Secretaries to award competitive grants to partnerships to implement SWO programs in: (1) high poverty areas; and (2) congressional districts with low population densities. (Such funds may be awarded in combination with funds appropriated for the Youth Fair Chance Program.) Title IV: National Programs - Directs the Secretaries to provide for: (1) research, demonstration, and other projects; (2) performance outcomes and evaluation, in collaboration with States; and (3) training and technical assistance, including establishment of a Clearinghouse and Capacity Building Network. Title V: General Provisions - Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) State requests and responsibilities for waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements; (2) such waivers by each of the Secretaries; (3) program requirements, including nondisplacement of current workers; (4) program sanctions; (5) acceptance of gifts; (6) State authority; (7) no individual entitlement to services; and (8) a combination of Federal funds for high poverty schools and by States. (Sec. 508) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1995 through 1999 for the SWO program. (Sec. 513) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Congress should fund programs under this Act for FY 1996 through 2002 predominantly from savings resulting from the efforts of the Departments of Education and of Labor and other Federal agencies to eliminate, consolidate, or streamline duplicative or ineffective education of job training programs. Title VI: Other Programs - Amends the Tech-Prep Education Act to revise tech-prep education program contents to include the two or four years of secondary school preceding graduation (currently just the final two years), as well as two years of higher education or an apprenticeship program. (Sec. 601) Gives special consideration to applications developed in consultation with institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees (among other special consideration factors). Gives highest priority to applications that provide for effective employment placement activities or transfer of students to four-year baccalaureate programs. Title VII: Technical Provisions - Sets forth effective date and sunset provisions. Title VIII: Alaska Native Art and Culture - Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development Act - Amends the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 to include Alaska Natives in a program for native culture and arts development (currently such program is only for Native Hawaiians)."
