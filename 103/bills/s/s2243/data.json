Authorizes use of unobligated balances of the Fishermen's Guaranty Fund and the Fishermen's Protective Fund and, if those are insufficient, authorizes appropriations. Repeals the statutory formula used to fix the related fees collected by the Secretary of State. Extends the Act's effective date from October 1, 1993, to October 1, 2000."
