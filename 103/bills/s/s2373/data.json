Title III: Navigation Safety and Waterway Services Management - Amends the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to increase the amounts transferred from State fish restoration and management project appropriations for grants for recreational boating safety programs. Revises funding from the same appropriations for grants to coastal and inland States for: (1) the construction and renovation of pumpout stations and waste reception facilities; and (2) education of recreational boaters about the problems of human body waste discharges from vessels.

(Sec. 302) Authorizes eligible States to submit plans for the construction and renovation of public facilities for transient nontrailerable vessels to the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes grants for such purposes. (Sec. 303) Repeals a provision requiring the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to collect and pay to the Treasury the same fees for the inspection of foreign vessels carrying passengers from the United States that a foreign country charges U.S. vessels trading to the ports of that country. (Sec. 304) Increases civil penalties for violations regarding documentation of vessels. Revises Federal provisions to make a vessel and its equipment liable to seizure by, and forfeiture to, the U.S. Government when: (1) the owner of the vessel or representative of the owner knowingly falsifies or conceals a material fact or makes a false statement or representation about the documentation when applying for documentation of the vessel; (2) a certificate of documentation is knowingly and fraudulently used for a vessel; (3) a vessel is operated after its endorsement has been denied or revoked; (4) a vessel is employed in a trade without an appropriate trade endorsement; (5) a documented vessel with only a recreational endorsement is operated other than for pleasure; or (6) a documented vessel is placed under the command of a person who is not a U.S. citizen. (Sec. 305) Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to make persons who fail to comply with regulations issued by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating liable for a civil penalty. (Sec. 306) Requires uninspected commercial fishing industry vessels that operate beyond three nautical miles from the Great Lakes coastline to be equipped with alerting and locating equipment. (Sec. 308) Considers the knowing alteration of lifesaving, fire safety, or other specified equipment such that the equipment is rendered defective to be a class D felony. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in Thacher Island to the Town of Rockport, Massachusetts, except that the Coast Guard shall retain all right, title, and interest in any historical artifact. Conditions such conveyance on the maintenance of specified navigation functions by the United States.

Provides that all vessel income and expense will, after registry transfer, continue to be reported as income and taxed in the United States as if the vessels's registry had not been transferred.

(Sec. 502) Sets forth a formula for the allocation of State recreational boating safety program funds based upon State adoption of prohibitions on the operation of recreational vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. (Sec. 503) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to submit to specified congressional committees a plan to increase reporting of vessel accidents to State law enforcement officials. (Sec. 504) Declares that persons who operate a recreational vessel in violation of this Act may be ordered to complete an approved recreational boating safety course.

Increases penalties for an individual in charge of a vessel for failing to report a casualty. (Sec. 604) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress on: (1) the adequacy and effectiveness of manning of towing vessels and progress made in implementing improvements in towing vessel operator licensing requirements; and (2) the feasibility of establishing a differential global positioning satellite navigation system and creating electronic charts for U.S. inland waterways. Title VII: Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships Amendments - Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue a certificate attesting to the adequacy of garbage reception facilities at a port or terminal only if an inspection has been conducted prior to the issuance of a certificate. (Sec. 702) Makes such certificates valid for a period of five years unless there is a change of operator. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require the operators of ports or terminals subject to MARPOL Protocol (the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973) requirements relating to reception facilities to post placards stating that users should report facility inadequacies to the Secretary. Requires all vessels to display placards and conduct briefings that notify the crew and passengers of requirements of Annex V of the Convention. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse or revoke certain permits to proceed or depart of foreign vessels in violation of MARPOL requirements. Provides for a toll-free telephone number for reporting MARPOL violations. (Sec. 703) Amends the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 to direct the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to report to the Congress on potential improvements of the waste management practices at port facilities. Expresses the sense of the Congress that certain shipper insurance policies should not provide for the payment of penalties under the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Requires persons in charge of vessels to include information on the disposal of onboard waste in the notice of arrival to the port. Direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a Marine Debris Coordinating Committee."
