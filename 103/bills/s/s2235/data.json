Authorizes the Administrator to expedite the processing of any loan application or servicing action submitted by a development company so designated. Suspends or revokes such designation upon certain determinations by the Administrator. Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator to establish an Accredited Loan Packagers Pilot Program under which loan packagers shall be designated as accredited loan packagers upon meeting certain requirements with respect to loan packaging under the SBA guaranteed loan program. Requires at least ten but no more than 15 loan packagers to be so designated. Authorizes the Administrator, during a three-year period, to expedite the processing of any loan application or servicing action prepared by a loan packager so designated. Suspends or revokes such designation upon certain determinations by the Administrator."
