    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1994-10-05", 
    "text": "Federal Disaster Preparedness and Response Act of 1994 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and other specified Federal law to establish a new framework for Federal, State, and local government and volunteer agency preparedness for and response to major disasters and emergencies. (Sec. 5) Requires the President, acting through the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to develop a Presidential Response Plan to provide, when requested, Federal emergency or disaster assistance to a State. Requires the Director to develop standard operating procedures to accompany such Plan describing chains of command, Federal agency duties, and the relationship between them and those of the State and local governments and private relief agencies involved. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the assets of the National Disaster Medical System are fully integrated into the Plan. Requires the Director to review the role of the adjutant generals of the States and the National Guard in preparing for and responding to emergencies and disasters. Declares that it is the policy of Congress that the States are encouraged to enter into interstate and regional compacts to facilitate the mutual use of National Guard assets across State borders in such events. Requires the President, acting through the Director, to direct all appropriate Federal agencies to inventory Federal disaster resources for a list of resources available to each State upon request. Requires the Director to establish: (1) a system coordinated with private relief agencies to use disaster volunteers to carry out priority disaster response services; and (2) a system to manage goods donated to the Federal Government to assist disaster victims. (Sec. 6) Authorizes a Federal agency, under the Director's direction, when an imminent disaster event is determined, to take necessary action to prepare to provide Federal assistance to State and local governments and to disaster victims. (Sec. 7) Requires the President to establish a Domestic Crisis Monitoring Unit, headed by the Vice President or any official within the Executive Office of the President, to monitor potential catastrophic disasters, notify the President and Federal agencies of them, and ensure effective, coordinated, and rapid Federal agency response in their aftermath. (Sec. 8) Requires the Director to establish: (1) disaster assessment teams to be deployed at a disaster or emergency area to survey the extent of the damage and the resulting Federal assistance needs; and (2) a targeted emergency grant program for paying the Federal share of enabling State and local governments to prepare for and respond to major disasters and emergencies. Requires the Director to establish: (1) performance standards to determine eligibility and application procedures for a grant award; as well as (2) a compliance system defining the Federal share of the costs of eligible assistance for a State not in compliance with such performance standards. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 9) Apportions Federal responsibility for disaster costs at 100 percent for the first 72 hours after the declaration to sustain life or protect property, and at not less than 75 percent after such period. Requires the Secretary of Defense, upon the request of FEMA with the concurrence of the affected State, to provide to persons adversely affected by the disaster response services not otherwise available from State, local, or volunteer agencies. (Sec. 11) Mandates a review of FEMA's structure to ensure that it can implement an all hazards approach to disaster management, use previously dedicated defense-related resources for disasters, promote coordination between all FEMA offices and directorates, and provide for rapid response, efficient delivery of services, and technical monitoring support to the States by the Regional Offices. Requires that FEMA officials be appointed on the basis of professional qualifications, such as experience in emergency and disaster management. (Sec. 12) Requires the National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control, and the Emergency Management Institute, operated by FEMA, to provide education for all hazards emergency management and response. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 13) Requires the Director to provide assistance to university-based research centers to conduct research and development of a curriculum on disaster management methods and technologies. Provides for: (1) incorporation of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 into the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, with repeals as necessary; (2) prevention of fraud following disasters and emergencies (including special criminal penalties); and (3) a region of FEMA for the Pacific region encompassing Hawaii, American Samoa, and other U.S. areas. (Sec. 17) Requires FEMA to consult with the governing bodies of Indian tribes during disaster relief operations and with respect to other FEMA programs directly affecting them. Authorizes a tribal governing body to designate a State or local government entity to serve as its representative. Requires the Director to appoint one FEMA staff member to serve as the national liaison for all Indian tribes."
