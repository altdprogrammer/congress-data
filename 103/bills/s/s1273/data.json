Cites conditions under which: (1) an insured depository institution may subtract from its total assets a specified amount attributable to insurance proceeds when it is calculating compliance with prescribed leverage limits; and (2) a qualifying regulatory agency may deviate from certain statutory requirements with respect to regulated entities located in disaster areas. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to the Congress on the efficacy of certain disaster relief Acts, including this one, with respect to facilitating recovery from major disasters. Expresses the sense of the Congress that specified Federal banking regulatory agencies should encourage depository institutions to meet the financial services needs of their communities and customers located in areas affected by the 1993 flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries."
