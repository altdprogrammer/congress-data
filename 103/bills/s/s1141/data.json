Directs the Secretary to designate 15 to 30 Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities for hospice care demonstration projects. Allows such hospice care to be provided by Department medical facilities and personnel or by contract with a non-Department medical facility. Limits the amount paid for such care to amounts paid for hospice care programs under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. Directs the Secretary, during the pilot program period of October 1, 1993, through December 31, 1998, to designate not fewer than ten Department medical facilities at which hospice care is being provided to furnish palliative care to such veterans. Provides for: (1) informing terminally ill veterans of their eligibility for hospice and palliative care; and (2) hospice program evaluation, assessment, and congressional reports by the Secretary and the Director of the Health Services Research and Development Service of the hospice care pilot program."
