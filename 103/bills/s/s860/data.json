    "text": "Combat Era Servicepersons' Readjustment Act of 1993 - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to add a new chapter which implements the Persian Gulf War Educational Assistance Program. Makes eligible for full educational assistance under the Program each veteran of the Persian Gulf War (War) who either: (1) served on active duty for 90 days or more during the War, and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable; (2) was in a reserve or National Guard component before August 2, 1990, and served during the War on active duty on or after such date, and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable; or (3) was discharged or released from active duty any part of which was performed during the War, or following entrance into active service after enlistment or assignment in the reserve or National Guard, because of a service-connected disability. Outlines educational assistance entitlement provisions, limitations, and exceptions. Allows an active-duty veteran of the War to use any unused educational entitlement for pursuing: (1) a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training; (2) a course with an approved vocational objective; or (3) a program of secondary education, if the veteran does not have a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide such a veteran with necessary employment counseling. Directs the Secretary to make available counseling and other services deemed necessary to aid such veteran in selecting: (1) an educational objective and the educational institution appropriate for achieving such objective; or (2) an employment objective in light of the veteran's personal circumstances. Allows each eligible veteran under this Act to select a program of education at any educational institution approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs and selected by the veteran, which will accept and retain the veteran in any field which such institution finds the veteran qualified to undertake or pursue. Disapproves certain courses for educational assistance under this Act. Directs the Secretary to discontinue the educational assistance allowance of an eligible veteran if the Secretary finds at any time that the veteran's attendance, conduct, or progress is unsatisfactory. Allows the Secretary to renew such assistance under limited circumstances. Directs the Secretary to provide educational assistance to each eligible veteran under this Act in the form of a monthly educational assistance allowance. Outlines provisions concerning the computation of such monthly allowance. Requires all courses of education to be approved by the Department before such allowances are paid. Authorizes any eligible veteran to pursue a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, or a program of education exclusively by correspondence and be paid an allowance under appropriate provisions. Provides for the payment of an additional educational assistance allowance in the form of a work-study allowance to individuals performing certain work services while attending educational courses or receiving apprenticeship or other on-job training. Outlines work-study allowance requirements, limitations, and conditions. Requires an individual entitled to educational assistance under this Act and also entitled to educational assistance under another Federal program to elect a single program for such assistance. Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions with respect to the Montgomery GI Bill basic educational assistance program to provide that the amount by which an individual's basic pay is reduced on or after August 1, 1990, shall be deemed to be payable to such individual as readjustment assistance and paid to such individual by the Secretary. Provides that all members who enter onto active duty after August 2, 1990, shall be deemed to have elected to receive educational assistance. Makes identical revisions for the Selected Reserve. Increases the amount of monthly educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill program and directs (current law authorizes) the Secretary to make such payments and to increase annually the amount of such payments by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. Authorizes appropriations from the Defense Cooperation Account for payments in FY 1992 through 1995 of the costs of educational assistance programs established under this Act. Designates such costs as incremental costs associated with Operation Desert Storm and therefore exempt from sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
