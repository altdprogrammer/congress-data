Waives the provisions of this Act if the President makes a written determination that such travel: (1) cannot reasonably be postponed until after the post presidential election period; and (2) is essential to protect vital national security interests or other vital national interests related to foreign policy, foreign travel, or the economy. Prohibits funds from being expended for travel by a Member of Congress if: (1) such travel is outside of the United States; (2) such travel occurs after the date on which an election for the office held by such Member occurs; and (3) such Member will not serve as a Member of Congress in the session following such election."
