Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to States and local education agencies for drug and violence prevention programs. Requires each recipient State to establish a State Drug and Violence Prevention Coordinating Council. Allows local agencies that demonstrate implementation of the basic program to carry out an expanded program. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and contracts with higher education institutions and consortia for drug and violence prevention programs. Authorizes the Secretary to support a national center to provide training and technical assistance in developing model strategies to prevent violence and the use of illegal drugs by students at postsecondary educational institutions. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out national programs to prevent illegal use of drugs and violence among students at all educational levels. Prohibits the Secretary from prescribing the use of specific curricula for programs supported under this Act, but allows evaluation of the effectiveness of such curricula and other strategies in drug and violence prevention. Prohibits use of funds under this Act for: (1) construction, except minor remodeling; (2) drug treatment or rehabilitation; and (3) psychiatric, psychological, or other medical treatment or rehabilitation, other than school-based counseling for students or school personnel who are victims or witnesses of school-related crime."
