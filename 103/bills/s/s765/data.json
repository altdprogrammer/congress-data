    "text": "Health Insurance Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide that certain retroactive cancellations or reductions of benefits under group health plans constitute discrimination which interferes with rights protected under ERISA. Prohibits any group health plan from discriminating among diseases or medical conditions with respect to levels of lifetime benefit coverage provided to similarly situated participants and beneficiaries under the plan, with specified limitations relating to collective bargaining or special exemption procedures. Delays the adoption of any material change in a group health plan until 60 days after notification of each participant and spouse beneficiary. Sets forth special requirements for such notices from self-insured group health plans. Revises civil enforcement provisions to make any person who violates prohibitions against interference with rights of any participant or beneficiary under a group health plan liable to such participant or beneficiary for actual and consequential damages. Precludes punitive damages, except in certain circumstances. Provides for award of attorney's fees and other legal costs to plaintiffs who prevail or substantially prevail."
