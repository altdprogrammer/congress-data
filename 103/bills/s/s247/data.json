    "text": "Death Penalty Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for the imposition of the death penalty for specified Federal crimes. Requires the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant a reasonable time before trial or acceptance of a plea, of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating factors upon which it will rely. Requires a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court upon motion by the defendant, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, but permits information to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Specifies mitigating and aggravating factors. Establishes procedures for appeal from a death sentence. Provides for the appointment of counsel in Federal capital cases where the defendant is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Sets standards for the competence of counsel. Provides for the imposition of the death penalty for: (1) murder committed by prisoners in Federal prisons; (2) kidnappings which result in the death of any person; (3) hostage takings which result in the death of any person; (4) attempting to kill the President of the United States (if such attempt results in bodily injury or comes dangerously close to causing the President's death); (5) murder for hire; (6) murder in the aid of a racketeering activity; (7) international terrorism (where the killing is a first-degree murder); and (8) engaging in a criminal enterprise activity which results in death. Sets forth provisions authorizing the death penalty or lesser penalties for genocide, killings of court officers or jurors, and retaliatory killings of witnesses, victims, and informants."
