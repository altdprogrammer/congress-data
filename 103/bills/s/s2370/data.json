Authorizes the President: (1) upon approval by the United Nations Security Council of an international peace operation and after appropriate congressional consultation, to make those units available for such operations; and (2) to terminate U.S. participation in international peace operations at any time and take actions necessary to protect U.S. forces. Requires termination of any use of the armed forces with respect to which a report was submitted or required to be submitted under the War Powers Resolution within 180 days, unless the Congress has extended by law such period. Authorizes the use of funds available to the Department of Defense to carry out this Act."
