Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide such hospitals which have been reclassified as urban hospitals with an opportunity to decline such reclassification. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 to extend the rural health transition grant program. Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to demonstrate the effectiveness of outreach to populations in rural areas that do not normally seek or have adequate access to health or mental health services.
