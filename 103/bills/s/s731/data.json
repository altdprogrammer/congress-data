Requires the Secretary of Transportation, in addition to other criteria used in considering applications for rail freight assistance, to give priority to projects which enhance safety, including projects which improve, rehabilitate, or reconstruct bridges. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to authorize specified amounts of loan guarantees for any fiscal year for railroad improvements.
