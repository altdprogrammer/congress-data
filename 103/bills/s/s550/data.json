Sets forth the method for tribal cost determinations. Requires each Secretary to fully fund contract support costs associated with the operation of a tribe's annual funding agreement, with at least 80 percent made available at the beginning of the funding year. Permits lump sum payments under specified circumstances. Directs each of the Secretaries to establish in their respective Offices an Office of Self-Governance."
