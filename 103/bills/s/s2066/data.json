(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal entities to plan, operate, and replace municipal, rural, and industrial water systems, to be known respectively as the Rosebud Sioux Rural Water System and the Lower Brule Sioux Rural Water System (Systems). Includes in such Systems appropriate pumping, treatment, and electrical power facilities, pipelines, and related equipment. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to interconnect the Lyman-Jones and the West River rural water systems with the other systems under such Act and to provide water from the Missouri River through common facilities of the Oglala, Rosebud, and Lower Brule systems. (Sec. 8) Subjects such Systems to specified: (1) water and fish and wildlife conservation requirements; and (2) irrigation use prohibitions. (Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriations for the planning, design, and construction of all systems cited under this Act, to be used through the end of FY 2003. Authorizes appropriations for the: (1) Oglala, Rosebud, and Lower Brule Sioux rural water supply systems; and (2) waste water disposal system feasibility studies required under such Act. States that water delivery expenses to the West River and Lyman-Jones rural water systems are a non-Federal responsibility and shall be paid for annually by the systems. (Sec. 13) Applies certain water rights provisions under such Act to the Systems. (Sec. 14) Requires the Secretary to conduct waste water feasibility studies with regard to the Pine Ridge, Rosebud, and Lower Brule Indian Reservations."
