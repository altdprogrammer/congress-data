Establishes the Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area (conservation area). Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate the Gunnison River, Colorado, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transmit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive plan for the long-range protection and management of the conservation area. Authorizes the Secretary, to the extent appropriated funds are made available, to establish a visitors center to provide information and interpretation of both the Park and the conservation area. Establishes the Curecanti National Recreation Area (recreation area) as a unit of the National Park System. Modifies the boundary of the Gunnison National Forest. Permits the Secretary to: (1) sell or exchange certain encroachments and remove them from the recreation area; and (2) convey land known as the Riverway Tract to the city of Gunnison, Colorado. Authorizes the Secretary to operate the: (1) Wayne N. Aspinall Unit of the Colorado River Storage Project in a manner which complies with a specified water service contract for delivery of water to the Park and conservation area and which enhances flow conditions for existing water users, the Park, the conservation area, and the Wild and Scenic River designated by this Act; and (2) facilities of the Unit and the Uncompahgre project in a manner consistent with the Taylor Park Reservoir Operation and Storage Exchange Agreement dated August 28, 1975. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect in any way: (1) the allocations of water secured to the Colorado River Basin States by any compact or decree; or (2) any Federal environmental law, including the Endangered Species Act.
