Permits: (1) the use of such lands for recreational purposes consistent with the protection of the city's watershed and water supply system and with the management objectives for adjacent National Forest System lands; and (2) construction of structures or other improvements associated with such recreational activities only to the extent that the Secretary determines that such construction would be consistent with protection of the watershed and would not adversely affect the resources and values of such lands."
