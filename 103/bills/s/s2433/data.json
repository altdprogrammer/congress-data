Makes individuals who breach agreements for obligated service by failing to maintain an acceptable level of academic standing, by being dismissed for disciplinary reasons, by voluntarily terminating the program, or by failing to provide health services under the program for the applicable period, liable for the amount of the award, including amounts provided for expenses related to such attendance, and interest at the maximum legal prevailing rate. Waives or suspends such liability under specified circumstances. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) application requirements, including a plan for carrying out a project, performance standards, and linkages with relevant educational and health care entities; (2) use of funds; (3) matching requirements; (4) preferences; (5) grant and contract awards; (6) information requirements; (7) training program requirements; (8) duration of assistance; and (9) peer review. Establishes a National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice. Permits funds appropriated under the Act to be used by the Secretary to provide technical assistance. Provides for the recovery of construction assistance by the Secretary if specified conditions are not met. Specifies that the right of recovery of the United States shall not, prior to judgment, constitute a lien on any facility.

Specifies that nurse practitioner and nurse midwifery programs eligible for support are educational programs for registered nurses that meet specified guidelines and that have as their objective the education of nurses who will upon completion of their studies be qualified to effectively provide primary health care. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to, and enter into contracts with, eligible entities: (1) to meet the costs of special projects to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals who are from disadvantaged racial and ethnic backgrounds underrepresented among registered nurses by providing student scholarships or stipends, pre-entry preparation, and retention activities; and (2) for projects to strengthen capacity for basic nurse education and practice.
