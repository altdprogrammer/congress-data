States that such judge shall be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Makes the chief judge responsible for developing programs and practices which foster economy and efficiency in the processing of cases heard by ALJs, including programs to train judges, employ information technology, consolidate hearing facilities and law libraries, and foster efficient use of staff, personnel, equipment, and facilities. Establishes eight divisions within the Corps, with each division headed by a division chief judge appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Identifies the divisions and their respective areas of jurisdiction. Specifies qualifications required for division chief judges. States that the Corps' policymaking body shall be the Council of the Corps comprised of the chief judge and the division chief judges. Authorizes the Council to: (1) assign judges to divisions and to transfer or reassign judges from one division to another; (2) appoint persons as ALJs and members of the Corps; (3) file charges against an ALJ; (4) prescribe certain rules of practice and procedure for proceedings before the Corps; (5) issue rules and regulations for the efficient conduct of the Corps; and (6) perform other administrative functions. Directs the Council to appoint new judges from a register maintained by the Office of Personnel Management. Confers jurisdiction upon members of the Corps to adjudicate cases under specified sections of the Administrative Procedure Act. Requires cases arising under such sections to be referred to the Corps. Sets forth guidelines for: (1) referrals by agencies and courts; and (2) the removal and discipline of ALJs. Establishes a Complaints Resolution Board within the Corps to recommend action upon complaints against the official conduct of judges. Empowers the Council to take appropriate disciplinary action against ALJs. Directs: (1) the Corps' chief ALJ to study the various types of agency review to which decisions of ALJs are subject; and (2) the Council to report the findings of such studies to the President and the Congress. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to monitor and report to the Congress concerning financial outlays and balances resulting from functions transferred under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1995 through 1999. Provides that agencies that charged user fees to pay ALJs shall pay an amount of those fees to reimburse the Corps for services rendered."
