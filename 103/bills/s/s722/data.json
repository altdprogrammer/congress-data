    "text": "Aid for Trade Act of 1993 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to earmark foreign assistance funds for Trade and Development Agency projects in developing and middle-income countries. Limits the percentage of Economic Support Fund assistance to be used for cash transfers in FY 1994 through 1998. Declares that it is U.S. policy to give preference to the procurement of U.S. commodities and services in foreign assistance programs. Expands, and revises the authority to make, exceptions to a prohibition on the use of foreign assistance funds to procure motor vehicles that are not manufactured in the United States. (Currently, the President is authorized to waive the prohibition in special circumstances.) Bars the use of foreign assistance funds made available under cash transfers to finance commodity import transactions unless such transactions meet agency requirements for U.S. source, origin, and nationality (or unless such use is officially approved). Designates a Buy-America Advocate within the agency primarily responsible for administering development assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress on the agreement of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development to restrict tied aid practices."
