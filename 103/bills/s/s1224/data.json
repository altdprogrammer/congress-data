Permits consideration of the child's race, color, or national origin when such factors are: (1) considered in conjunction with other factors; and (2) relevant to the child's best interest. Withholds specified adoption assistance funds from such an agency or entity in cases of noncompliance. Grants any individual aggrieved by a noncomplying agency or entity the right to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District Court. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978."
