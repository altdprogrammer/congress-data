Requires the Commission to prepare and submit to the Secretary of the Interior for review and approval a plan for the management of the Area, based on existing Federal, State, and local plans in existence on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Commission to coordinate and combine such plans and present an integrated and cooperative approach for the protection, enhancement, and interpretation of the Area's cultural, natural, scenic, and recreational resources. Prohibits Federal agencies from promulgating an occupational, safety, conservation, or environmental regulation for the Area that is more stringent than existing applicable regulations, solely as a result of the establishment of the Area.
