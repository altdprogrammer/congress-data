    "text": "Expedited Exclusion and Alien Smuggling Enhanced Penalties Act of 1993 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to create grounds for exclusion of an alien who: (1) uses or attempts to use a fraudulent document to enter the United States, or to board a common carrier for such purpose; or (2) uses a document to board a common carrier and then fails to present such document to an immigration official upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. Prohibits the granting of asylum to an alien who is found to be using fraudulent entry documents or who fails to present entry-related documents, unless a specially trained immigration officer determines such actions were pursuant to departure from a country in which the alien had a credible fear of persecution or of return to persecution. Provides for port of entry exclusion and deportation without administrative or judicial appeal (except by a limited petition of habeas corpus) for such admission document fraud. Increases immigration inspection fees, with exceptions for Great Lakes and connecting waterways entry ports. Increases penalties for certain alien smuggling offenses. Creates a separate offense and penalty for an alien smuggler who seriously injures or jeopardizes the life of an alien. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to make appropriate sentencing guideline increases. Expands Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forfeiture authority to include any real or personal property used or intended to be used to smuggle aliens, or that constitutes, is derived from, or traceable to such activities. Exempts property used without the owner's consent or knowledge, or not to his or her benefit. Amends Federal law to authorize, with judicial approval, INS wiretaps for alien smuggling investigations. Brings alien smuggling operations under the purview of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provisions. Permits payment of awards for information related to terrorist acts to be used in connection with terrorist acts committed in the United States."
