Requires that any such complaint filed with an agency other than the EEOC be transmitted to the EEOC. Prohibits discharging or discriminating in any way against a Federal employee filing a complaint. Sets forth procedures for filing and processing such complaints. Permits a Federal employee to file a complaint up to 180 days following an alleged discrimination. Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to permit the filing of a complaint with the EEOC in accordance with the amendments made to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by this Act. Amends title 5 of the U.S. Code, concerning Government organization and employees, to permit an employee, under a negotiated grievance procedure, to raise matters covered under provisions of title 5 dealing with actions involving discrimination."
