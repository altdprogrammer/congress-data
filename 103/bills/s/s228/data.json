Specifies that such grants may be used to: (1) enforce a law that requires such individuals to wear approved bicycle helmets; (2) assist such individuals to acquire such helmets; and (3) develop and adminster a program to educate such individuals and their families on the importance of wearing such helmets. Sets interim standards for bicycle helmets and provides that a helmet that does not conform shall be considered in violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to begin a proceeding to review the requirements of the interim standards and establish a final standard that includes provisions to protect against the risk of helmets coming off the heads of bicycle riders and to address the risk of injury to children. Specifies that the final standard shall be considered a consumer product safety standard under the CPSA. Authorizes appropriations."
