Provides for annual notices by employers to individual employees which provide such information and a description of the procedures used by the employers to resolve allegations of sexual harassment. Requires employers to provide to each supervisory employee information specifying the responsibility of, and the methods to be used by, such employee to ensure that immediate and corrective action is taken to address allegations of sexual harassment. Prescribes civil penalties for willful violations of this Act. Directs each primary enforcement agency to make model notices and voluntary guidelines for procedures dealing with allegations of sexual harassment available to employers at no cost as well as a toll-free number for information regarding this Act. Sets forth provisions governing actions by the primary enforcement agencies to enforce sexual harassment statutes and rules."
