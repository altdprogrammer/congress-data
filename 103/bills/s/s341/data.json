Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to the Counties all rights of the United States to specified lands of the Mt. Sopris Tree Nursery (MSTN). Requires the Secretary, in the deed of conveyance to the Counties, to provide that all rights in and to lands and water rights conveyed shall revert to the United States in the event that such lands or water rights are sold or otherwise conveyed by the Counties or are used other than for public purposes. Declares that the lands exchanged between the United States and the Counties are deemed to be of approximately equal value, without any need for cash equalization, as based upon a specified statement of value prepared by Forest Service appraisers. Provides that: (1) the National Forest inholdings acquired by the United States pursuant to this Act shall become a part of the White River, Gunnison, and Arapaho National Forests, or a part of an appropriate existing wilderness area; and (2) the Quiet Title Act shall be the sole legal remedy of any party claiming any rights in or to any National Forest inholdings conveyed by the Counties to the United States pursuant to this Act. Requires the Counties to reimburse the United States for National Forest inholdings that the United States acquires under this Act that are lost in a final title determination adverse to the United States. Allocates and provides for the management of the existing water rights in the MSTN, including water well and irrigation ditch rights adjudicated under Colorado law, together with the right to administer, maintain, access, and further develop such rights. Transfers the White River National Forest Headquarters and administrative offices in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, from the jurisdiction of the U.S. General Services Administration to that of the Secretary, who shall retain such facilities."
