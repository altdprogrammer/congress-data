Amends SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) to preserve the Medicaid and SSI eligibility of individuals who would otherwise become ineligible for Medicaid benefits and SSI payments due to their receipt of weekly or biweekly income. Amends the Medicaid program: (1) to make optional currently mandatory reporting requirements under program provisions extending Medicaid coverage to eligible families making the transition from welfare to work; (2) with respect to program provisions concerning presumptive eligibility for pregnant women to include as a qualified provider any individual employed by the State and capable of making determinations of the type described under such provisions; (3) to revise the definition of qualified Medicare beneficiary and income requirements relating to pregnant women and coverage of reproductive health services; and (4) with respect to the income methodology used in determining the eligibility of certain individuals for Medicaid benefits."
