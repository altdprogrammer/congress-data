Prohibits an officer or employee of a Program agency from making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation contrary to such a notice. Provides for disciplinary action for violations. Limits the number of political appointees to the Office of Drug Control Policy. Prohibits Federal officers in the Office from using official authority or influence for partisan political purposes.

Makes certain surplus amounts within the Fund available to the Director for Federal, State, or local drug control activities. Requires each Federal program manager or department head with responsibilities under the Strategy to provide such information for drug control purposes as the Director may request. Authorizes the Director to: (1) designate certain data collection systems as being essential for drug control purposes; and (2) require that such systems be modified to ensure appropriate scope and coverage. Prohibits an officer or employee of a Program agency from taking any action to implement a change in drug control policy unless such change has been certified in advance by the Director.
