    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Contribution of Volunteer United States Military Personnel to International Peacekeeping Operations Title II: Expedited Procedures Peacekeeping Participation Act of 1993 - Title I: Contribution of Volunteer United States Military Personnel to International Peacekeeping Operations - Directs the President to report to the Congress on: (1) a plan for organizing a contingency force of armed forces personnel who volunteer to serve in international peacekeeping or peacemaking operations and for providing training to such personnel; and (2) proposed procedures to implement such plan. Authorizes the President, after appropriate congressional consultation, to make such personnel available for peacekeeping or peacemaking operations if it is in the national interest. Requires the President, within 48 hours of any deployment of the armed forces in connection with international peacekeeping or peacemaking operations, to report to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate (as required by the War Powers Resolution) on: (1) the circumstances necessitating the the introduction of the armed forces; (2) the constitutional and legislative authority under which such introduction took place; and (3) the estimated scope and duration of the involvement. Directs the President to remove such units from involvement within 90 days if the Congress has enacted a joint resolution disapproving the continued participation of such units in the operation. Provides that a certain provision of the War Powers Resolution which terminates the use of the armed forces after a certain time period unless the Congress declares war or makes a specific authorization shall not apply to peacekeeping operations. Title II: Expedited Procedures - Establishes procedures for the consideration of joint resolutions to disapprove the continued participation of the armed forces in peacekeeping or peacemaking operations."
