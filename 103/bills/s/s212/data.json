Changes from August to January the calendar year expiration date of the term of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mandates immediate public disclosure by the Committee of each change in intermediate monetary policy targets (monetary and credit aggregates, prices, interest rates, or bank reserves) which it adopts. Permits the Comptroller General to audit monetary policy deliberations, decisions, or actions, including transactions made under the Committee's direction. Requires the Board to submit annually to the President its estimated receipts and proposed expenditures for the current year, and the next two succeeding years (including those of the Federal Reserve Banks)."
