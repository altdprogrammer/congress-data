Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish criteria pursuant to which owners or operators shall identify targeted production processes on which to focus pollution prevention strategies. Directs the Administrator to establish a small business pollution prevention compliance and technical assistance program. Provides for: (1) grants to States for programs to promote pollution prevention techniques by small businesses; and (2) the establishment of Small Business Pollution Prevention Panels within EPA regional offices. Exempts from plan preparation requirements research and development laboratories and pilot facilities. Permits the Administrator to provide technical assistance in pollution prevention planning to facilities within industrial categories identified as having the highest priority for pollution prevention. Authorizes States to exercise pollution prevention planning authorities, subject to the Administrator's approval. Requires the Administrator to carry out a pollution prevention research, development, and demonstration program in coordination with other Federal agencies. Prescribes civil penalties for failures to submit pollution prevention documents. Permits the Administrator or an authorized State to deny a permit under any environmental law to any owner or operator who fails to submit pollution prevention documents. Directs the Administrator to establish a demonstration program to provide regulatory incentives for achieving pollution prevention. Authorizes the Administrator, as part of such program, to modify requirements of existing permits or agreements. Authorizes appropriations."
