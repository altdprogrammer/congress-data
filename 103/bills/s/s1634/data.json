Permits States or political subdivisions to exercise such authorities only if: (1) recyclable materials will be removed from the waste through separation at the source or at facilities unless the political subdivision in which the waste is generated is exempt from recycling requirements; and (2) the designated waste management facilities are not in violation of Federal and State environmental laws and regulations. Bars States or political subdivisions from prohibiting persons from selling, conveying, or arranging for the transportation of recyclable materials that have been separated from municipal solid waste."
