    "text": "West Virginia Rivers Conservation Act of 1994 - Amends the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978, the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to modify boundaries of the: (1) New River Gorge National River; (2) Gauley River National Recreation Area; and (3) Bluestone National Scenic River. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a segment of the Upper New River, West Virginia, as a component of the National Wild and Scenic River System (NWSRS). Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to specified congressional committees on the eligibility and suitability of designating a specified segment of the Elk River, West Virginia, as either a component of the NWSRS or a unit of the National Park System (NPS) as a national river or recreation area. Provides for consolidated management between offices and personnel administering the segment of the Upper New River designated by this Act and offices and personnel administering the New River Gorge National River, the Gauley River National Recreation Area, and the Bluestone National Scenic River. Amends the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to make provisions of the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987 (the Act) relating to cooperative agreements and remnant lands in the Gauley River National Recreation Area applicable to the New River Gorge National River. Amends the Act to set forth provisions relating to access of the Gauley River National Recreation Area by certain noncommercial recreational users. Authorizes the Secretary to construct a visitor center in the vicinity of the confluence of the New and Gauley Rivers. Extends certain provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act with respect to segments of the Bluestone and Meadow Rivers that were found eligible for addition to the wild and scenic rivers system in studies completed by NPS in 1983 but that were not designated as part of the Bluestone National Scenic River or the Gauley River National Recreation Area under the Act. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to set forth provisions relating to public access to the Bluestone River. Ceases the force and effect of any boundary modification of the Gauley River National Recreational Area relating to new project construction in the Area if construction is not commenced within the time required in the license or if such license is surrendered."
