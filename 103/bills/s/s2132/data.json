Amends the Hours of Service Act to authorize railroads, and labor organizations representing affected covered service employees of such railroads, to jointly petition the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) for approval of one or more pilot projects to demonstrate possible benefits of implementing alternatives to limitations on hours of service with respect to such employees, including those concerning maximum on-duty and minimum off-duty periods. Authorizes the Secretary to waive compliance with such requirements for up to two years if it is in the public interest and consistent with railroad safety. Sets forth a civil penalty for violation of such waiver. Requires the Secretary to report biennially (currently, annually) to the President and the Congress on the administration of Federal railroad safety rules and standards."
