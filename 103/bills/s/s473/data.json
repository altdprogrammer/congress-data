    "text": "Department of Energy Laboratory Technology Act of 1994 - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to add a new \"Title XI - Departmental Laboratories.\" (Sec. 2) Defines \"technology transfer\" to mean any collaborative effort involving governmental, educational, and private entities, including any process by which federally owned or originated technology or intellectual property rights associated with such technology are transferred to such entities. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to maintain department laboratories to advance missions to: (1) maintain national security; (2) ensure the Nation's energy supply; and (3) implement research, development, and commercial application on technologies that minimize environmental impacts of the production and use of energy. Authorizes additional missions subject to certain determinations made by the President. Prescribes a technology transfer scheme which: (1) establishes a sliding scale mechanism within which the Secretary may allocate for technology transfer activities at each departmental laboratory up to 20 percent of the funds appropriated for research, demonstration, and commercial applications; and (2) permits the Secretary to use the scientific, technical, and human resources of the departmental laboratories to improve the quality of education in science, mathematics, and engineering. Instructs the Secretary to submit to the Congress and the National Science and Technology Council a report prepared by the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board Task Force on alternative scenarios for future uses of the departmental laboratories. Directs the National Science and Technology Council to submit to the Congress its review of such report. Prescribes implementation guidelines. Directs the Secretary and the departmental laboratory directors to seek advice from industry, labor, education, and professional sectors with respect to DOE collaboration with industry. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a National Technology Partnership Award. Directs the President to review and evaluate on an ongoing basis the technology transfer implementation by the Federal laboratories. Instructs the Secretary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to contractor reform and DOE laboratory management and operations (including cost reimbursement for certain contractor fines, third party liabilities, and damage to Federal property). Requires the Secretary to use an objective merit review process before awarding financial assistance for non-military activities. Directs the Secretary to report annually to certain congressional committees on opportunities for minority educational institutions to participate in DOE activities or those of departmental laboratories. Prescribes guidelines under which cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) entered into under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 must reflect the requirements of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a departmental laboratories' cost savings implementation plan; and (2) report thereon to the Congress.
