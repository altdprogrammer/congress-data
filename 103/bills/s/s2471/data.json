Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) eligibility for grants; (2) application requirements; (3) minimum amounts allocated to qualifying States; (4) performance evaluations; and (5) technical assistance and training. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to make a compensating reduction of the authorization of appropriations from Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants."
