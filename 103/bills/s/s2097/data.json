    "text": "Environmental Export Promotion Act of 1994 - Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Environmental Technologies Trade Advisory Committee to advise and guide the Environmental Trade Promotion Working Group in the development and administration of programs to expand U.S. exports of environmental technologies, goods, and services. Requires the Working Group to assess annually which foreign countries have markets with the greatest potential for such exports, and select five of them as priority countries for the application of U.S. Government export promotion resources. Requires the Working Group to create annual plans for each priority country, detailing ways to increase U.S. environmental exports to such country. Directs the Secretary to assign a specialist in environmental technologies to the office of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in each of the five priority countries, and authorize similar assignments in any countries that are promising markets for such exports. Specifies the duties of such specialists. Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) a mechanism to give environmental technology and international environmental marketplace training to Commercial Service Officers assigned to one-stop shops and to district offices in districts with large numbers of environmental businesses; and (2) ensure that such officers receive appropriate training under such mechanism. Directs the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) to establish not less than one international regional environmental initiative to coordinate Federal activities to build environmental partnerships between the United States and the geographic region outside the United States for which such an initiative is established. Specifies TPCC activities in carrying out such initiative. Directs the Working Group to maintain an environmental technologies project advocacy calendar, updated quarterly, identifying and providing information on significant project opportunities for U.S. environmental businesses in foreign markets and trade promotion events. Authorizes the Secretary to provide matching funds for the establishment in the United States of regional environmental business and technology cooperation centers that will draw upon the expertise of the private sector, institutions of higher education, and existing Federal programs to provide export promotion assistance related to environmental technologies, goods, and services."
