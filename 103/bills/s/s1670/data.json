Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to: (1) increase from 50 to 75 percent of the cost of hazard mitigation measures the amount authorized to be contributed by the President when determined to be cost-effective while substantially reducing the damage or loss suffered in a major disaster; (2) increase the total Federal contributions authorized for damages from a major disaster to 15 percent of the estimated aggregate amounts of grants to be provided under such Act for such disaster; and (3) provide the terms and conditions under which the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency may provide property acquisition and relocation assistance in connection with flood damaged property. States that the purchase of any real property under a qualified buyout program (the federally assisted purchase of property damaged by the major Midwest flood of 1993) shall not constitute the making of Federal financial assistance available for the cost of a program resulting in the acquisition of real property or in an owner of real property being a displaced person within the meaning of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970."
