    "text": "Head Start and Early Childhood Development Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Head Start Act to reserve certain amounts, whenever the appropriation exceeds the FY 1993 appropriation, for specified activities. Authorizes Head Start agencies, subject to certain conditions, to provide: (1) infant and toddler Head Start program services to children from birth to compulsory school age; or (2) a fully integrated program of services to children from birth to compulsory school age and their parents similar to core services provided through Parent-Child Centers and child development projects under the Comprehensive Child Development Act. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to provide educational awards of up to $10,000 to individuals employed in the early child development field to assist them in repaying outstanding student loans. Directs the Secretary of Education to review the use of funds for disadvantaged students under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to determine whether such funds can be used to provide services to Head Start children in transition to elementary school. Amends the Comprehensive Child Development Act to extend the authorization of appropriations through FY 1997. Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 to direct the Commission on National and Community Service to provide supplemental post-service benefits for participants serving in early childhood development programs. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study and report to the Congress on the establishment of a pension program for Head Start employees, including feasibility of their participation in the Federal Employees Retirement System."
