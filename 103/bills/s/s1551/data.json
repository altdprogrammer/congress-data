Excludes from such provision golf courses at a facility or installation: (1) outside the United States; or (2) inside the United States at a location designated by the Secretary of Defense as a remote and isolated location. Allows no more than ten percent of the increased revenues generated by such open use to accrue to the operator of the golf course. Requires all other such revenue to be deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury and used only for Federal budget deficit reduction. Requires an annual report from the Secretary. Requires the Secretary, with respect to active and retired military personnel, to: (1) subsidize any fees imposed for golf course use; and (2) give priority access for such use."
