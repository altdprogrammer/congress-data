Prohibits such plans from requiring cost sharing for low-income individuals. Requires such plans to: (1) ensure the quality of services; (2) adhere to Federal quality standards; (3) provide for a client advocacy office; (4) provide safeguards on confidentiality and against abuse; and (5) protect individual rights. (Sec. 108) Establishes an advisory group to advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the States on all aspects of such State programs. (Sec. 110) Authorizes appropriations and provides for allotments to States. (Sec. 111) Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on evaluations of services to individuals with low-incomes and disabilities. (Sec. 112) Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to disseminate information and materials to assist specified entities in replicating successful programs aimed at offering care management to hospitalized individuals in need of long-term care so that services to meet individual needs and preferences can be arranged in home- and community-based settings as an alternative to long-term nursing home placement. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to such entities. Directs the Secretary to establish a program under which incentive grants may be awarded to assist agencies and organizations in developing and expanding programs and projects that facilitate the discharge of individuals in hospitals or other acute care facilities who are in need of long-term care services and placement of such individuals into home- and community-based settings. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) eligibility to receive grants; (2) application requirements; (3) criteria for the award of grants; (4) use of, and limitations on, grants; and (5) evaluation and reports. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Provisions Relating to Medicare - Provides for the recapture of certain health care subsidies received by high-income individuals. Transfers such amounts to the Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund. (Sec. 202) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to impose a ten percent copayment on home health services. (Sec. 203) Reduces payments for capital-related costs for inpatient hospital services. (Sec. 204) Revises the payment formulae for ambulatory surgical center procedures and radiology services and diagnostic procedures. (Sec. 205) Reduces routine cost limits for home health services."
