Increases penalties for certain alien smuggling offenses. Extends penalties to persons who contract to bring in illegal labor. Treats smuggling as an aggravated felony. Creates a separate offense and penalty for an alien smuggler who seriously injures or jeopardizes the life of an alien. Title II: Asylum - Revises asylum procedures. Sets forth mandatory and discretionary conditions for granting asylum. Establishes new application deadlines. States that asylum applications shall be determined by specially trained asylum officers. Terminates an alien's claim for failure to appear at the application hearing. Title III: Border Patrol and Asylum Officer Positions - Increases the number of Border Patrol and asylum officer positions. Authorizes appropriations."
