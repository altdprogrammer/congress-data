Missouri by minting and issuing a commemorative coin. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue one-dollar silver coins: (1) emblematic of the signing of the World War II peace accords on September 2, 1945; (2) bearing the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and (3) emblematic of the national shrines of liberty showing the Liberty Bell on one side and Independence Hall on the other. Directs the Secretary to issue five-dollar gold coins and one-dollar silver coins emblematic of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Establishes the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Maintenance Fund."
