    "text": "Arts, Humanities, and Museums Amendments of 1993 - Amends the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 (NFAHA) to prohibit the National Endowment for the Arts from increasing a State allotment if that State decreased its own funding for the arts below the average level for the previous three years and such reduction rate exceeds that for all its general fund expenditures in the current fiscal year. Extends through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations to carry out NFAHA, including funds for: (1) program grants and other assistance by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH); (2) matching non-Federal funds received; and (3) administration of NEA and NEH programs. Sets limitations on total appropriations authorized for the NEA and the NEH respectively in FY 1994. Requires an investigation and report on State compliance with specified NFAHA provisions. Amends the Museum Services Act to extend through FY 1995 the authorization of appropriations to carry out such Act, including funds for: (1) grants to museum to increase and improve services; and (2) functions of the Institute of Museum Services (which is within the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities)."
