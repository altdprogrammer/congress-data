Provides that the Public Utility Holding Company Act does not preempt State utility commission jurisdiction regarding the recovery by a public utility in its retail rates of costs it incurred pursuant to a transaction authorized by the SEC between an associate company and the utility. Prescribes guidelines for the allocation of costs by the SEC, FERC, and State utility commissions in cross-jurisdictional transactions. Declares that this Act does not: (1) affect Docket No. FA89-28; and (2) apply to costs incurred or recovered pursuant to certain contracts for the sale of fuel from Windsor Coal Company or Central Ohio Coal Company."
