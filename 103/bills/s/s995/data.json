    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1993-05-20", 
    "text": "Federal Disaster Preparedness and Response Act of 1993 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Federal Government should give immediate attention to developing a broad risk-based strategy for improving Federal readiness and response to major disasters; (2) the all hazards approach is the best way to prepare the United States for all threats; (3) all reasonable actions should be taken to mitigate the effects of disasters; (4) the American Red Cross and other volunteer organizations make valuable contributions in responding to disasters; (5) State and local responses to disasters and emergencies must be strengthened and maintained; (6) private nonprofit organizations are important in disaster relief operations and essential for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts; and (7) hazard mitigation is important in disaster preparedness and recovery. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and other specified Federal law to establish a new framework for governing Federal, State, and local government and private relief agency preparedness for and response to major disasters and emergencies through such measures as: (1) requiring respective plans by the President and Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for providing Federal assistance, when requested, to affected States and establishing chains of command, Federal agency duties, and the relationship between them and those of the State and local governments and private relief agencies involved; (2) transferring the National Disaster Medical System to FEMA; (3) requiring review of the National Guard's role in responding to such events; and (4) requiring FEMA to inventory Federal disaster resources and establish systems for the use of volunteers and management of donated goods during disasters, a State grant program for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, a university-based center for disaster research, and volunteer disaster medical and strike teams. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the President to establish a Domestic Crisis Monitoring Unit, headed by the Vice President, to: (1) monitor potential disasters and emergencies; (2) notify the President and Federal agencies of impending disasters and emergencies as soon as practicable; and (3) ensure effective, coordinated, and rapid Federal agency response immediately afterwards. Mandates restructuring of FEMA in order to implement an all hazards approach to disaster management, use defense-related resources for disasters, redefine the relationship between FEMA headquarters and regional offices, and relocate regional offices in high risk areas. Redesignates various specified political appointee positions in FEMA as career reserved positions. Creates the National Academy for Fire and All Hazards Training out of the National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control and Emergency Management Institute, which are abolished. Authorizes appropriations. Repeals the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950."
