    "as": "Reported to Senate amended", 
    "date": "1994-02-04", 
    "text": "Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1993 - Amends Federal civil service law to eliminate various restrictions on employee training. Authorizes temporary \"buy-out\" programs for encouraging selected groups of employees in the executive and judicial branches (except employees of the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency, or the General Accounting Office) to separate from Government service, generally by September 30, 1994, by offering them lump-sum payments in order to assist in the restructuring of the Federal workforce while minimizing reductions in force (RIFs). Requires: (1) such payments (the lesser of $25,000 or the amount of the employee's severance pay) to be paid from amounts available for the employee's pay, and, generally, to be fully repaid if the employee rejoins the Federal Government within five years of separation; (2) employment in the executive branch to be reduced by at least one full-time equivalent position for each one vacated by reason of a lump-sum payment; (3) that there be no increase in service contract procurement by reason of this Act except where it is financially advantageous to the Federal Government; and (4) participating Federal agencies to make a specified contribution to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund based on the final rate of basic pay of each employee who retires early. Authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to establish a program for judicial employees consistent with this Act. Sets annual limitations on the total number of full-time equivalent executive agency positions each year through FY 1999, subject to waiver under certain conditions, such as war or national emergency. Prevents further agency hiring in cases of noncompliance with such limitations. Amends Federal civil service law and the Central Intelligence Agency Voluntary Separation Pay Act regarding the forgiveness of the lump-sum repayment obligations of bought-out employees reemployed in positions for which there is exceptional difficulty in recruiting qualified employees. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to make conforming reductions in the discretionary spending limits under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 over such five year period. Revises the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with changes providing all separating TSP participants with the same options for withdrawal. Amends the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982 to allow application to employees of a State-owned railroad under such Act of the buyout provisions of this Act."
