Requires such agreement to: (1) provide for public access to the site through conducted tours; and (2) prohibit any changes or alterations in the property except by mutual agreement. Conditions cooperative agreements and financial assistance under this Act on the owner or operator submitting a comprehensive plan for the continued preservation and public use of the site for the Secretary's approval.
