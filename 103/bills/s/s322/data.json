Sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) allocations from the Fund, including funds for Indian tribes and Alaska Native Village Corporations; and (2) multipurpose acquisition by States. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance to States for outdoor recreation maintenance and security. Repeals a restriction on assistance to enclose or shelter facilities used for outdoor recreation activities. Permits the use of funds, subject to limitations, for: (1) maintenance of facilities acquired and developed with financial assistance provided pursuant to the Act; (2) costs of law enforcement and security measures; and (3) development of sheltered facilities for public health or safety in connection with projects otherwise eligible for assistance under the Act. Authorizes the transfer of funds by grant recipients to private nonprofit organizations, subject to specified requirements, to be used for projects approved in writing by the grantor of the funds in connection with the acquisition of lands (or interests in lands) and the development of recreation facilities, but not for administrative expenses. Sets forth requirements regarding maintenance of expenditures by State and Federal grant recipients."
