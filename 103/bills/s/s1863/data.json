Sets up a monitoring and testing program under each such title for ensuring such compliance, with benefits terminated or suspended in cases of noncompliance, and with all disability benefits related to substance abuse terminated after three years. Requires the proceeds derived from criminal activities to support substance abuse to be considered substantial gainful activity. Revises penalty provisions, with changes providing for the exclusion of SSDI and SSI program defrauders from such programs and other Federal health and social services programs. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) assure that every individual on drugs or alcohol who is receiving SSDI or SSI disability benefits be given high priority for treatment through entities supported by State substance abuse block grants; and (2) provide for the establishment of referral and monitoring agencies for each State for carrying out treatment requirements under this Act."
