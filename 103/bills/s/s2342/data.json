Requires the separate application of limitations on the foreign tax credit for imported property income. Expresses the sense of the Congress that deficit reduction should be achieved in part by ending loopholes and enforcement breakdowns that foster the underpayment of taxes on income from cross-border transactions and enable foreign-controlled corporations operating in the United States, and foreign persons investing in the United States, to pay no taxes."
