Establishes the Fossil Ridge Recreation Management Area, in Colorado. Withdraws such lands from all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and from disposition under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Establishes the Bowen Gulch Protection Area in the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado. Applies the same restrictions concerning land withdrawal for the Fossil Ridge Recreation Management Area to the Protection Area. Prohibits the President and any other employee of the United States from issuing a license or permit for the development or enlargement of any water resource facility within specified areas described in this Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to allow reasonable access to water resource facilities within specified areas. Sets forth various restrictions on water rights. Withdraws certain lands in the Piedra, Roubideau, and Tabeguache areas of specified national forests from all forms of location, leasing, patent, disposition, or disposal under the public land, mining, and mineral and geothermal leasing laws of the United States. Permits livestock grazing in such areas. Bars mechanized or motorized travel in such areas, with exceptions. Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to compile data concerning the water resources of such areas and water resources facilities affecting such values.
