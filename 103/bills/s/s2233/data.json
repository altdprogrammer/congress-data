(Sec. 15) Amends the: (1) Act to revise a reporting requirement and to defeat a project deauthorization if funds for planning or design (currently, only construction) have been obligated within a 30-month period; and (2) Water Resources Development Act of 1988 to repeal a five-year limitation on the period during which funds must be obligated to prevent project deauthorization. (Sec. 16) Directs the Secretary to establish a goal of awarding five percent of the total amount of civil works funds obligated for Army contracts and subcontracts for FY 1994 through 2000 to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and to historically Black colleges and minority institutions.
