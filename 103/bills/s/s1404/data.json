Provides that: (1) no such order shall continue in effect after the entry of final judgment unless at or after such entry the court makes a separate particularized finding of fact that such order would not prevent the disclosure of information which is relevant to the protection of public health or safety; (2) the party who is the proponent for entry of the order shall have the burden of proof; (3) no agreement between or among parties in a civil action filed in a court of the United States may contain a provision that prohibits or otherwise restricts a party from disclosing any information relevant to such civil action to any Federal or State agency with authority to enforce laws regulating an activity related to such information; and (4) any such information disclosed to a Federal or State agency shall be confidential to the extent provided by law."
