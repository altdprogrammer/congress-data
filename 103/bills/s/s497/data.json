    "text": "DNA Identification Act of 1993 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the use of drug control and system improvement grants to develop or improve in a forensic laboratory a capability to analyze deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for identification purposes. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Invesigation (FBI) to: (1) appoint an advisory board on DNA quality assurance methods; and (2) issue standards for quality assurance, including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories and forensic analysts in conducting such analyses. Authorizes the Director to establish an index of DNA identification records of persons convicted of crimes, analyses of DNA samples recovered from crime scenes, and analyses of DNA samples recovered from unidentified human remains. Makes the exchange of DNA identification records subject to cancellation if specified quality control and privacy requirements are not met. Requires: (1) FBI personnel who perform DNA analyses to undergo, at regular intervals, external proficiency testing; and (2) the Director to submit an annual report on the results of such tests to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for five years and to arrange for periodic blind external tests to determine the proficiency of DNA analysis performed at the FBI laboratory. Sets fines of up to $100,000 for individuals: (1) having access to individually identifiable DNA information indexed in a database created or maintained by a Federal law enforcement agency by virtue of employment or official position who willfully disclose such information to any person or agency not entitled to receive it; and (2) who, without authorization, willfully obtain DNA samples or such individually identifiable DNA information. Authorizes appropriations."
