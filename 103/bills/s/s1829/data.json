Requires indexing of certain assets (corporate stock, certain tangible property, and a principal residence) that have been held for more than one year at the time of sale or other transfer, solely for the purpose of determining gain or loss. Reduces the capital gains tax for individuals. Allows as a capital gains deduction an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the net capital gain; or (2) $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return)."
