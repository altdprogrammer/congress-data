Directs the Center to conduct research into, and provide leadership and coordination for: (1) the understanding and promotion of knowledge about the epidemiologic basis for bullet-related death and injury within the United States; (2) developing technically sound approaches for controlling and eliminating bullet-related deaths and injuries; (3) building the capacity for implementing the options and for expanding the approaches to controlling death and disease from bullet-related trauma; and (4) educating the public about the nature and extent of bullet-related violence. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the functions of the Center; and (2) establishment of an independent advisory board to assist in setting the policies for and directing the Program. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Increase in Excise Tax on Certain Bullets - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to set the excise tax rate on .25 and .32 caliber and nine millimeter ammunition at 1,000 percent, with an exemption for law enforcement agencies. Title III: Use of Ammunition - Amends the Federal criminal code to require each licensed importer and manufacturer of ammunition to maintain records of and report annually on disposition of ammunition. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare a study of the criminal use of, and regulation of, ammunition and to report to the Congress with recommendations on the potential for preventing crime by regulating or restricting the availability of ammunition. Title IV: Compliance with State and Local Firearms Laws - Amends the Federal criminal code to require compliance with State and local firearms licensing laws before issuance of a Federal license to deal in firearms."
