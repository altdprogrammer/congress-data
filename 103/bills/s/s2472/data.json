Requires the Administrator to issue proposed rules that: (1) set forth uniform general procedures governing risk assessments conducted by EPA and incorporate relevant guidelines existing prior to the issuance of such rules; and (2) govern use of a distinctive type of risk assessment approach, technique, or methodology. Directs the Administrator to issue procedures for the review and revision of a risk assessment completed prior to this Act's enactment or the issuance of final risk assessment rules. Permits petitions to the Administrator to perform reviews under certain conditions. Requires the Administrator to issue final rules for risk assessment approaches, techniques, or methodologies after taking into account comments by the public."
