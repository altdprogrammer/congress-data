Directs the Board to issue periodic reports to the Congress and various government agencies affected by activities subject to Commission jurisdiction, recommending corrective measures to: (1) reduce the likelihood of nuclear events similar to those investigated by the Board; and (2) improve safety conditions at nuclear facilities. Transfers to the Board all functions and necessary personnel of the Office for the Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data which relate to the Board's functions and authorities.
