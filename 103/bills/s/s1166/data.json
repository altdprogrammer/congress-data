    "text": "Omnibus Nuclear Power Safety and Security Enhancement Act of 1993 - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to require certain persons (including owners and operators) with information about a defect or safety violation at nuclear facilities regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), including those leased by the United States Enrichment Corporation, to notify the NRC immediately if such defect or violation could create a substantial safety hazard. Authorizes the NRC to issue regulations requiring such persons to devise and implement notification compliance procedures. Mandates that the notification requirements be preeminently posted on the business premises of persons subject to this Act. Provides a civil penalty for non-compliance. Grants the NRC enforcement powers. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to establish civil penalties for violations of its licensing or certification strictures. Declares that each day of a continuing violation constitutes a separate violation for purposes of computing the civil penalty. Repeals the requirement that the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards submit an annual status report to the Congress on reactor safety research. Authorizes the NRC to: (1) permit its licensees to carry firearms while in the discharge of their official duties; and (2) issue regulations regarding the introduction of dangerous weapons or instrumentalities upon property within its licensing purview. Includes within the penalty guidelines for the sabotage of nuclear facilities those facilities subject to NRC licensing during their construction where the damage could affect public health and safety during the operation of the facility. Sets forth guidelines for the NRC to conduct warrantless searches, and to enter certain premises with a judicially approved administrative search warrant."
