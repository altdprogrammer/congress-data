Allows such grants to be used for: (1) school-based activities, including peer education or mediation, conflict resolution training, social skills training, youth designed and developed programs, parenting education, postsecondary educational opportunity projects, or remodeling and security personnel; or (2) school-community partnership activities, including after-school programs, mentoring programs, parenting skills courses, professional training for school personnel, or job training and placement. Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to eligible entities for establishing community-based programs to: (1) assist out-of-school youth and rehabilitate youth offenders; and (2) provide opportunities for such youth to continue their education or obtain job training. Gives priority to areas with high concentrations of out-of-school youth or youth offenders and high rates of violence affecting children and youth. Allows such grants to be used for community-based programs, including peer and adult support and redirection, incentives for continuing education, assessments of needs and referrals to appropriate services, community service, job training and placement opportunities, mentoring services, and other rehabilitative opportunities.
