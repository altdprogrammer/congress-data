(Sec. 205) Amends the Department of Defense Appropriations Authorization Act, 1975 to remove the Soviet Union and the aforementioned Eastern European countries from the definition of a \"controlled country\" under provisions restricting exports of Department of Defense-funded items to controlled countries.

(Sec. 504) Repeals a provision of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 which authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act in the Soviet Union. Title VI: Provisions Related to Oceans and Environment - (Secs. 602 and 603) Replaces references to the Soviet Union in specified provisions of the Fur Seal Act of 1966 and the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987 with Russia and the independent states. Title VII: Regional and General Diplomatic Issues - (Secs. 702 and 705) Repeals specified provisions concerning U.S. policy toward Afghanistan and Angola and removes references to Communist countries under policy provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title VIII: Internal Security Provisions; Soviet Conspiracy to Establish Worldwide Communist Dictatorship - (Secs. 802 and 803) Repeals provisions of law concerning: (1) reports on Soviet press manipulation in the United States; and (2) findings on Communism and prohibitions on communications with members of Communist parties and on attempting to establish a totalitarian dictatorship.
