Authorizes a country that has been denied such designation to be so designated if the President determines that the country is fully implementing TRIPS. Directs the United States Trade Representative to notify the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development of any country which is not implementing TRIPS. Sets forth specified actions to be taken to encourage countries to implement TRIPS."
