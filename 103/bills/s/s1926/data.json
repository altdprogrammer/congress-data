Provides for staggered food stamp issuances on reservations. Requires a General Accounting Office study and report on tribal organization administration of the food stamp program. Title II: Access to Retail Food Stores by Food Stamp Households - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to: (1) redefine \"retail food store\"; and (2) define \"staple foods.\" Expands the use and disclosure of information provided by retail and wholesale food concerns to include Federal and State law enforcement and investigative agencies. Requires demonstration projects to test innovative activities directed at coupon trafficking. Continues program eligibility for establishments or house-to-house trade routes currently authorized to accept food stamps. Requires a report on the impact of this Act on retail store program participation."
