Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a demonstration project to evaluate the potential of using voluntary land exchanges within the Cache La Poudre River flood plain as a means to provide for the long-term preservation and management of the lands within the floodplain. Establishes the Cock La Poudre River Basin Heritage Advisory Commission to advise the Secretary on the preparation of the study. Authorizes appropriations."
