Directs the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Agriculture, the Interior, and the Treasury, the Chief of the Capitol Police, and the Administrator of General Services to report to the Congress concerning: (1) the policy of the respective department or agency on motor vehicle pursuits by officers of the department or agency; and (2) a description of procedures being used to train their officers in implementing such policy."
