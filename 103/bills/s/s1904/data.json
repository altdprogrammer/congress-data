Allows proceedings assigned to the Board to be assigned to an individual member or a three-member panel for decision. (Current law requires such decisions by a minimum three-member panel.) Sets forth revised provisions relating to: (1) decision reconsideration as ordered by the Chairman; (2) the correction of obvious errors upon Board motion; and (3) appeals procedures. Allows (current law requires) the Secretary to require a parents' dependency and indemnity compensation recipient or applicant to file an annual income statement. Requires the applicant to notify the Secretary (current law requires a revised report) when there is a material change in the applicant's estimated income for that year. Makes identical changes with respect to a recipient or applicant for veterans' pension benefits."
