Provides an inflation adjustment for such tax credit. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make advance payments of refunds to which eligible taxpayers are entitled by reason of the tax credit for children. Provides that such advance payments shall be made through reductions in employer wage withholdings, if the employee has in effect a child tax credit eligibility certificate. Directs the Secretary and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service to establish a taxpayer awareness program to inform the public of the availability of the credit for children. Title II: Earned Income Tax Credit Increased for Larger Families - Increases the earned income credit. Bases the credit percentage on one child, two children, or three or more children. Repeals such credit's interaction with the medical expense deduction, the deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed, and the dependent care credit. Title III: Child Support Insurance Demonstration Projects - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in order to encourage States to provide a guaranteed minimum level of child support for eligible children not receiving such support from a noncustodial parent, to make grants to between four and six States to establish or improve a system of insured minimum child support payments. Requires States to use such grants to carry out a child support insurance project to provide a minimum monthly child support benefit for each eligible child to the extent that such support is not paid by the noncustodial parent. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Community Employment Opportunity Demonstration Projects - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor to establish a program to implement community employment demonstration projects under which waivers may be granted to eligible economically depressed communities to enable them to use Federal funds to create jobs for low-income parents who are willing to work as an alternative to welfare."
