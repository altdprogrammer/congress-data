Disregards certain donated items and temporary financial assistance when determining eligibility for benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (SSA title IV part A) and Medicaid programs. Provides for a greater Federal share of grants to individuals and families residing in Midwest flood areas. Waives certain administrative costs involved in such grants. Extends the submission deadline for certain AFDC and JOBS (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program) (SSA title IV part F) program reports. Suspends temporarily certain State quality control functions. Deems States in Midwest flood areas to be in compliance with requirements under SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) relating to child support data processing and information retrieval systems. Provides for an enhanced Federal match for: (1) individuals in Midwest flood areas who are newly eligible for Medicaid or certain State welfare programs; (2) the transitional housing special needs of such individuals under AFDC; (3) emergency assistance furnished to families in Midwest flood areas with children; (4) JOBS program participants in Midwest flood areas; and (5) certain optional Medicaid services furnished to individuals in Midwest flood areas. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to provide for a permanent enhanced Federal match under the individual and family grant program for States frequently declared to be disaster areas."
