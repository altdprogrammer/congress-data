    "date": "1994-08-04", 
    "text": "School Bus Safety Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe Federal proficiency standards for school bus drivers who are required to possess a commercial driver's license to operate a school bus. Requires the Secretary, in prescribing such standards, to authorize States to establish their own proficiency standards in lieu of the Federal standards if the Secretary determines they are as rigorous as the Federal standards. Requires bus drivers to demonstrate their proficiency in operating a school bus in accordance with either the Federal or State standards. (Sec. 4) Prohibits a local agency from employing a person as a school bus driver until it conducts a criminal background check under procedures that meet the guidelines set forth in the National Child Protection Act of 1993. (Sec. 5) Amends the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems Act of 1991 to require the Secretary, in deciding which projects to fund under such Act, to ensure that one or more operational tests advance the use and reduce the cost of intelligent vehicle-highway system technologies (including hazard warning systems or sensors) that alert school bus drivers of pedestrians or vehicles in, or approaching, the path of a school bus. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations that require driver seat belts and passenger seat belts, including lap safety belts or other child safety devices meeting applicable Federal safety standards, be installed for each seating position in any newly manufactured school bus. Requires the Secretary to conduct a program to promote the use of seat belts in school buses. (Sec. 7) Requires the Secretary to ensure that each State receiving Federal aid to conduct highway safety programs utilizes a portion of such aid (at least $1 million per fiscal year) to conduct traffic engineering activities to improve the safe operation of school buses. (Sec. 8) Requires the Secretary to begin a rulemaking process to determine the feasibility of certain safety and access requirements for school buses. (Sec. 9) Requires the Secretary in carrying out highway safety research and development projects to provide for the dissemination of information on school bus safety. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 10) Requires the Secretary to conduct a study, and report the results to specified congressional committees, on school bus safety. (Sec. 11) Requires the Secretary to: (1) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to minimum reporting criteria on traffic-related deaths and injuries under State highway safety programs; and (2) issue a final rule establishing such criteria. (Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriations."
