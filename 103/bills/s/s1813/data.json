States that the eligibility to receive assistance under the levee rehabilitation assistance program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers within an area that was affected by such flooding shall not be affected by the status of participation (or lack of participation) of the public sponsor in the program. Provides application requirements of a public sponsor for such assistance, subject to specified conditions, including a 25 percent non-Federal share of program costs. Limits to $50 million the amount of the FY 1994 funding for the levee rehabilitation program that may be used to provide assistance to public sponsors who become eligible to receive assistance under such program as a result of this Act."
