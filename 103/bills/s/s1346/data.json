Sets forth provisions concerning panel membership and arbitration proceedings. Requires the Librarian to: (1) adopt a panel decision unless the decision is arbitrary; and (2) set a royalty fee or distribute fees if the decision is rejected. Provides for judicial review of Librarian decisions concerning panel determinations. Authorizes owners or users of copyrighted works to petition the Librarian for adjustments of compulsory license rates. Provides for interim royalty rates for certain musical works (that are subject to terminated license agreements) for performance by coin-operated phonorecord players. Repeals additional provisions concerning the Tribunal as well as provisions concerning compulsory licenses and limitations on exclusive rights for coin-operated phonorecord players. Revises requirements concerning compulsory licenses for public broadcasting."
