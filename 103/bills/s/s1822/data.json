(Sec. 102) Requires the FCC to establish a Universal Service Fund which shall have Federal and State mechanisms to provide sustainable support for maintaining and advancing universal service. Permits only telecommunications carriers designated as carriers of last resort to be eligible to receive payments from the Fund. Directs the FCC to establish guidelines to be implemented by States to allow for rate adjustments by existing universal service providers necessary to implement the universal service rules. Requires the FCC to ensure that the rates charged by interexchange telecommunications service providers to consumers in rural and high cost areas are maintained at levels no higher than those charged to consumers in urban areas. Bars telecommunications carriers from subsidizing competitive services from revenues obtained from non-competitive services. (Sec. 103) Requires the FCC to require owners and operators of telecommunications networks to reserve, for public uses, up to five percent of the capacity on such networks used for information services for use by eligible entities at incremental cost based rates for the delivery of such services to the public. Reserves such capacity in exchange for the use of public rights-of-way accorded telecommunications networks. Makes the following entities eligible for access to such capacity: (1) specified elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education; (2) public telecommunications entities; (3) public and nonprofit libraries; and (4) nonprofit organizations that are formed for the purpose of providing nondiscriminatory public access to noncommercial educational, informational, cultural, civic, or charitable services. (Sec. 104) Directs a telecommunications carrier designated as a carrier of last resort to provide universal service, upon request, to any public or non-profit elementary and secondary school, library, health care facility, museum, public broadcast station, and other public institutional telecommunications users that contribute to the public's quality of life. Provides for preferential rates for telecommunications and information services to public institutional telecommunications users. Prohibits users receiving universal services or services at a preferential rate from reselling such service or from aggregating such services. Title II: Telecommunications Investment - Requires consumers in rural and noncompetitive markets to have access to high quality interoperable telecommunications network facilities and capabilities that are available at reasonable, nondiscriminatory rates. Provides FCC preemptive authority over conflicting State or local statutes or regulations in such regard. Encourages telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers to develop standards which ensure the interconnection, interoperability, and reliability of such networks. (Sec. 201) Allows the FCC to develop such standards only if industry participants fail to reach agreement. Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations that: (1) permit joint network planning, design, and implementation among all telecommunications carriers, cable television companies, railroads, and electric, gas, water, and other utilities in the same geographic area; and (2) require specified local exchange carriers to share public switched network infrastructure, facilities, and functions with requesting carriers which lack the economies of scale or scope and provide universal service to all consumers without preference throughout the area for which such carriers have been designated carriers of last resort. Requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that advances in network services are accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities unless the cost of accessibility would result in an undue burden or adverse competitive impact. Directs the FCC to complete an inquiry into policies and regulations that address the access needs of individuals with speech disabilities for purposes of developing more effective ways to incorporate current specialized consumer product equipment devices into the nation's telecommunications infrastructure and to address the speech-to-speech translation needs of individuals with significant voice disabilities. Requires the FCC to adopt regulations to allocate a local exchange carrier's cost of deploying broadband telecommunications facilities between local exchange service and competitive service. Directs the FCC to ensure that access to telecommunications services is not denied to any group of potential subscribers because of race, gender, national origin, income, age, or residence in a rural or high-cost area. Title III: Regulatory Reform - Bars any State or local statute, regulation, or legal requirement from prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide interstate or intrastate telecommunications services. Prohibits local governments from imposing or collecting any fee as a condition for operating in the locality or for obtaining access to or crossing public rights-of-way from any telecommunications carrier that distinguishes between or among such carriers. Preempts any inconsistent State or local requirement. (Sec. 302) Requires the telecommunications carriers to provide certain access and services to providers of telecommunications equipment or entities seeking to provide services at reasonable, nondiscriminatory rates. Directs the FCC to ensure that consumers: (1) are given information to make informed choices among telecommunications alternatives; and (2) have the opportunity to select their local exchange carrier by means of a balloting and presubscription process. Requires the FCC to ensure that telecommunications carriers compensate each other for termination of telecommunications services on each other's networks. Provides the FCC flexibility in applying certain regulations in any geographic market if: (1) enforcement is not necessary to ensure that charges, practices, or regulations are reasonable and nondiscriminatory; (2) enforcement is not necessary for consumer protection; and (3) forbearance from applying a regulation is consistent with the public interest. Grants telecommunication carriers pricing flexibility in competitive markets, provided that rates for universal service and other services that are noncompetitive remain reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Prohibits owners or managers of multi-unit buildings from forbidding or restricting building occupants or lessees from receiving telecommunications services from a provider of their choice who is authorized by a State regulatory agency. Requires entities seeking to provide telephone exchange service in an area served by a rural telephone company to first obtain approval from the appropriate State commission to ensure compliance with relevant State statutes or regulations. Directs the FCC to promulgate regulations to permit State oversight of rural markets. Authorizes the FCC to preempt inconsistent or discriminatory State regulations. Prohibits a rural telephone company, unless authorized to provide video programming directly to subscribers under the Act, from providing such programming or obtaining a controlling interest in a cable operator providing service in the telephone company's service area unless: (1) the State has not imposed any conditions on an entity's ability to provide telephone exchange service in such service area; (2) the company successfully petitions the State to waive any conditions on its ability to provide such service; or (3) an entity unaffiliated with the company obtains approval from the State to provide such service in the service area. Waives or modifies certain obligations of telecommunications carriers (including unbundling requirements) and presubscription and balloting rights of consumers for rural telephone companies and carriers that have fewer than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines installed if such requirements would result in unfair competition or otherwise not be in the public interest. Amends the Public Utility Holding Company Act to exempt communications entities from all provisions of such Act. Permits registered holding companies to acquire and hold the securities or business interests of such entities without Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval. Provides that the issuance of securities by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the acquisition of a communications entity, the guarantee of securities of such an entity by a holding company, and the creation or maintenance of other relationships between such an entity and company shall remain subject to SEC jurisdiction. Authorizes such companies to petition the FCC to market telecommunications services directly provided by associate companies which are communications entities upon a showing that a cable operator or other entity provides such services and markets such services jointly with video programming services in the geographic region covered by the petition. Prohibits public utility companies that are associate companies of registered holding companies and that are subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission with respect to retail electric or gas rates from including in such rates, without the approval of the State commission, any cost associated with the: (1) issuance of securities for purposes of financing the acquisition, ownership, or operation of communications entities; (2) the assumption of any obligation or liability as guarantor or otherwise in respect of any security of an entity; or (3) pledge or encumbering of utility assets for the benefit of such entities. Amends the Federal Power Act to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the power to disallow prospectively, for purposes of determining a just and reasonable rate for consumers, certain costs associated with transactions of a public utility holding company and an affiliated company pursuant to contracts regulated by the SEC.
