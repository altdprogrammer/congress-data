Directs the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to determine whether: (1) each coastal State has adopted measures necessary to implement the Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Weakfish (dated 1985) in its coastal waters; and (2) the enforcement by the Plan by each State is satisfactory. Requires the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to declare a moratorium on fishing for weakfish in States that are not in compliance with the Plan."
