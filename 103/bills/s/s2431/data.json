    "date": "1994-09-13", 
    "text": "Crime Control Improvement Act of 1994 - Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the Act) to eliminate the Model Intensive Grant Program, the Local Partnership Grant Program, the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program, the Family and Community Endeavor Schools Program, the Community-Based Justice Grant Program, the Urban Recreation Program, the At-Risk Youth Program, the Police Recruitment Program, the National Community Economic Partnership Program, the Community Schools Program, the Ounce of Prevention Program, the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program, the Drug Courts Program, and the Family Unity Demonstration Project. Revises the Act to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to construct, expand, modify, operate, or improve conventional prisons (currently, correctional facilities). Repeals provisions regarding the transfer of unused funds. Increases Federal mandatory minimum sentences for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, employing minors in drug trafficking, and selling illegal drugs to minors. Bars the court from placing on probation or suspending the sentence of any person convicted of such offenses. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the definition of \"aggravated felony.\" Authorizes the Attorney General to issue a final order of deportation against any alien who was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or who had permanent resident status on a conditional basis, whom the Attorney General determines to be deportable under provisions relating to conviction of an aggravated felony. Limits judicial review of such determinations. Provides for deportation of permanent resident aliens under specified circumstances. Grants a U.S. district court jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of deportation at the time of sentencing against an alien whose criminal conviction causes such alien to be deportable if requested prior to sentencing by the U.S. Attorney. Restricts defenses to deportation. Enhances penalties for failing to depart or reentering after a final order of deportation. Limits collateral attacks on deportation orders. Directs the Attorney General to operate a criminal alien tracking center. Authorizes appropriations. Revises provisions of the Act pertaining to the non-application of mandatory minimum sentences in certain cases involving nonviolent drug offenses. Expresses the sense of the Congress that all grants authorized under the Act and not required to be distributed according to a formula prescribed by law shall be distributed in a fair and equitable manner that ensures that rural States receive a fair and proportional share of the funds."
