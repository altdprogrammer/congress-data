    "text": "Counterintelligence and Security Enhancements Act of 1994 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to prohibit a person from becoming an employee of an agency within the U.S. intelligence community unless the person: (1) authorizes the disclosure of tax returns; (2) agrees to allow an investigative agency to inspect financial accounts valued at over $10,000; and (3) agrees to the inspection of such person's foreign travel records. Sets forth additional requirements for critical intelligence positions, including requirements for information with respect to the nature, location, and material changes to accounts valued at over $10,000 and information with respect to foreign travel unrelated to official duties. Requires authorized investigative agencies to periodically review all information so obtained and notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) upon an indication of the loss or compromise of critical intelligence information. Provides for: (1) requests by authorized investigative agencies for appropriate information from governmental entities; (2) protection of the confidentiality of such information; and (3) investigative agency liability for unlawful disclosure of such information. Empowers the FBI Director with overall responsibility for conducting counterintelligence and law enforcement investigations involving persons in critical intelligence positions. Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to report to the congressional intelligence committees on the effectiveness of such investigative activities. Requires implementation of such provisions with respect to current employees in the intelligence community as well as congressional staff having access to critical intelligence information. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to provide for the disclosure to the FBI of consumer credit reports (CRs) for counterintelligence purposes if the FBI Director certifies that such records are necessary for an investigation and there is reason to believe that the person for whom the CR is sought is a foreign power or agent. Sets forth provisions governing, with respect to such disclosures by a credit reporting agency: (1) the disclosure of identifying information to the FBI; (2) confidentiality requirements concerning such disclosure; (3) the payment of fees by the FBI for such disclosures; (4) limits on the dissemination of information contained in the CRs; (5) disciplinary actions for disclosure violations (with an exception for a good faith disclosure); and (6) remedies (including injunctive relief). Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide FBI access to tax returns for counterintelligence purposes. Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General to award individuals who provide information which leads to an arrest or conviction with respect to an act of espionage. Provides U.S. court jurisdiction to try cases involving acts of espionage by a U.S. citizen outside the United States. Makes the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material a misdemeanor criminal offense. Allows for the forfeiture of property for violation of certain espionage laws."
