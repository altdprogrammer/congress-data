Authorizes the delegation of authority for a certification program to a State, subject to certain conditions. Makes certifications valid for a five-year period.

Requires institutions of higher education, in addition to other requirements for receiving scholarships for individuals planning to enter occupations involving treatment works, to: (1) have participated in the treatment works training program; and (2) ensure representation of minorities and women in the scholarship program.
