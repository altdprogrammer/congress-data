Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a grant program to support scientists who have distinguished themselves in the field of Parkinson's research; (2) a registry for screening and collecting patient and family data that may be useful in determining incidence and possible risk factors concerning Parkinson's; and (3) a national education program designed to foster a national focus on Parkinson's and the care of those with Parkinson's.
