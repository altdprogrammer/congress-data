    "text": "Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Assistance Act of 1993 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to qualify grandchildren for social security benefits based only on their dependency on social security recipients. Sets special rules if one of a grandchild's natural or adoptive parents is living. Provides for suspension of such benefits in the event the grandchild reunites with a natural or adoptive parent. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of SSA title IV to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a model procedure for States to use in notifying relatives before the placement of a child in foster care. Directs the Secretary, if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has not done so by a specified deadline, to develop model standards for the coverage of dependents under health insurance policies. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to expand the data collection efforts of the Bureau of the Census to enable it to collect statistically significant data on the growing trend of grandparents who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren. Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to direct the Commissioner on Aging to make grants to or enter contracts with one eligible entity to establish and operate the National Resource Center for Grandparents to serve as a central source of information and assistance to older individuals who: (1) raise their grandchildren; (2) encounter problems obtaining visitation access to their grandchildren; or (3) need financial, legal, emotional, or informational assistance regarding their relationship with their grandchildren."
