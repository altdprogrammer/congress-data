Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish regulations establishing a program of voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing providing for less substantial sanctions than those otherwise imposed for health care fraud and abuse. Authorizes appropriations for hiring additional personnel for HHS's Office of Inspector General to sustain and expand the investigation of health care fraud."
