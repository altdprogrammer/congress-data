Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) mitigating and aggravating factors; and (2) a special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death is justified. Prohibits: (1) imposition of the death penalty on persons less than age 18 at the time of the offense; and (2) requiring any employee of a State department of corrections or the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or the U.S. Marshals Service, and any employee providing services to that department, bureau, or service under contract, to be in attendance at or participate in any execution if such participation is contrary to the employee's moral or religious convictions. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) instructions to the jury to ensure against discrimination based on race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim; (2) imposition of a sentence of death; (3) review of a death sentence; (4) use of State facilities; (5) appointment of counsel for indigent defendants; (6) collateral attack on a judgment imposing the death sentence; and (7) stays of execution."
