    "text": "Technology for the Classroom Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to eligible consortia to develop instructional programs and technology-based systems for complete courses or units of study for a specific subject and grade level, if these are commercially unavailable locally. Requires that an eligible consortium consist of: (1) State or local educational agencies in partnership with businesses; and (2) institutions of higher education or other public or private nonprofit organizations. Requires priority to be given to applications describing programs that are developed: (1) so that the program may be adapted and applied nationally; and (2) to raise the achievement levels of students, particularly disadvantaged students who are not realizing their potential. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to: (1) identify schools or school districts which have a large number of educationally disadvantaged students and limited access to technology-based learning resources; and (2) develop jointly, with local educational agencies or individual schools, strategies to improve accessibility and use of technology-based learning resources, including specific plans for teacher and school personnel training, hardware or software acquisition (if this is a major barrier to accessibility), and partnership arrangements with businesses, institutions of higher education, and other public or private nonprofit organizations. Sets forth State plan requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate and share information regarding these curriculum-based educational technology programs with other Federal agencies; and (2) collect and disseminate information about such developed products and their evaluation. Requires that any royalties paid to any State or local educational agency as a result of assistance provided under this Act be used for further development of curriculum-based learning resources authorized by this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
