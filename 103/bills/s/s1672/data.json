Affirms that certain existing statutory provisions that impose limitations on the Soviet Union or utilize language that reflect the tension that existed between the Soviet Union and the United States should not be construed as being directed against the independent states, connoting an adversarial relationship between the United States and these states, or implying unfriendliness toward such states. Title II: Trade and Business Relations - Sets forth U.S. policy concerning the shooting down of Korean Airlines Flight 7. (Sec. 202) Amends the Federal criminal code to consider persons engaged in legal commercial transactions as agents of Cuba or any other country determined by the President to pose a threat to national security interests to be foreign agents subject to notification requirements. (Current law considers agents of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania as foreign agents for such purposes.) (Sec. 203) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to prohibit military technology developed with funds for the Ballistic Missile Defense Program from being transferred to any independent state unless the President certifies to the Congress that such transfer is in the national interest and is for purposes of maintaining peace. (Sec. 204) Amends the Department of Defense Appropriations Authorization Act, 1975 to repeal provisions that restrict exports of Department of Defense-funded items to controlled countries. Title III: Cultural, Educational, and Other Exchange Programs - Changes references in specified laws concerning exchanges from the Soviet Union to the independent states. Title IV: Arms Control - Changes certain references to the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in the Arms Control and Disarmament Act and the Arms Export Control Act to the independent states, Russia, and Eastern Europe. Title V: Diplomatic Relations - Repeals specified provisions concerning: (1) personnel restrictions on Soviet national employees of foreign missions or international organizations; and (2) Soviet embassies and consulates (particularly with regard to security measures) and U.S. embassies in the former Soviet Union. (Sec. 503) Repeals a provision of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 which authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act in the Soviet Union. Title VI: Oceans and Environment - Replaces references to the Soviet Union in specified provisions of the Fur Seal Act of 1966 and the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987 with Russia and the independent states. Title VII: Regional and General Diplomatic Issues - Repeals specified provisions concerning U.S. policy toward Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and Angola and removes references to Communist countries under policy provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title VIII: Internal Security; Worldwide Communist Conspiracy - Repeals provisions of law concerning: (1) reports on Soviet press manipulation in the United States; and (2) findings on Communism and prohibitions on communications with members of Communist parties and on attempting to establish a totalitarian dictatorship. Title IX: Miscellaneous - Repeals provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 concerning: (1) Soviet missile tests near Hawaii; (2) emigration from the Soviet Union; and (3) delivery of international mail within the Soviet Union. Removes references to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in provisions concerning persecution of Christians. (Sec. 903) Repeals provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 concerning: (1) the murder of a specified U.S. army officer; and (2) Soviet policy toward pentecostal Christians. (Sec. 905) Authorizes the National Captive Nations Committee, Inc., to construct an international memorial in the District of Columbia to honor victims of communism."
