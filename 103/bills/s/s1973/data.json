Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) such Federal program's termination date; (2) the allocation of funds (with priority to programs in areas experiencing high rates of crime in which handguns are used, but with urban and rural areas each receiving an appropriate amount of assistance); and (3) reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
