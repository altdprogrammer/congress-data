Title II: Multiple-Use Resource Recovery Land Designations - Designates all Federal lands in Montana as multiple-use resource recovery lands to be managed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Excludes from such designation: (1) wilderness areas; (2) lands that are components of the national wild and scenic rivers or the national trails systems; (3) land withdrawn from mineral entry or timber production by Federal law or executive order; and (4) lands not reviewed for suitability as wilderness during the Second Roadless Area Review and Evaluation Program conducted by the Department of Agriculture. Requires the Secretary to: (1) emphasize the uses that are not allowed on lands designated as wilderness areas or other withdrawn lands; and (2) certify to specified congressional committees that the land and resource management plans for such lands do not preclude the achievement of output targets. Title III: Special Management Areas - Designates certain Federal lands in Montana as special management areas. Describes activities authorized on such lands, including the removal of minerals, the use of motorized equipment, if compatible with designated land uses, and livestock grazing. Title IV: Water Rights - Authorizes the Secretary to acquire such water rights as appropriate to carry out the administrative responsibilities on lands designated under this Act. Provides that this Act may not be construed to affect specified existing water rights of the State of Montana and the utilization of certain water diversion structures. Title V: Protection of Private Property - Directs the Secretary to: (1) comply with applicable State laws, including those relating to private property rights and privacy; and (2) administer this Act in a manner consistent with the constitutional and other legal rights of private property owners. Title VI: Badger-Two Medicine Area - Directs the Secretary to administer certain lands known as the Badger-Two Medicine Area in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, Montana, for nonwilderness, multiple-use purposes. Excludes from such designation lands in such area designated by the Blackfeet Tribal Council as having specific cultural or religious significance."
