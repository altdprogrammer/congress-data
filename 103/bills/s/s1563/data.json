    "text": "American Jobs Protection Act - Requires employers to provide specified notice and employee benefits (including severance pay, continuation of health care benefits, reimbursement for retraining, training incentive payments, and accelerated eligibility for early retirement) to employees who are subject to a plant closing or mass layoff because their work is transferred to (or similar products are imported from) another country which has specified levels of lower wages or less effective employment standards for overtime compensation, child labor, and employee safety. Prohibits employers who do not provide such notice and benefits, except in cases of national security, from entering into a contract with the United States for provision of products or services involved in the work transfer or substantially similar products or services. Provides for enforcement of this Act by: (1) investigative and administrative actions and actions for injunctions by the Secretary of Labor; and (2) civil actions by employees, local governments, States, and the Secretary. Requires employers to post notice concerning this Act and the filing of a charge. Authorizes civil fines for violations."
