Defines: (1) \"core library products and services\" as domestic interlibrary loan and information products and services customarily provided by libraries to users at no charge; and (2 ) \"specialized library products and services\" as specified customized information products and services that exceed core services, that are not national library products and services, and that are designed for individuals or discrete groups of persons or entities. Title I: Library Products and Services - Authorizes the Librarian of Congress to furnish national library products and services to institutions or individuals for a price that covers distribution costs. Requires the Librarian to report to the Joint Committee on the Library before establishing translation and foreign language services. Title II: Library of Congress Revolving Fund for Specialized Products and Services - Establishes the Library of Congress Revolving Fund to be available for specialized library information products and services. Authorizes the Librarian to furnish such products and services to institutions and individuals for purchase at a price covering production and distribution costs. Requires the Librarian to set fees to recover the costs of such products and services. Title III: General Standards and Limitations - Requires the Librarian to respect and preserve the security classification of any scientific or technical material in the possession or control of the Library. Requires the President to certify the classified status of items received as being essential in the interest of national defense. Declares that this Act shall not modify Federal copyright law. Prohibits: (1) the use of Congressional Research Service (CRS) resources to generate fee-based research and information services; or (2) the marketing or publication of CRS products without prior approval of either the Committee on House Administration or the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Requires the Library to follow rulemaking notification procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act when proposing new Fund service activities."
