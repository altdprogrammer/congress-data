Establishes application procedures. Requires the issuance of an honorable discharge, subject to the same standards relating to the nature and duration of service that apply to the honorable discharges issued under the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977, to an individual who performed qualified service. Deems qualified service of an individual who receives an honorable discharge under this Act and who is not eligible under any other provision of law for benefits administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be active duty in the armed forces during a period of war for purposes of eligibility for benefits. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) reimbursement of the Secretary for the value of benefits that the Department of Veterans Affairs provides to an individual by reason of eligibility under this Act; and (2) processing fees to correct records."
