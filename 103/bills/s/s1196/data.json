    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Criminal Penalties Title II: Procedures Alien Smuggling Control Act of 1993 - Title I: Criminal Penalties - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to increase the imprisonment penalty for specified acts involving alien smuggling (including knowingly hiring smuggled aliens). Amends Federal criminal law to include alien smuggling within the parameters of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (RICO). Amends INA to subject all property, real and personal, associated with illegal aliens smuggling or harboring activities (not only conveyances, as under current law) to Federal seizure and forfeiture. Expands the definition of \"aggravated felony.\" Authorizes the Attorney General to issue a final deportation order against certain non-permanent resident aliens. Provides for limited judicial review of such orders. Establishes a conclusive presumption of deportability for aliens convicted of an aggravated felony. Confers jurisdiction upon a Federal district court to enter a deportation order against such aliens at the time of sentencing upon request of the United States Attorney. Restricts the defenses to deportation for aliens sentenced or convicted of aggravated felony. Amends the penalty guidelines for failing to depart, or reentering, after a final deportation order. Title II: Procedures - Amends Federal criminal law to set forth death penalty procedures for defendants convicted of causing the death of an illegal alien during the course of alien smuggling activities."
