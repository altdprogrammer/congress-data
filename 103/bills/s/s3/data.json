Permits a candidate to spend: (1) an additional $200,000 in a runoff election; (2) $600,000 in a special election; and (3) an additional $200,000 in a closely contested primary. Waives such limits for a candidate whose opponent is not participating in such spending limitations and receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of 25 percent of election cycle limits. Exempts from such limits legal, tax, accounting, and fund raising costs. Sets forth graduated civil penalties for different levels of excess expenditures. Limits a candidate's personal campaign contributions in an election cycle to $50,000. Waives such limits in the case of a nonparticipating opponent who exceeds such limits. States that the Federal Election Commission (Commission) shall determine a candidate's eligibility to participate in the voluntary program of spending and contribution limits established by this Act. Entitles an eligible candidate to up to $200,000 in voter communication vouchers. Sets forth eligibility requirements, including: (1) having raised at least ten percent of contributions from individual contributions; and (2) general election ballot qualification of both the candidate and his or her opponent. Permits voucher use to purchase: (1) broadcast time; (2) print advertisements; (3) voter contact campaign materials; and (4) postage.

Title III: Independent Expenditures - Amends FECA to define \"independent expenditure\" as an expenditure for an advertisement or other communication that: (1) contains express advocacy; and (2) is made without the participation or cooperation of a candidate or a candidate's representative. Excludes from the meaning of \"independent expenditure\" any expenditure by: (1) a political committee of a political party; (2) persons who communicate or receive information about activities that have a purpose of influencing a candidate's election; and (3) persons with other specified relationships with a candidate or candidate's agents in the same election cycle. Defines \"express advocacy\" as any communication that when taken as a whole: (1) expresses support for or opposition to a specific candidate, a specific group of candidates, or candidates of a particular political party; or (2) suggests taking action with respect to an election, such as voting for or against, contributing to, or participating in campaign activity. (Sec. 302) Sets forth reporting requirements for certain independent expenditures. (Sec. 303) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast or cable station to notify a candidate and offer equal broadcast opportunity if an independent communications expenditure has been made against such candidate. Title IV: Contributions and Expenditures By Political Party Committees - Amends FECA to define: (1) \"generic campaign activity\" as a campaign activity on behalf of a party rather than a candidate; and (2) \"State Party Grass Roots Fund\" as a segregated State fund on behalf of a federal candidate. (Sec. 402) Permits maximum contributions to a State Party Grassroots Fund of: (1) $20,000 by an individual; and (2) $15,000 from a multicandidate committee. Establishes an overall $60,000 annual limit on individual contributions, including specified limits for: (1) candidates and their political committees; and (2) State committees. (Sec. 403) Subjects to certain limitations, prohibitions and reporting requirements any amount (\"soft money\") solicited, received, or expended directly or indirectly by a national, State, district, or local committee of a political party (including any subordinate committee) with respect to an activity (such as voter registration and get-out-the vote activities, among others) which, in whole or in part, is in connection with an election to Federal office. Prohibits a national political party committee and a congressional campaign committee from soliciting or accepting contributions not subject to FECA limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements. (Sec. 404) Requires: (1) a national committee and a congressional campaign committee to report all receipts and disbursements whether or not in connection with a Federal election; and (2) any other political committee to report all receipts and disbursements in connection with a Federal election.

(Sec. 508) Prohibits specified election-related activities by foreign nations. Title VI: Reporting Requirements - Amends FECA to require all Federal candidates and authorized committees to aggregate information on their financial activity reports on an election cycle basis (instead of a calendar year basis, as at present). (Sec. 602) Requires candidates to report any expenditure in excess of the reporting threshold made to a person who provides services or materials for the candidate, whether the payment was made directly or indirectly under subcontract to another person providing personal or consulting services. (Sec. 603) Reduces from $200 to $100 the threshold for reporting certain information by persons other than political committees. (Sec. 604) Requires the Commission to maintain computerized indices of all contributions of at least $200. (Sec. 607) Prohibits an unauthorized political committee from using a candidate's name so as to suggest the candidate has authorized such committee. (Sec 609) Provides for the simultaneous registration of a candidate's statement of candidacy and principal campaign committee organization.

(Sec. 802) Excludes ballot initiative contributions and expenditures from the usual meaning of contributions and expenditures under FECA. (Sec. 804) Makes the political committee organizational and reporting requirements (and attendant civil penalties) under FECA applicable to ballot initiative committees. Title IX: Miscellaneous - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast station to make broadcast time available to candidates in the last 30 (currently 45) days before a primary and the last 45 (currently 60) days before a general election, at the lowest unit charge of the station for the same amount of time (currently, the same class and amount of time) for the same period on the same date. Prohibits broadcasters from preempting advertisements sold to political candidates at the lowest unit rate, unless the preemption is beyond the broadcaster's control. (Sec. 903) Directs the Commission to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of developing telephonic voting for persons with disabilities. Title X: House of Representatives Campaign Election Funding and Related Matters - Amends FECA to establish in the Treasury the Make Democracy Work Election Fund.
