Requires such labeling to disclose the impact speed at which the manufacturer represents that the vehicle meets the applicable damage criteria under the bumper standard specified in the Code of Federal Regulations. Directs the Secretary to amend such bumper standard to make it identical with the standard in effect on January 1, 1982, but applicable only to such vehicles manufactured after September 1, 1995. Permits the Secretary to require a standard more stringent than the one in effect on January 1, 1982."
