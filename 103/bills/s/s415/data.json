Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) capacity of such camps; (2) eligibility requirements for Federal and State prisoners; (3) post-release supervision (including aftercare, with provision for educational and vocational training and drug or other counseling and treatment where appropriate); and (4) termination of the program. Directs the Attorney General to evaluate the boot camp prisons and report to the Congress on their performance, including an assessment of the rate of recidivism of boot camp prisoners as compared with similar defendants in conventional prisons, the cost effectiveness of boot camp prisons as compared to conventional prisons, and the program's effect on the overcrowding of conventional prisons. Authorizes appropriations."
