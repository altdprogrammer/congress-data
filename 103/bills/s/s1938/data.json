    "text": "Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Amendments of 1994 - Amends Federal law with respect to Home Energy Assistance to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to assist low-income households, particularly those that pay a high proportion of household income, both for meeting immediate energy needs and in attaining the capacity to meet such needs independently in the future. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations for home energy assistance needs arising from a natural disaster or other emergency. Modifies the authorized uses of funds including: (1) outreach activities and assistance particularly to low income households that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy; (2) intervention in energy crisis situations; (3) low-cost residential weatherization; and (4) State program planning and development, including leveraging programs. Authorizes the States to give priority to households with the highest home energy burdens. Requires State applications for assistance to include a plan which targets assistance to households with high home energy burdens. Repeals the prohibition against the Secretary's prescription of the manner in which the States will comply with the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. Requires State applications for assistance to include: (1) a plan which describes which Department of Energy rules for Low Income Weatherization Assistance Program the State will follow with respect to repairs and improvements; and (2) specified data on the households assisted under this Act. Requires each State to notify the Secretary of any amounts that remain unobligated prior to the close of the fiscal year."
