Requires the Secretary to issue final regulations by a specified deadline. Prohibits any air carrier from operating an aircraft using a flight attendant who has been on duty in excess of specified hours or who has had less than a specified number of hours of rest if such regulations have not been promulgated by a certain time. Permits modification of the specified hours of duty if the Secretary determines such modification is in the public interest and submits a copy of the modifying regulations to certain congressional committees. Treats a duty period with both domestic and international flight segments as international flying for purposes of calculating duty and rest requirements if the majority of the flight time during such period is on an international or domestic segment."
