Extends through December 31, 1996, the authority of the Department to enter into enhanced-use leases (leasing unused Department property to others). Increases from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 the Department cost threshold for consideration: (1) of a project as a major medical facility project; and (2) of a parking facility construction, alteration, or acquisition project as a major medical facility project. Amends the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 to increase from 35 to 99 years the authorized period for leasing newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated areas of Pershing Hall in Paris, France."
