    "text": "Makes technical corrections to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to exclude certain U.S. citizens hired at posts abroad who are not family members of U.S. Government employees from coverage under Foreign Service grievance provisions. Prohibits the sale or lease of defense articles or services by the U.S. Government to any country or international organization that is known to have sent letters to U.S. firms requesting compliance with, or soliciting information regarding compliance with, the secondary or tertiary (currently, primary or secondary) Arab League boycott unless the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the country or organization does not currently maintain such a policy or practice. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the pilot visa waiver program through FY 1995. Authorizes the Secretary of State to transfer a specified amount from the Department of State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs appropriation to appropriations available to the General Services Administration for the purchase of real property for use by the Department of State for its Miami Regional Center. Revives provisions of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 regarding Voice of America."
