    "text": "Amends Federal law regarding stock-raising homesteads to require a written notice to the surface owner and the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) before a person may enter lands for exploration purposes or to locate a mining claim. Provides for an authorized exploration period during which exploring and locating a mining claim may be conducted with specified negligible surface disruption. Limits the total acreage that may be covered at any time by notices of intention to locate a claim. Prohibits any mineral exploration or development activities without the surface owner's written consent (unless the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) has authorized them according to prescribed guidelines). Prohibits the Secretary from authorizing any mineral activities unless a plan of operations has been submitted meeting specified criteria. Directs the Secretary to submit such plan of operations for the surface owner's comments and modifications before determining whether it complies with this Act. Requires the person submitting a plan to pay a fee to the surface owner for the use of surface during mineral activities. Requires reclamation of land to return it to a condition capable of supporting the uses which it was capable of supporting before surface disturbance. Authorizes any surface owner to request an inspection if such owner has reason to believe that he may be adversely affected due to any violation of an approved plan of operations. Provides for enforcement through a civil action by the surface owner. Requires the Secretary to simplify the procedure for surface owners who apply to obtain title to interests in Federal lands."
