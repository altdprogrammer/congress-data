    "text": "Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to participate in, and receive products from, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center of the Department of the Treasury. Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to allow the FTC to bring criminal contempt actions for violations of court orders in the same manner as civil penalties and other Federal court actions. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines relating to: (1) fraud and deceit to provide for increases in offense levels based on the number of persons that the offender has victimized; and (2) vulnerable victims to provide for increased offense levels based on vulnerability. Amends the Federal sentencing statute to mandate restitution for victims (currently, such authority is discretionary). Expresses the sense of the Congress concerning its support of the National Telemarketing Fraud Working Group. Requires the Attorney General to designate additional existing full-time attorneys and support staff for consumer and anti-fraud activities. Amends civil and criminal forfeiture law to allow for the forfeiture of profits arising from mail, wire, and credit card violations in connection with fraud schemes against the elderly. Allows the use of a percentage of the amounts forfeited to provide restitution to victims. Includes credit card fraud in the money laundering statute. Directs the Attorney General to prepare model State law on the licensing of home repair contractors, mortgage companies, and prize giveaway companies. Includes the use of private courier services in the mail fraud statute."
