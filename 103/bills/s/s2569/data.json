Directs the Secretary of State to seek to enhance the implementation and effectiveness of U.N. resolutions and decisions regarding the moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas through appropriate international agreements and organizations. Requires the President to utilize appropriate assets of the Federal government to detect, monitor, and prevent violations of such U.N. moratoriums."
