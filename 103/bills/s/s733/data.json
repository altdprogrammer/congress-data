    "text": "Comprehensive Child Health Immunization Act of 1993 - Amends the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to regularly contract for the purchase of specified childhood vaccines in amounts: (1) necessary for distribution under the Public Health Service Act to meet anticipated needs and for the maintenance of a reserve vaccine supply sufficient for a six-month period; and (2) which take into account minimum waste due to breakage or other unavoidable losses. Requires: (1) the Secretary to negotiate a reasonable price for vaccines to be purchased; and (2) a manufacturer of such vaccines to provide cost or pricing data in support of the manufacturer's proposed price (and other data whenever the Secretary determines that contract modifications are necessary). Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the confidentiality of such data; (2) the prohibition of additional shipping or handling charges; (3) multiple suppliers; (4) reporting requirements; (5) funding the program under this Act (including establishment in the Treasury of a Comprehensive Child Immunization Account); and (6) termination of the program. Directs that: (1) the term \"early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services\" under such Act include administration of specified childhood vaccines, taking into account the health history of the individual (currently, appropriate immunizations according to age and health history); and (2) payments from State plans to providers include reimbursement for the administration of recommended childhood vaccines. Directs the Secretary to promulgate: (1) a list of vaccines that provide immunization against naturally occurring infectious diseases which are recommended for universal use in children; and (2) recommendations regarding appropriate dosages and ages of children at which each vaccine should be administered. Amends: (1) the Internal Revenue Code to remove a limitation on the use of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund; and (2) the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 to provide for a permanent extension of authority to impose taxes for such Fund. Directs the Secretary to implement a program to ensure participation of all health care providers in a national immunization tracking system."
