Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make program grants to designated Head Start agencies on a seven-year funding cycle (thus requiring existing agency reapplication and recompetition for subsequent grants and designations). Adds continuity of services to selection criteria. Requires an interim evaluation (including a site visit) of each designated agency at least once each year. Authorizes the Secretary to require an agency to correct program deficits, and requires provision of technical assistance for such purpose. Authorizes revocation of the agency's designation and grant if the problem is not corrected in that year, and provides for designation of and grants to another agency to serve the same community. Expands child eligibility criteria for program participation, allowing participation of families that would have been eligible within two years before. Revises notice, hearings, and appeals requirements and procedures. Adds requirements for program outcome measures."
