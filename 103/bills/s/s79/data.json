    "text": "Responsible Government Act of 1993 - Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (FARA) to subject to registration and other FARA requirements foreign agents seeking to influence Federal legislation, executive rulemaking, or the administration of any Federal program or policy through outside contracts with legislative or executive branch officials. Modifies the registration exemption under FARA pertaining to legal representation of disclosed foreign principals. Amends the Federal criminal code to permanently ban former senior executive and legislative branch officials, including former Presidents, Vice Presidents, and Members of Congress, as well as senior military officers, from representing or advising foreign principals. Modifies and extends to : (1) two years the current one-year lobbying ban on representing and advising foreign entities; and (2) five years the current ban on all other lobbying activities (other than those involving the personal and substantial participation of the officer or employee involved, which remain permanently banned) involving former officers and employees of the executive and legislative branches and the District of Columbia, Vice Presidents, and Members of Congress. Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to subject additional executive and legislative branch personnel to financial disclosure requirements under that Act. Provides for forfeiture of Federal retirement benefits for violating requirements for registration as a foreign agent and related financial disclosures."
