Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a management plan for the Area. Requires the Secretary to: (1) protect religious and cultural sites in the Area; and (2) provide access to such sites by Indian peoples for traditional cultural and religious purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to permit timber harvesting for commercial purposes as long as it is compatible with the Area's purposes. Requires preparation of a transportation plan to provide for the most efficient use of existing roads and trails, including a system for dispersed recreation which minimizes its impact on significant archaeological and religious sites. Provides for recreational facilities within the Area and establishes a visitor center. Authorizes the Secretary to permit a utility corridor for high power electric transmission lines and scientific investigations. Prohibits the issuance of any mining location or claim patents after May 30, 1991, with respect to the Area. Permits any party deprived of property rights by such prohibition to file a compensation claim against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Withdraws lands within the Area from U.S. mining, mineral leasing, and related laws. Directs the Secretary to expedite a program to determine the validity of all unpatented mining claims within the Area. Authorizes the Secretary to use mineral materials from within the Area for public purposes. Directs the Secretary to make recommendations to the Congress for possible inclusion in the Area of adjoining lands. Authorizes appropriations."
