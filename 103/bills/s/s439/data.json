    "text": "Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State Governor, if requested by an affected local government and a local solid waste planning unit, to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in: (1) any landfill or incinerator subject to the jurisdiction of the Governor or the affected local government; and (2) landfill cells that do not meet the design and location standards and leachate collection and groundwater monitoring requirements of State law in effect on January 1, 1993, for new landfills. Permits such Governors, without the request of such entities, to limit the quantity of out-of-State municipal waste received for disposal, or disposal of such waste, at landfills covered by exceptions under this Act. Prohibits discrimination against any particular landfill and against shipments of out-of-State waste on the basis of State of origin with respect to limitations and responses to requests by local governments. Exempts from a Governor's authority to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State waste: (1) landfills that received documented shipments of such waste in 1991 and are in compliance with State laws relating to design and location standards, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and post-closure and corrective action; (2) proposed landfills that, prior to January 1, 1993, received approval from the affected local government to receive municipal waste generated outside of the county or State and a State notice of decision to grant a construction permit; or (3) incinerators that received documented shipments of such waste during 1991 and are in compliance with performance standards under the Clean Air Act and State laws relating to facility design and operations."
