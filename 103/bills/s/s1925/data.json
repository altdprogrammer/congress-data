Directs the Secretary of the Interior to use amounts from the Fund to provide financial assistance for worldwide projects for the conservation of rhinoceroses and tigers. Outlines provisions concerning the submission of projects for such assistance and review and approval by the Secretary. Provides sanctions against countries whose activities adversely affect rhinoceros or tiger conservation (such as the trading of rhinoceros horns), including a moratorium on the importation from such country of any fish and wildlife products. Provides for the review and termination of such moratoriums in appropriate circumstances. Allows additional economic sanctions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1995 through 1999."
