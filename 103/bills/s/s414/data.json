    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Brady Handgun Control Title II: Multiple Firearm Purchases to State and Local Police Title III: Federal Firearms License Reform Title IV: Mental Defectives Title I: Brady Handgun Control - Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) require the Attorney General, to establish a national instant criminal background check system (system) for firearm licensees to contact for information on whether receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would violate Federal or State law; and (2) impose, for 48 months or until such system is established, whichever is earlier, a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and procedures for checking with the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the purchaser (police official) for such information. (Sec. 102) Prohibits, during such period, any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer from transferring a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless: (1) the transferor has received a statement of eligibility from the individual, verified the individual's identity, and notified the police official and during the next five business days the transferor either has not received information that the transfer would violate the law or has received notice that the transfer would not violate the law; (2) the individual has presented a statement from the police official that he or she requires a handgun because of a threat to a family member; or (3) applicable State law requires, before any transfer, verification that possession of a handgun by the purchaser would not be unlawful. Requires notified police officials to make a reasonable effort to make the relevant determinations within five days. Prohibits the transfer of a firearm to an unlicensed individual after the system is established unless the transferor has verified the individual's identity and contacted the system and either: (1) the system has provided the transferor with a unique identification number for the transfer; or (2) three business days have elapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that the transfer would violate the law. Permits a transfer (before or after the system is established) if: (1) the individual has presented a permit issued in the past five years by a State that verifies that the individual is legally qualified; (2) the Secretary of the Treasury has approved the transfer under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; or (3) the Secretary has certified that compliance with the applicable background check requirements is impracticable. Requires the destruction of records pertaining to any transfer to an eligible individual. Sets penalties of up to a $1,000 fine, imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for violations of this Act. (Sec. 103) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) determine a timetable by which each State should be able to provide criminal records on an on-line capacity basis to the system; (2) expedite the upgrading of State records in the Federal criminal records system maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the development of hardware and software to link State systems to the national system, and the FBI's revitalization initiatives for technologically advanced fingerprint and criminal records identification; (3) determine, within 24 months, if the links to State systems and the equipment needed to operate the national system are operational, to determine if States representing 80 percent of the U.S. population have met specified reporting requirements regarding incidences and cases of violent crimes, and, if so, to establish the system; and (4) notify each licensee and the chief law enforcement officer of each State upon establishment of the national system. Provides for the correction of erroneous information in the system and for regulations to ensure the privacy and security of system information. Prohibits any Government entity from using the system to establish any system for the registration of firearms, except with respect to persons prohibited from receiving a firearm. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 106) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) to permit the use of formula grants under the drug control and system improvement grant program for the improvement of State record systems and the sharing with the Attorney General of specified records for the purpose of implementing this Act.
