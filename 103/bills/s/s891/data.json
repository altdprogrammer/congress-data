Sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) the privacy and security of the information contained in the system; (2) prohibited uses of such information; (3) identification procedures, once such a system is operational; and (4) penalties for noncompliance. Provides for the establishment by each State of a criminal history system. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) assuring the accuracy of responses; (2) notification of the existence and purpose of the system; (3) operation of the system; and (4) correction of, and remedies for disseminating, erroneous information. Establishes a Federal criminal background check system to which a designated agency in each State is required to report child abuse crime information for purposes of background checks of child care providers. Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for the reporting of such information. Requires the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to begin a study to determine various factors relating to potential child abuse crimes and offenders. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) expedite the incorporation of the remaining State criminal history records into the Federal criminal records systems maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the development of hardware and software systems to link State criminal history check systems into the National Crime Information Center; and (2) take specified other steps to improve access to State criminal records. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the use of funds under formula grants for the improvement of State record systems and the sharing of certain records with the Attorney General. Authorizes additional funding for such purposes. Amends the Federal criminal code to increase the special assessment on persons convicted of offenses against the United States, with a portion of each assessment to be used for purposes of carrying out this Act.
