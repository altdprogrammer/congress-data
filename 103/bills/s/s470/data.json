Prohibits an offense within the jurisdiction of a State from being prosecuted by the United States under such provisions unless the Attorney General (or the highest ranking subordinate of the Attorney General with responsibility for criminal prosecutions) makes a written determination that the offender will not be expeditiously or effectively prosecuted under State law. Requires as a condition of probation granted to an offender under such provisions that the offender participate in counseling, unless the court finds that counseling is not necessary. Requires a court to consider issuing an order enjoining an offender from any contact with the victim for a period of up to ten years."
