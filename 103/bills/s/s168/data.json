    "text": "Regulatory Review Sunshine Act of 1993 - Requires executive branch regulatory review entities to establish procedures to provide public access to specified information concerning each agency rulemaking activity under review. Requires a review entity to transmit to the rulemaking agency: (1) copies of any written as well as all oral communications between the entity and any person not employed by the Federal Government concerning the substance of a rulemaking activity of that agency; and (2) written explanation of any significant review action it has taken concerning such an activity. Requires a rulemaking agency: (1) upon request to identify a rulemaking activity, the date it was submitted for review, and any notice of any extensions of review; and (2) explain in its rulemaking notice any significant changes to such rule as a consequence of regulatory review. Requires a review entity, within 60 days after the receipt of a rulemaking activity, to conclude its review of it. Provides that if the President reviews for resolution an issue arising out of a regulatory review, the review time limits may be extended, although any such issue shall be resolved as promptly as practicable, and such review shall be subject to the public disclosure and agency notice requirements of this Act. Requires a review entity to notify the rulemaking agency of an extension beyond 60 days and provide public notice, and the rulemaking agency to promptly publish a notice in the Federal Register. Requires the Office of Management and Budget to prepare and make public monthly and annual accountings of regulatory review by all reviewing entities. Requires each rulemaking agency to publish in the Federal Register a list of all rulemaking activities undergoing regulatory review during the preceding month. Excludes from coverage under this Act oral communications with the President, Vice President, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, OMB Director, and executive department heads."
