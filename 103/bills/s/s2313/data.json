Prescribes guidelines for allocation and transfer of funds. Title II: Nuclear Power Plant Safety and Security - Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to modify the notification requirements for NRC-regulated facilities that contain a defect or otherwise fail to comply with statutory safety requirements (including those leased by the United States Enrichment Corporation). Includes within such notification requirements Department of Energy (DOE) facilities regulated by the NRC and components supplied by DOE to licensees. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to: (1) modify the civil monetary penalties for violations of rules, regulations, orders, or licensing requirements; (2) revise from annual to biennial the dateline by which the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards must report to the Congress on reactor safety research; (3) permit NRC licensees and the employees of such licensees' contractors to carry firearms at NRC facilities; (4) authorize the NRC to promulgate regulations regarding the unauthorized introduction of dangerous weapons unto facilities within its licensing purview; (5) impose criminal penalties for the sabotage of NRC-licensed production, utilization, or waste storage facilities under construction; and (6) increase the base level penalty for certain violations of a medical therapy license. Directs the NRC to upgrade the professional requirements for persons licensed to possess nuclear byproduct materials for medical use."
