(Sec. 103) Sets forth: (1) requirements for applications, local planning, uses of funds, accountability, and local advisory groups; and (2) special rules for ranking schools within an LEA by need, flexibility, and coordination with Chapter 1 planning.

(Sec. 204) Requires eligible LEAs to use half of their suballotment for programs for school building repair and renovation, and half for programs for school environmental concerns and safety improvements. Authorizes SEA waivers of such requirement. Applies Davis-Bacon Act requirements to such programs.
