    "text": "Allows a member of the armed forces to request and receive separation from the armed forces if such member: (1) became a member of the armed forces before the Department of Defense policy that homosexuality is incompatible with military service is changed to a policy that homosexuality is not incompatible; (2) has not incurred or accepted any new or additional military service obligation after such policy change; (3) is not eligible for retirement from the armed forces; (4) has not previously been approved for separation under any other law; and (5) has religious, moral, or personal morale objections to such change in policy and, within one year, requests voluntary separation. Entitles to voluntary separation benefits active-duty and reserve members who have served for at least six but less than 20 years in the armed forces and who separate from the armed forces under provisions of this Act. Requires separation within 180 days after the appropriate Secretary receives the request, with a delay allowed due to an adverse impact on the readiness of the military department concerned."
