    "text": "Federal Forests Health Recovery Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (or, with respect to specified lands, the Secretary of Agriculture) to prepare for and undertake or authorize forest health activities to: (1) arrest the deterioration in the health of forests and forest ecosystems on Federal lands; (2) restore and maintain the health of the forests and forest ecosystems that have suffered deteriorated health conditions; or (3) ensure the public safety that is threatened by the deteriorating health of the forests and forest ecosystems. Authorizes the Secretary to offer and award a timber sale as a forest health activity if the sale meets one or more of such objectives. Specifies that no sale shall be precluded because the anticipated total costs of the sale are greater than the anticipated revenues. Requires the Secretary to provide to the public a detailed statement of the determination that the activity meets one or more objective whenever the harvest of live trees is likely to occur in carrying out a forest health activity. Establishes in the Treasury a special fund to be used for forest health activities, activities to maintain healthy forests and forest ecosystems (including tree planting), and other specified activities. Provides for funding of specified Forest Service activities. Specifies that a forest health activity that is not inconsistent with the long-term management goals and objectives of a land management plan for the relevant unit of Federal lands shall not be deemed to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Establishes procedures for administrative and district court review of forest health activities. Sets forth provisions regarding budget disclosures, the establishment of advisory boards, and monitoring and reporting requirements."
