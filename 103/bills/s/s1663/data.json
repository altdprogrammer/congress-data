    "text": "Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to remove ephedrine products from the legal drug exemption of the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (which currently precludes the application of any of the regulatory control measures of such Act to a listed chemical which is contained in a drug product approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). Directs the Attorney General to remove from exemption any other drug products which are being diverted to use in the illicit production of controlled substances. Establishes a registration system for distributors, importers, and exporters of listed chemicals which are diverted within the United States. Directs the Attorney General to register an applicant to distribute, and to import or export, a list I (currently, listed precursor) chemical unless the Attorney General determines that registration of the applicant is inconsistent with the public interest, based on specified criteria. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to set penalties for knowingly or intentionally importing or exporting a listed chemical in violation of such registration requirements. Makes provisions of the Controlled Substances Act regarding administrative inspections and authority, forfeiture, and threshold amounts of substances applicable to listed chemicals, as well as to controlled substances. (Currently only the latter are covered by such provisions.)"
