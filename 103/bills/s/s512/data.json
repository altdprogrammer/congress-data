Authorizes Velda Sue to: (1) set conditions under which it will guarantee qualified obligations and securities; and (2) issue securities based on certain pooled interests in qualified obligations. Limits the amount of Velda Sue obligations and guarantees which may be outstanding at any one time. Precludes the Secretary of the Treasury from approving any such obligations or guarantees if issuance would impair the financial safety or soundness of Velda Sue. Directs Velda Sue to issue certification and eligibility standards for secondary marketing for loan poolers. Limits certification to a five-year maximum period. Prescribes the percentages of obligations of poolers which Velda Sue shall guarantee. Directs the Board of Directors to establish standards governing the composition of each loan pool during the period in which Velda Sue guarantees are effective. Outlines the minimum standards for qualified loan pools. Directs Velda Sue to establish fees based upon the risk incurred in providing financial assistance or guarantees for: (1) qualified loans; and (2) securities issued by a qualified loan pooler. Prescribes maximum fee guidelines. Directs the Comptroller General to report annually to the Congress regarding Velda Sue's fee schedule and collection. Grants the Secretary general regulatory power over Velda Sue activities. Requires Velda Sue to publish annual financial status reports. Declares that for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, neither securities nor guarantees issued by Velda Sue shall be deemed to be a government security. Authorizes Velda Sue to issue obligations to the Secretary solely for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations. Authorizes appropriations. Confers original jurisdiction upon the Federal district courts for all civil actions to which Velda Sue is a party. Directs the Comptroller General to perform a financial audit of Velda Sue.
