Title II: Boot Camps and Prisons - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish within the Bureau of Prisons ten military-style boot camp prisons, located on closed military installations, to provide a highly regimented schedule of strict discipline, physical training, work, drill, and ceremony characteristic of military basic training, and remedial education and treatment for substance abuse; and (2) acquire, convert, and operate as regional prisons at least ten former military facilities. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Sentencing Reports - Directs the Attorney General to prepare and make available to the public an annual report on the sentences that were imposed by each Federal judge during the preceding year on defendants convicted of Federal felonies. Amends the Omnibus Act to require the elimination of formula grants to States not requiring that annual reports be submitted on the sentences imposed by each State judge on defendants convicted of State felonies. Title IV: Victim's Right of Allocution - Amends: (1) Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require the Court, before sentencing a defendant for a crime of violence or sexual abuse, to address the victim personally and determine if the victim wishes to make a statement and present information in relation to the sentence; and (2) the Omnibus Act to require the elimination of formula grants to States not providing for a victim's right of allocution."
