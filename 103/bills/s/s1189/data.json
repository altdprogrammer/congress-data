Requires the Corporation to be administered by an Executive Director appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Establishes a Professional Boxing Advisory Board. Sets forth the functions of the Corporation, which include: (1) providing a national computer source for certain boxing information; (2) licensing and certifying boxers, judges, referees, persons serving in a professional role in boxing, sanctioning organizations, promoters, matchmakers, managers, trainers, physicians, and cut men; and (3) charging licensing and registration fees. Requires States that regulate professional boxing to submit boxing plans that meet certain requirements to the Corporation. Establishes in the Treasury the Professional Boxing Corporation Trust Fund. Authorizes State boxing authorities to submit to specified congressional committees a petition: (1) stating that this Act is unnecessary because it has established a similar organization; and (2) requesting a delay of the effective date or repeal of this Act."
