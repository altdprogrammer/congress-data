    "text": "Indoor Radon Abatement Reauthorization Act of 1993 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate areas in which the average radon level is likely to exceed the national average by more than a de minimis amount as priority radon areas. (Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to make available to the public final radon control standards and techniques for residential dwellings, multiunit residential structures, and schools. Directs the appropriate Federal official, before providing any direct Federal financial assistance, to require residential dwellings or multiunit residential structures constructed in a priority radon area later than two years after the establishment of new construction standards, the date of enactment of this Act, or the designation of such area as a priority radon area, whichever is later, to be constructed in accordance with radon control standards. Requires the Administrator to establish a radon design awards program to provide for awards for the best residential design incorporating radon control or mitigation standards. (Sec. 8) Prohibits grants to a State that has local educational agencies that are required to conduct radon tests unless the State provides financial assistance to conduct such tests to agencies that are in financial need. Makes specified activities eligible for grant assistance for radon programs. (Sec. 9) Requires local educational agencies located in priority radon areas to conduct radon tests in school buildings pursuant to the availability of grant assistance. (Sec. 11) Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress a plan describing activities to be undertaken by Federal agencies to assess and mitigate radon in Federal buildings. (Sec. 12) Requires the Administrator and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to promulgate regulations for the disclosure of radon hazards in residential dwellings offered for sale or lease. Directs the Administrator to develop a written document containing radon-related information. (Sec. 13) Prohibits persons from offering radon measurement devices or measurement or mitigation services unless they have completed the EPA radon proficiency program or an authorized State program. Requires the Administrator to: (1) develop a radon reference standard; (2) establish performance standards for radon and radon decay product measurement instrumentation; and (3) make available a list of persons that meet the mandatory radon proficiency program requirements. (Sec. 14) Requires the Administrator to implement an outreach program to provide information about radon to the medical community. (Sec. 15) Directs Federal agencies to assure that new Federal buildings or schools constructed with Federal funds in priority radon areas conform to model construction standards for controlling radon levels. Requires the Secretary to disseminate information on health threats posed by radon and radon testing and mitigation methods to federally assisted housing in priority radon areas. Provides for testing of federally owned housing in such areas prior to the signing of a sales contract. (Sec. 17) Requires the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to study and report to the Congress on the extent of radon contamination in work places. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 21) Extends the authorization of appropriations for technical assistance, grants to States for radon programs, and regional radon training centers. Earmarks funds for radon remediation measures for local educational agencies and for grants to such agencies for reducing radon levels. (Sec. 23) Directs the Administrator to: (1) evaluate existing efforts to promote radon testing in homes and methods to increase such testing; and (2) report to the Congress on the effectiveness of alternative strategies to promote such testing. (Sec. 24) Requires the Administrator to conduct a program to reassess the human health risks associated with radon exposure."
