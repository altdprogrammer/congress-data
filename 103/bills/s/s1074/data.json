Directs the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to: (1) ensure that Department of Commerce programs and policies implement such strategy; (2) establish an environmental technology export promotion one-stop shop at the Trade Information Center; and (3) ensure that Federal offices, including those of the Foreign Commercial Service, which function as one-stop shops for U.S. exporters, also function as environmental technology export promotion one-stop shops. Directs the President to establish an Environmental Trade Promotion Council to develop a national strategy and implementation plan to increase exports of environmental technology, goods, and services (especially in source reduction and energy efficiency). Prescribes guidelines for the establishment of Regional Environmental Business and Technology Cooperation Centers. Authorizes the Secretary to make matching grants to the Centers. Amends the Peace Corps Act to establish the Senior Environmental Service Corps to provide to requesting countries volunteers skilled in environmental management and technology (especially source reduction and energy efficiency), sustainable development, and coastal zone management.
