Establishes a program of grants and contracts for infusion of service-learning into the academic curriculum as a strategy to improve teaching and learning environments in classrooms, schools, and communities.

Directs the Secretary of Education to make such program grants and contracts to State and local educational agencies (SEAs and LEAs) and other public and private entities. Requires the National Diffusion Network to coordinate with the Commission on National and Community Service in identifying and disseminating information on innovative service-learning programs. Title II: Teacher Training - Establishes a program of grants for teacher training in service-learning. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to SEAs for such preservice and inservice training and retraining through subgrants, technical assistance, and assessment for: (1) LEA elementary and secondary school demonstration and exemplary programs; and (2) higher education institution programs not only for elementary, middle, secondary, and vocational school personnel, but also for their own faculty, especially in schools of education. Requires provision for participation of private school teachers. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance, summarize State evaluations biennially for the Congress, and develop model reporting standards. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Amendments to Other Laws - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 to require the regional service clearinghouses to: (1) coordinate with the Secretary; and (2) provide and collect information on school-based service-learning. Authorizes appropriations for such information function. Amends the General Education Provisions Act to direct the Office of Education Research and Improvement to conduct research on experiential-based methods of instruction, such as service learning."
