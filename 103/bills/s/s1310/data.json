Revises breast and cervical cancer screening quality assurance requirements. Allows the grants to be made to tribes and tribal organizations. Includes these changes in evaluation and reporting requirements. Authorizes demonstration project grants to up to three States receiving the cancer grants to provide: (1) additional preventive services, including health education and screening regarding blood pressure and cholesterol; (2) referrals and follow up for women receiving the cancer services; and (3) related evaluations. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the breast and cervical cancer preventive health measures provisions."
