Directs the Secretaries to conduct a survey of the availability of quarters at field units at least every five years. Authorizes the Secretaries to provide suitable quarters under this Act if such survey indicates that government owned or suitable privately owned quarters are not available to the personnel assigned to a specific duty station. Authorizes the Secretaries to: (1) determine that secondary quarters for employees who are permanently duty stationed at remote locations and are regularly required to relocate for temporary periods are necessary for the effective administration of an area; and (2) make such secondary quarters available to employees either on or off public lands. Requires the Secretaries to survey all existing government owned employee housing facilities under the jurisdiction of the Departments of the Interior and of Agriculture to assess physical condition and suitability. Directs the Secretaries to develop an agency-wide priority listing, by structure, identifying those units in greatest need of repair, rehabilitation, replacement, or initial construction and to transmit such survey and listing to specified congressional committees. Specifies that: (1) unless otherwise provided by law, expenditure of any funds appropriated for construction, repair, or rehabilitation shall follow the priority listing established by each agency; and (2) funding available from other sources for employee housing repair may be distributed as determined by the Secretaries. Authorizes appropriations."
