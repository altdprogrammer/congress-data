Amends the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1992 to change \"reimbursable\" to \"nonreimbursable\" with respect to certain Central Arizona Water Conservation District water costs. Makes a technical correction to the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994. Amends the White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act of 1985 to permit a one-time deletion of certain erroneous land parcel determinations printed in the Federal Register. Provides a limited time in which to challenge such determinations. Prohibits new regulations and gives no effect to existing regulations that classify, enhance, or diminish the privileges and immunities of a federally recognized Indian tribe relative to other such tribes."
