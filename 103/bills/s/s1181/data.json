Delineates the compliance procedure for: (1) distributors or networks that propose to exploit a materially altered film; and (2) motion pictures intended for home use through either retail purchase or rental. Grants an artistic author the right to seek injunctive relief in U.S. district courts to prevent violation of his or her rights under this Act."
