Authorizes the Chairman of the Board or other Board members to continue to serve in such positions, upon approval of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, after the expiration of their terms. Requires the Secretary to notify Board members at least 120 days in advance of a decision not to recommend such member for appointment to an additional term. Allows the opportunity for a hearing on such decision. Allows the President to disapprove the appointment of a Board member to an additional term. Provides for reversion to the civil grades and series held by Board members prior to their appointment upon the expiration of their terms of appointment. Directs the Secretary to prescribe criteria for Board member reappointment. Allows current Board members in the Senior Executive Service to continue to be paid at that rate."
