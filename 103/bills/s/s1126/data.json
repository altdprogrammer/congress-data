    "text": "Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act - Defines various terms as used in this Act, including defining: (1) the \"exclusive economic zone\" to extend 200 miles outward from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured; (2) \"fishing\" to exclude scientific research or the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish in an aquaculture operation; and (3) \"State\" to mean Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, the District of Columbia, or the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. (Sec. 4) Mandates a program to support the interstate fishery management efforts of the Atlantic States Marine Commission. Authorizes (in the absence of an approved and implemented fishery management plan under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act) the Secretary of Commerce to implement regulations to govern fishing in the exclusive economic zone that are necessary for implementation of a coastal fishery management plan and consistent with national standards under the Magnuson Act. Applies specified provisions of the Magnuson Act to those regulations. (Sec. 5) Requires the Commission to adopt coastal fishery management plans to provide for the conservation and management of coastal fishery resources. Requires States identified by the Commission to implement and enforce the plan under a time schedule set by the Commission. Mandates a moratorium on fishing in the fishery in question in the waters of a noncomplying State, prohibiting fishing, possession, transportation, sale, resistance to boarding and inspection, and related acts. Imposes penalties, including forfeiture of vessels and fish. (Sec. 8) Authorizes financial assistance to the Commission and the States to carry out their responsibilities under this Act. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act (Sec. 10) Repeals a provision of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act terminating the effectiveness of that Act on a specified date. (Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations to support the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact, the Pacific Marine Fisheries Compact, and the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Compact in developing interstate fishery management plans for interjurisdictional fishery resources."
