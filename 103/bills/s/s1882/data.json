Sets penalties for violations. (Sec. 309) Prohibits a licensed dealer from selling, delivering, or otherwise transferring a firearm from any motorized or towed vehicle or at a location other than that specified on the license. (Sec. 310) Requires each licensee to: (1) respond immediately to a request by the Secretary for information contained in required records relevant to a criminal investigation; and (2) report the theft or loss of a firearm from inventory within 24 hours after discovery to the Secretary, the chief officer, and appropriate local authorities.

Defines \"semiautomatic assault weapon,\" \"Saturday-night-special handgun,\" and \"large-capacity ammunition feeding device.\" Categorizes various brands of weapons. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a prohibited weapon within the definition of \"firearm.\" Requires the serial number of any prohibited weapon manufactured after the date of enactment to clearly show the date on which the weapon was manufactured. Sets penalties for violations. Subjects persons using or possessing a semiautomatic assault weapon during a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime to the same enhanced penalty as for such use or possession of a short-barreled shotgun. (Sec. 402) Prohibits (with exceptions) the manufacture or import of a firearm that does not incorporate a device that: (1) prevents a child of less than age seven from discharging the firearm; (2) prevents a firearm that has a removable magazine from discharging when the magazine has been removed; and (3) in the case of a handgun other than a revolver, clearly indicates whether the magazine or chamber contains a round of ammunition.
