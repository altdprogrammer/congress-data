Makes an individual eligible for assistance under a demonstration project if such individual is a member of a household that meets: (1) the income test of not more than 200 percent of the poverty threshold; and (2) the net worth test of not more than $20,000. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for contributions made to an individual development account by or on behalf of a qualified individual to pay qualified expenses of such individual. Limits such contributions to $2,000 per year. Defines qualified expenses as those for: (1) postsecondary educational expenses; (2) a first-home purchase; (3) business capitalization; and (4) retirement expenses. Makes such accounts exempt from tax, except the tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc. organizations. Declares that contributions to such accounts are not subject to the gift tax or the tax on prohibited transactions. Disregards funds in an individual development account of a demonstration project participant for purposes of all means-tested Federal programs."
