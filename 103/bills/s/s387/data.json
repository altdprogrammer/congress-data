Imposes a two-year moratorium on the patentability of human tissues, fluids, cells, genes or gene sequences, or animals or animal organisms (genetically engineered or otherwise). Authorizes the continuation of such moratorium after such time pursuant to the Public Health Service Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) legislation addressing the implications of genetic research should be thoroughly studied and passed by the Congress as soon as possible; and (2) the Departments of Commerce and State and the National Institutes of Health should work with the international community to develop international standards relating to the patenting of, and access to, genetic information."
