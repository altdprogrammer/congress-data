Title II: Elimination of Sexual Harassment and Abuse - Amends ESEA to make an environment free from sexual harassment and abuse a distinguishing feature of effective schools. Adds to certain targeted uses of funds certain programs of training, technical assistance, and education designed to eliminate sexual harassment and abuse in schools. Adds programs to address sexual harassment and violence as part of efforts to ensure that educational institutions are free from threats to student and employee safety (among programs which may receive Women's Educational Equity assistance). Includes the areas of sexual harassment and assault, depression and suicide, and eating disorders among those for which grants for comprehensive school health education may be used."
