Makes penalties with respect to homicide, attempt or conspiracy to commit homicide, and engaging in physical violence with the intent or result of causing serious bodily harm applicable to persons inside the United States or U.S. nationals while outside the United States. (Current law only applies where such person was a U.S. national.) Increases penalties for: (1) killings other than first degree murders; and (2) attempted murder and for engaging in physical violence with the intent or result of causing serious bodily harm. Title II: Terrorist Alien Removal - Terrorist Alien Removal Act of 1993 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make terrorist activity (as defined by this Act) grounds for deportation. Establishes removal procedures for alien terrorists, including a special removal hearing. Includes as excludable aliens those with respect to whom an appropriate consular officer or the Attorney General knows or has reasonable ground to believe are engaging in, have engaged in, or probably would, after entry, engage in terrorist activity. Grants exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review excludability orders. Provides for a ten-year prison sentence, to run concurrently with any other sentence, and a fine, for entering (or attempting to enter) the United States subsequent to exclusion or removal. Title III: Counterintelligence Access to Telephone Toll and Transactional Records - Authorizes the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain (after submitting a written request) from a wire or electronic communications service provider subscriber information regarding a person or entity which is relevant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation."
