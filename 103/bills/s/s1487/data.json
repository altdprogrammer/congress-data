Makes such suspensions effective until January 1, 1994, or an earlier date specified by the President. Declares that the Congress expects that any extension of the President's authority will be conditional on the PLO: (1) renouncing the Arab League boycott of Israel; and (2) urging the Arab League, and cooperating with efforts by the President, to end such boycott. Provides that this Act supersedes similar provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1994."
