    "text": "Amends the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) to extend the authorization of appropriations for the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Makes numerous miscellaneous and technical amendments to various OSC provisions under WPA, including those regarding OSC administration and powers of disclosure, investigation of prohibited personnel practices and individual rights of action in certain reprisal cases, and OSC reports. Amends Federal law to: (1) make an agency decision to order psychiatric testing or examination of an employee, as well as any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, a personnel action subject to review in whistleblower cases; (2) extend protection against certain prohibited personnel practices to employees of Government corporations; (3) make agency and Government corporation heads responsible for ensuring that their employees are informed of the rights and remedies available under Federal law for whistleblowers; (4) make compliance with merit systems principles a factor in Senior Executive Service performance appraisals; (5) revise the definition of covered position with respect to prohibited personnel practices; (6) permit reasonable attorney's fees in certain cases; (7) allow Federal employees to use circumstantial evidence in seeking to obtain corrective actions; (8) extend whistleblower protection coverage to certain Department of Veterans Affairs personnel; (9) allow the Board to order corrective action that will make the employee whole; and (10) give the MSPB the authorization to receive reimbursement, subject to congressional limitation, from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for expenses incurred in administering Federal retirement appeals. Requires OSC to: (1) issue a policy statement regarding the implementation of WPA; (2) include in any letter terminating an investigation of a prohibited personnel practice the identification of an OSC employee who can respond to questions on the investigations; and (3) conduct an annual survey of all individuals who contact it for assistance. Gives employees of the Resolution Trust Corporation and Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board the option of electing which laws to apply in pursuing remedies in Whistleblower cases."
