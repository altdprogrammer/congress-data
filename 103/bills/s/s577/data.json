Vests in the United States title to those nationally significant lands for which title was not previously vested in the United States and provides for claims for compensation based on such vesting. Ouitclaims the interest of the United States to the lands on the final list and requires the Secretary concerned to issue documents of disclaimer of interest confirming the quitclaims.
