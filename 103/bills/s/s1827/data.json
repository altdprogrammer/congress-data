Directs the President immediately to pursue negotiations to reach such an agreement. Requires the President immediately to impose a 50 percent tariff on all imports from Canada of wheat, durum, and barley. Authorizes the President to terminate such tariff and take action to reinstate the CFTA and the NAFTA with respect to Canada whenever Canada has entered such an agreement. Declares that such agreement shall supersede the corresponding provisions of the CFTA and the NAFTA, and shall be incorporated in and become part of them as reinstated."
