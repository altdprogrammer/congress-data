Title III: Child Support Enforcement - Makes various specified changes with regard to State child support order registries, the Parent Locator Service, regulations for sharing child support information, income withholding orders, and noncustodial parents with child support arrearages who are applying for, or are already on, AFDC. Title IV: Expansion of Statutory Flexibility of States - Amends SSA title IV part A to give States the option to: (1) disallow the increases or decreases in AFDC payments that are mandated by this Act on the basis of childhood preventive health care examinations and immunizations; (2) increase or decrease AFDC payments on the basis of attendance at educational or vocational training institutions; (3) deny AFDC for additional children; (4) provide for a married couple transitional benefit in cases where an AFDC recipient marries an individual who is not a parent of the recipient's child and the resulting family would become ineligible for AFDC by reason of the marriage; (5) treat families moving interstate who apply for AFDC in their new State of residence, where they have resided for less than one year, under the AFDC rules of their former State of residence; (6) condition the receipt of AFDC on the recipient's attendance at appropriate parenting and money management classes; (7) deny AFDC to unmarried individuals under 18 who are pregnant or have a dependent child (if the State does not opt to deny AFDC eligibility in such case, then it must require that the individuals live at home to be AFDC-eligible); and (8) disregard certain savings of a family on AFDC designated for education in determining eligibility for AFDC. (Sec. 401) Requires States to conduct appropriate education and outreach activities designed to increase public awareness of the importance of preventive health care and immunizations for pre-school children. Requires the Surgeon General to issue, and periodically revise, recommendations for the immunization of children under six.

(Sec. 703) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) conduct research projects to evaluate education and training programs with respect to participation in the AFDC program; (2) conduct demonstration projects and report to the Congress on whether providing benefits based on need through the use of electronic cards and automatic teller machines would reduce administrative costs and fraud; and (3) establish a commission to determine the cost and feasibility of creating an interstate system to compare the social security numbers of all AFDC recipients in order to identify those recipients receiving AFDC from multiple States. (Sec. 705) Amends SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) to make: (1) ineligible for SSI benefits individuals receiving SSI on the basis of a disability caused by illegal drugs who are on illegal drugs or refuse to be tested for such; and (2) changes with regard to government agencies as paid representative payees (RPs) and RP fees.
