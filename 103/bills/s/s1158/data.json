Title II: Grants to States - Authorizes the Director of the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) to make grants to States to carry out such projects, giving preference to States providing assurances that: (1) the State corrections and health and human services agencies will participate and cooperate closely in the development and operation of the project; (2) public and nonprofit private community-based organizations will be integrally involved; (3) the State will target economically disadvantaged, incarcerated prisoners and their children for participation; (4) the State has a policy that provides for the placement of prisoners in correctional facilities for which they qualify that are located closest to their family homes; and (5) the State will follow specified guidelines in selecting prisoners to participate. Directs the NIC to make grants on a competitive basis to five eligible States geographically dispersed throughout the United States. Sets forth conditions for grant eligibility and State reporting requirements. Title III: Family Unity Demonstration Project for Federal Prisoners - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) carry out a family unity demonstration project that enables eligible prisoners to live in community correctional facilities with their children; (2) comply with preference and reporting requirements established under this Act; and (3) consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding development and operation of such project."
