Directs the Attorney General to: (1) reject the recommendations of the Commission in whole (in which case recommendations regarding semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices shall be deemed terminated for the year in which they were transmitted to the Attorney General); or (2) accept the Commission's recommendations in whole or in part, and commence a public process for issuing regulations based on such recommendations. Requires the Attorney General to submit the recommendations of the Department of Justice which comprise the final regulations, together with such regulations, to the appropriate congressional committees. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the effective date of any such regulations; and (2) congressional consideration of the Commission report."
