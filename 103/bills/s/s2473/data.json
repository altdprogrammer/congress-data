    "text": "Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations Refinancing Act - Prescribes guidelines under which the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration is directed to refinance a certain appropriated debt by establishing: (1) a new principal amount for such debt; (2) new interest rates for such debt based on long-term Treasury rates in effect as of the date the principal is reset; and (3) a $100 million limit on prepayments of old capital investments before a certain date. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator in FY 1996 and thereafter as long as the Administrator makes certain claim settlement payments to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Directs the Administrator to offer to include provisions in future electric power service contracts that preclude further increases in the refinanced principal amount or interest rate obligations to the Government."
