Earmarks specified sums to be utilized by the Secretaries for Federal and State purposes pursuant to the Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (for National Park Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management land acquisition projects) and the Secretary of Agriculture (for Forest Service land acquisition projects) as part of the Department of the Interior's annual budget submission to the Congress for FY 1995 through 1998, to transmit to specified congressional committees priority lists of land acquisition projects within each agency or bureau which have been authorized by law. Prohibits any one agency from being allocated more than 50 percent or less than ten percent of the funds made available under this Act for land acquisition needs. States that: (1) funds made available pursuant to this Act shall be allocated to projects in accordance with the transmitted priority lists unless modified by law; and (2) no funds shall be made available for the purpose of this Act until after the enactment of the Appropriations Act for the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies for the appropriate fiscal year."
