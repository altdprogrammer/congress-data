    "text": "Forest Biodiversity and Clearcutting Prohibition Act of 1993 - Amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act, and other Federal law to provide for the conservation of native biodiversity in each national forest community. Revises land management guidelines for such forests to prohibit any even-age logging or even-age management. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, on each site already under such management, to: (1) prescribe a shift to selection management; or (2) cease managing for timber purposes and actively restore the native biodiversity or permit each site to regain its native biodiversity. Prohibits extractive logging in specified National Forest areas."
