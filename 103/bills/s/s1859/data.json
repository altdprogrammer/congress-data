    "text": "Breeder Reactor Termination Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to terminate the advanced liquid metal reactor program, including: (1) its promotion of the use of liquid metal reactors for high-level radioactive waste disposal; and (2) Department of Energy (DOE) support for regulatory applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for design certification for advanced liquid metal reactors or related licensed facilities. Reassigns personnel displaced by the program's termination to other activities within DOE. Expresses the policy of the Congress that savings realized from such program termination should be used to reduce the Federal budget deficit."
