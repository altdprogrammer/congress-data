    "text": "Primary Care Workforce Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national policy respecting the number of positions in each State in each approved medical residency training program of the different medical specialties conducted in the State. Limits the total number of entry positions. Prohibits the national policy allowing nonprimary care residents to exceed 50 percent of the total number of medical residents in a State. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide medical education support only if programs are in compliance with the national policy. Establishes the National Health Professional Workforce Advisory Board to make recommendations regarding the national policy. Provides, under the Medicare program, for graduate medical education payments to non-hospital providers operating residency training programs. Increases the authorization of appropriations under the Public Health Service Act for the scholarship program and the loan repayment program. Establishes a program to retrain specialist physicians in primary care. Establishes a commission to study requiring students attending health professions schools pursuant to Federal assistance (for either the student or school) to complete a period of providing service to medically underserved individuals."
