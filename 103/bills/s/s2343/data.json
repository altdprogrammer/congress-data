Provides that, in the case of a person who is a Medicare-eligible individual who receives services in a certified military medical facility, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall be responsible for making reimbursement payments to the certified facility providing such care. Requires the Secretary of Defense to certify to the HHS Secretary a list of all military facilities that meet or exceed Medicare requirements that apply to a public facility, as well as all DOD health plans that meet or exceed Medicare HMO requirements."
