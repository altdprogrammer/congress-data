(Sec. 101) Requires the Strategy to identify environmental requirements based on trends in domestic and global environmental threats and the potential for environmental and economic benefits. Title II: Environmental Technology Initiative - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish: (1) an Environmental Technology Initiative to coordinate and support the implementation of the roles, responsibilities, and goals for EPA pursuant to the most recent Strategy; and (2) an office to coordinate implementation of the Initiative, other related activities, and EPA policies that foster technical innovation. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Administrator, to support the development of environmental technologies, to enter into partnerships with companies for limited periods. Requires special consideration to be given to small business concerns. Limits the Federal share of partnerships to 50 percent of costs except under specified conditions. Provides for the dissemination of nonproprietary research results. Sets aside 25 percent of Federal funding for partnerships for small businesses. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Administrator to enter into partnerships with the heads of executive agencies to develop environmental technologies that will assist EPA and other agencies in achieving their responsibilities and missions. (Sec. 204) Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Administrator to allocate a substantial percentage of funds, with a goal of reaching 50 percent, for multi-agency partnerships. Title III: Environmental Innovation Research Program; Technology Testing - Subtitle A: Environmental Innovation Research Program - Authorizes the Administrator, for each fiscal year, to provide up to 1.25 percent of funds made available to EPA from the Hazardous Substance Superfund for an environmental innovation and research program.

Waives such requirement in unforeseen emergency circumstances. Sets forth program phases. (Sec. 303) Requires the heads of executive agencies to encourage the commercial application of environmental technologies developed to meet agency missions and responsibilities. Subtitle B: Innovative Technology Testing - Authorizes the Administrator to establish a program for testing environmental technology at federally owned facilities and sites, including those on the National Priorities List (under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980) and on the inventory of Federal agency hazardous waste facilities (under the Solid Waste Disposal Act). Requires the Administrator to enter into partnerships with executive agencies and non-Federal partners to carry out such programs. (Sec. 311) Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Additional Programs - Subtitle A: Verification of Environmental Technologies - Requires the Administrator, as part of the Environmental Technology Initiative, to establish a program to verify and disseminate performance and estimates of the capital and operating cost of environmental technologies. Subtitle B: Technical Assistance to Small Business in Coordination with Existing Programs - Directs the Administrator and the heads of other executive agencies to enter into agreements to permit EPA to provide technical assistance and support to the Manufacturing Technology Centers and other similar extension centers administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other technology assistance programs for small business concerns.
