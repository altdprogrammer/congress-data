Redefines \"Federal grant-in-aid programs\" to mean Federal grant-in-aid programs authorized on or before September 30, 1999. Repeals a provision prohibiting the authorization of financial assistance under the Act to be used to finance the cost of: (1) industrial plants, commercial facilities, machinery, working capital, or other industrial facilities or to enable plant subcontractors to undertake work theretofore performed in another area by other subcontractors or contractors; or (2) facilities for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy or for the production, transmission, or distribution of gas (natural, manufactured, or mixed). Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act. Terminates the Act on October 1, 1999, except with respect to the Appalachian development highway system."
