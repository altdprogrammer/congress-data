    "text": "A Better Chance to Learn Act of 1993 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to local educational agencies and community-based organizations to pay 80 percent of the cost of home-based parent and early childhood education programs. Allocates one-half of such grants to new programs and one-half to existing programs. Gives priority to programs that target: (1) early childhood program assistance under the Head Start Act or chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; (2) families that qualify for such assistance, but are not served by such programs; or (3) parents who have limited or unsuccessful formal schooling. Makes an individual eligible to participate if he or she is a parent with one or more children age three, four, or five. Sets forth application and other program requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
