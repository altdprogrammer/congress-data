Requires individuals occupying such positions in excess of 90 days in a calendar year to submit with the head of their agency or component disclosure statements as required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require a consumer reporting agency (CRA) to file with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) when requested a consumer report concerning an individual when the FBI Director has certified that: (1) such records are necessary for the conduct of an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation; and (2) there is sufficient reason to believe that the subject of the report is a foreign power or agent. Outlines information with respect to: (1) identifying information required to be included by a CRA in the report: (2) CRA protection of confidentiality requirements; (3) FBI fee payments for such reports; (4) FBI information dissemination limits; (5) required congressional reports by the Attorney General with respect to all such requests; (6) authorized damages to the consumer for unauthorized receipt or disclosure of such information; (7) disciplinary actions against violators; (8) good faith exceptions for CRA reliance on an FBI certification; and (9) injunctive relief."
