Title III: Consumer Bankruptcy Issues - Permits a Chapter 13 debtor to cure a home mortgage default on his or her principal residence before its foreclosure sale.

(Sec. 307) Declares that a trustee's plan may not modify the claim of a person holding a primary or a junior security interest in real property or a manufactured home that is the debtor's principal residence, except a junior security interest claim where the interest was undersecured at the time it attached (to the extent that it remains undersecured).
