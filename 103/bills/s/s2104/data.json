    "text": "Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish the Department of Energy (DOE) Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program to provide fellowships within DOE, the Congress, and certain Federal agencies to 12 elementary or secondary school teachers of mathematics or science. Sets forth a priority list for any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated for the Program is insufficient to support 12 fellowships. Restricts fellowship awards to teachers who: (1) would bring unique and valuable contributions; (2) are recognized for excellence in mathematics or science education; and (3) demonstrate that a sabbatical leave from teaching will be granted in order to participate in the Program (or that the teacher will return to a comparable teaching position). Vests the Secretary with Program administration authority. Instructs the Secretary to ensure that no local educational agency penalizes a teacher who elects to participate in the Program. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a partnership of DOE laboratories, academic institutions and private sector industries (WERC consortium) to conduct environmentally related education programs (including manufacturing and waste management activities) that have undergraduate and graduate educational training as component programs. Authorizes appropriations for the fellowship Program and for the WERC consortium."
