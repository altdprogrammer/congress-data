(Sec. 101) Extends the obligational authority of the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to make grants for airport development and planning projects through June 30, 1994. (Sec. 102) Limits to a specified percentage the apportionment for primary and cargo service airports if the Congress enacts a law limiting the apportionment for airport development and planning to less than $1.9 billion for any fiscal year. (Sec. 103) Increases the minimum funding for primary airports. (Sec. 104) Sets forth a formula for the reduction of funds not apportioned in any fiscal year for primary airports, cargo service airports, and Alaskan airports. Requires such reduced amounts to be credited to a discretionary fund. (Sec. 105) Sets forth mandates that not less than: (1) five percent (currently, ten) of the funds for airport development and planning be distributed for reliever airports; or (2) 1.5 percent (currently, 2.5 percent) of such funds be distributed for nonprimary commercial service airports and certain noncommercial service public airports. (Sec. 106) Provides as an allowable project cost reimbursable by the Government any airport development and planning costs: (1) incurred during FY 1994, before execution of a grant agreement that is in accordance with an approved airport layout plan and applicable requirements, for project work for which the agreement was previously executed during FY 1994; and (2) where the Federal share of such costs is only paid from sums apportioned for primary an cargo service airports. (Sec. 107) Limits to no more than $200,000 the amount of discretionary funds that may be used by a sponsor of a reliever airport for project costs related to terminal development, including allowable project costs for commercial service airports enplaning up to .05 percent of total U.S. enplanement. Allows the unlimited use of such funds for terminal development at primary airports enplaning up to .05 percent of total U.S. enplanements (small airports). (Sec. 109) Declares that nothing shall preclude the Secretary, after September 30, 1993, from obligating by grant agreement funds which have been recovered by the United States from grants made for airport development and planning projects if they are obligated only for increases in such grants. Title II: Airport-Air Carrier Disputes Regarding Airport Fees - Authorizes air carriers to file with the Secretary complaints alleging the unreasonableness of increased fees imposed upon them by airport operators. Permits airport operators and affected air carriers to submit comments and any related materials to the Secretary with respect to such complaints. Title III: Reform of Air Traffic Control System - Directs the Secretary to undertake a study of management, regulatory, and legislative reforms which would enable the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) air traffic control system to provide better services to users and reduce the costs of providing such services without reducing the safety or availability or structure of the system. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires the FAA to continue to pay quarterly retention allowance payments to certain terminated employees of a FAA demonstration project. Authorizes the Administrator of the FAA to make payment for costs incurred under such project for a specified period. (Sec. 401) Requires the Administrator of the FAA to study, and submit the results to specified congressional committees, of any impediments that may exist in achieving appropriate air traffic controller staffing levels at hard-to-staff facilities."
