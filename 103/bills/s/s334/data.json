Requires any licensee that permits a broadcasting station to be used in a manner not in accordance with such requirement to provide to the candidate to whom the reference was made the opportunity to use, without charge, an equal amount of time. Requires any licensee that permits a person to use a broadcasting station to endorse or oppose a candidate for any Federal elective office to provide equal time to the opposing candidate. Makes this Act equally applicable in the case of an authorized committee speaking on behalf of or against a legally qualified candidate."
