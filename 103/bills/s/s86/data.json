Makes willful violators of child labor provisions who are repeat offenders ineligible: (1) for any direct or indirect Federal grant, contract, or loan, for three years after determination; and (2) to pay a special training wage below the minimum wage rate. Directs the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to make available to affected school districts for posting and distribution the name of each employer who violates child labor provisions or regulations, together with the location and nature of the violation. Prohibits employment of any individual under age 18 who is not a high school graduate unless the employer has in effect a certificate for such employment issued annually with the approval of the minor's parents and appropriate local school officials. Requires employers to notify the State agency when they employ a minor. Requires employers of minors who in the the course of employment suffer death or injury resulting in lost work time of more than three days to provide the State agency with a written description of the death or injury within days after its occurrence. Directs the Secretary to find and declare as particularly hazardous for employment of children between the ages of 16 and 18 the following occupations (among others): (1) poultry processing; (2) fish and seafood processing; and (3) pesticide handling. Sets forth child labor protections relating to migrant or seasonal agricultural labor. Prohibits under the definition of oppressive child labor, employing any person under the age of 14 in agriculture, except where the child's parent owns or operates the farm. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on actions taken to carry out, and the effect of, this Act, including national and State-by-State information on: (1) certificates of employment issued to minors; and (2) reports of deaths and injuries to minors during employment. Title II: Miscellaneous - Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this Act."
