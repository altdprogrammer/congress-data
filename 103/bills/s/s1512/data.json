Requires the Under Secretary for Health of the Department to: (1) ensure that research conducted at such centers includes an appropriate emphasis on the psychosocial dimension of mental illness and on the means of furnishing care and treatment to veterans suffering from mental illness; and (2) disseminate information produced at such centers.
