    "text": "Stormwater Control Reform Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to apply permit requirements to stormwater discharges associated with commercial activity. Exempts, with exceptions, a discharge composed entirely of stormwater from a municipal storm sewer system serving a population of fewer than 100,000 individuals that is located in an urbanized area from permit requirements prior to October 1, 2001. Exempts sources of discharges composed entirely of stormwater from such sewer systems from permit requirements (currently, such exemption is only available prior to October 1, 1994). Provides that permits issued for discharges from municipal storm sewers composed entirely of stormwater shall not require compliance with numeric effluent limitations and water quality standards shall not be applied or enforced as effluent limitations. Authorizes the Administrator to issue a consolidated permit for discharges from a storm sewer system owned by a municipality and the stormwater discharges from industrial or commercial sources owned by the same municipality. Requires the Administrator to establish permit requirements for stormwater discharges from commercial and light industrial sources. Authorizes the Administrator to exempt certain commercial and light industrial stormwater discharges from permit requirements. Directs the Administrator to establish an initiative to fund State and local demonstration programs and research to test innovative approaches to address the impacts of hydrologic and hydraulic changes, source controls, and water quality management practices and controls for runoff from municipal storm sewers. Authorizes appropriations. Makes municipalities subject to stormwater discharge permit requirements eligible for grants to train citizens in watershed monitoring activities to support municipal stormwater management programs."
