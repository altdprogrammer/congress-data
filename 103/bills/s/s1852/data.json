    "text": "Head Start Act Amendments of 1994 - Amends the Head Start Act to reauthorize and revise Head Start programs. (Sec. 2) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish quality standards for Head Start agencies and programs, including standards for performance in providing required health, education, parental involvement, social, and other services, for administrative and financial management, and for facilities' condition and location. Provides for monitoring and for corrective actions or terminations if minimum standards are not met. (Sec. 3) Eliminates a provision freezing regulations. Provides that terminations, reductions, or suspensions of financial assistance upheld in administrative hearings shall not be stayed pending any judicial appeal. (Sec. 4) Revises classroom teacher qualifications and waiver requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance and training to enable Head Start agencies to establish positions for mentor teachers; and (2) review and revise standards for family service workers, and promote model curricula and credentials for such workers. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program of Head Start Fellowships for staff in local Head Start programs and other individuals working in the field of child development and family services. Provides for placement in appropriate settings. Directs the Secretary to develop model staffing pattern plans to guide local Head Start agencies and programs. (Sec. 5) Sets forth goals and priorities for training and technical assistance. (Sec. 6) Allocates funds for program expansion. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to allow certain amounts to be allocated to quality improvement activities (in addition to the required 25 percent portion of appropriations). Sets forth goals and authorized activities for which quality improvement funds are to be used. (Sec. 8) Requires each Head Start agency to coordinate with schools and promote parental involvement to facilitate children's transition from program to school. Directs the Secretaries of HHS and of Education to assess results of demonstration projects under the Head Start Transition Project Act and provide technical assistance to communities to implement promising practices from those demonstrations. Extends the set-aside for the Head Start Transition Project Act. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to carry on a continuing program of research, demonstrations, and evaluations of Head Start programs, and to report on such activities. (Sec. 10) Establishes programs for families with infants and toddlers. Directs the Secretary to make grants for: (1) programs providing family-centered services for low-income families with very young children, designed to promote child development, parental role fulfillment, and movement toward self-sufficiency; and (2) evaluation of, and training and technical assistance for, projects under the Comprehensive Child Development Centers Act of 1988. (Repeals the latter Act because its functions are being consolidated under the Head Start Act.) (Sec. 11) Revises parental involvement considerations with respect to designation of new Head Start agencies well as functions of such agencies. Requires agencies to offer family literacy services and parenting skills training to parents of participating children. Allows agencies also to opt to offer such parents parental social self-sufficiency training, substance abuse counseling, or other partnership in education activities. Requires a family needs assessment, including consultation with the parents, for each participating family. (Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 13) Revises the poverty line definition. Updates hold-harmless provisions for Indian and Migrant programs. Specifies that each Head Start program may use Head Start funds for full-day and full-year services and shall be permitted to provide more than one year of services to eligible children in the State."
