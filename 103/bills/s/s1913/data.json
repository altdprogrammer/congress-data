    "text": "Provides that, until January 1, 1995, it shall not be a misuse to use any pesticide product in a manner inconsistent with specified Federal regulations governing worker protection and pesticide safety that are subject to a compliance date of April 15, 1994. Makes this delay in compliance inapplicable to specific worker protection requirements that appear directly on the label of the pesticide product. Permits workers, until January 1, 1995, to enter areas treated with a pesticide product during the restricted entry interval specified on the product label to perform tasks related to the production of agricultural plants if the agricultural employer ensures that: (1) no hand labor activity is performed; (2) no entry is allowed for the first four hours following the application of the product; (3) no entry is allowed until any inhalation exposure level listed on the product labeling has been reached; and (4) the personal protective equipment specified on the product labeling for early entry is provided in clean and operating condition to the worker. Authorizes employers, for irrigation work for which the only contact with treated surfaces is to the feet, lower legs, hands, and arms, to provide coveralls and chemical resistant gloves and footwear instead of specified protective equipment. Provides that, until January 1, 1995, crop advisors shall not be considered workers or handlers and shall not be subject to Federal regulations governing worker protection and pesticide safety requirements. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) develop and distribute pesticide safety training materials that convey, at a minimum, information set forth in specified Federal regulations; and (2) assist the appropriate Federal, State, and tribal agencies in implementing required pesticide safety training programs."
