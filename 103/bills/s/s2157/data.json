    "text": "Defense Counterproliferation Act of 1994 - Directs the United States to establish an integrated program in the Department of Defense (DOD) to counter potential threats to U.S. interests that arise from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, as well as their associated components, facilities, and delivery systems). Directs the Secretary of Defense to designate the Deputy Secretary of Defense as program manager. Authorizes funds from DOD's FY 1995 appropriations for the program. Establishes a Counterproliferation Program Review Committee to: (1) optimize funding for, and ensure the development and deployment of, highly effective technologies and capabilities for the counterproliferation of such weapons; and (2) identify and eliminate undesirable redundancies or uncoordinated efforts in the development and deployment of such technologies and capabilities. Provides for Committee access to all appropriate information."
