Allows certain funds released to the States for periods in excess of three years of such failure to be used by such States only to carry out programs approved by the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that prevent driving while intoxicated. Provides for the release of all funds previously withheld if the State eventually adopts the blood alcohol level requirement of 0.08 percent or greater."
