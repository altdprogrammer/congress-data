Eliminates provisions which allow certain limited scope audits by banks, similar institutions, or insurance carriers to fulfill the requirement for an audit by an independent public accountant as part of an employee benefit plan's annual report. Requires external quality control review of qualified public accountants for such ERISA audits. Requires notifications of certain events by plan administrators and accountants. Authorizes assessment of a civil penalty against any plan administrator or accountant who fails to provide the Secretary of Labor with any such required notification."
