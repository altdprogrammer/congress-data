    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should: (1) direct that halting the war between Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians and Armenians on one side, and Azerbaijanis on the other, be a high priority of U.S. foreign policy; and (2) immediately launch a new high-level diplomatic initiative to stop the war, based on the Minsk process, including representatives of Russia and other parties to the conflict. Welcomes the Administration's: (1) efforts to provide kerosene, seed wheat, and other urgently-needed humanitarian supplies to Armenia, as well as technical assistance for the transformation to a market economy; and (2) steps taken to extend U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan through non-governmental organizations. Declares that a provision of the Freedom Support Act restricting assistance to Azerbaijan was not intended as an anti-Azeri initiative, is not so viewed today, and should be repealed as soon as Azerbaijani blockades are lifted."
