Exempts the service by a Senator on a congressional committee prior to the 104th Congress. Requires that at least one-half of the Members of the majority and minority parties appointed to serve on a committee during a Congress be Senators who served on that committee during the preceding Congress. Makes it out of order to consider a resolution or take any other action that appoints Senators to serve on a committee in violation of this rule or any other rule of the Senate. Establishes a phase-in formula that rotates membership of Senators among congressional committees."
