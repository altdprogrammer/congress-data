Commends President Clinton for his condemnation of and response to this crisis and the U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, David Rawson, for his efforts in ensuring the safe and swift evacuation of Americans. Calls on: (1) all parties to exercise restraint and control over their forces, accede to and respect an immediate ceasefire, ensure the safety of innocent civilians, guarantee free passage of humanitarian assistance, and recommit themselves to the principles set forth in the Arusha peace accords; and (2) the United Nations (UN) to consider military and diplomatic options which are consistent with the Arusha accords and will ensure the safety of innocent civilians, assist in monitoring an eventual ceasefire or peace agreement, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief, and ensure the viability of these options. Urges: (1) the UN and the Organization of African Unity to continue efforts to gain agreement on a credible ceasefire and to facilitate negotiations between the parties to the conflict based upon such accords; and (2) President Clinton to continue diplomatic efforts to achieve prompt resolution of the crisis in Rwanda."
