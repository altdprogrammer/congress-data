Requires the Clinton administration's steering group on policy toward the new independent States to: (1) immediately conduct a nuclear policy review of the United States-Russia agreement on sales of commercial grade uranium to recommend administrative methods and procedures for achieving access to U.S. markets for Russian commercial grade uranium in a manner that is consistent with U.S. trade law; and (2) propose recommendations for expeditiously resolving the dispute through government-to-government agreements in the context of the United States-Russia summit in January 1994. Requires the President to report to appropriate committees of the Congress on the review and recommendations of the policy steering group review, within 90 days of enactment of this Act if the dispute remains unresolved."
