Urges the President to: (1) join with the Senate in expressing the outrage of the American people over the Haitian regime's attempt to deny democracy to its people; (2) review the compliance of U.S. persons and corporations with the Organization of American States (OAS)-sponsored embargo of Haiti; (3) implement measures necessary to ensure maximum compliance with the embargo; (4) give special priority to preventing oil from evading the embargo; (5) request that the United Nations (UN) Security Council join with the OAS in sponsoring an embargo against the Haitian regime; (6) assist the UN in expanding the number of its human rights observers in Haiti from 40 to 500; (7) establish as U.S. policy that Haitian refugees be granted the same protection afforded to those fleeing other oppressive regimes; (8) urge other Caribbean nations to share the burden of sheltering and accepting Haitian refugees; (9) offer humanitarian assistance to the Haitian people; and (10) develop a long-term U.S. policy toward Haiti which places a priority on building and supporting democratic institutions."
