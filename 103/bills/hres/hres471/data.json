    "text": "Expresses the sense of the House that the Government of Burma (a.k.a. Myanmar) should: (1) immediately release political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi; (2) permit the transfer of power to an elected civilian government based on the results of the 1990 election; (3) respect human rights and end forced labor; (4) allow free and confidential access to prisoners; (5) permit international human rights organizations regular access to villages and detention centers to monitor the repatriation of Burmese victims of illegal trafficking into Thailand for forced prostitution; (6) implement the Memorandum of Understanding with United Nations Commission on Human Rights and take specified steps concerning refugees; (7) respect the 1949 Geneva Conventions; and (8) take law enforcement actions against individuals engaged in illicit narcotics trafficking. Expresses the sense of the House that the President and other U.S. Government officials should: (1) urge the Burmese Government to release Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners; (2) maintain the current ban on nonhumanitarian assistance to Burma and encourage other members of the international community to do so; (3) disperse funds previously appropriated for Burma to support assistance for Burmese refugees and students on the Thai/Burma border; (4) maintain current limitations on bilateral narcotics control assistance to the Burmese Government until it demonstrates a commitment to combating illicit narcotics production and trafficking; (5) continue to oppose loans to Burma; (6) consider imposing further economic sanctions on Burma; (7) support the appointment of a United Nations special envoy to focus on conflict resolution for Burma; (8) maintain the arms embargo against Burma; (9) urge the Government of Thailand to work with the Burmese Government to investigate the involvement of border policy in the illegal trafficking of women and girls into Thailand for forced prostitution; and (10) encourage the United Nations to ensure that its activities meet basic human needs and human rights and do not benefit the military regime in Rangoon."
