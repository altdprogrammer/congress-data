Urges Pakistan to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement authorities to reduce and eliminate the growing heroin trade in Pakistan. Urges the Administration to review the 1993 State Department decision to drop Pakistan from the watch list of nations suspected of supporting terrorism. Reaffirms the validity and wisdom of the Pressler Amendment prohibiting foreign assistance to Pakistan in light of Prime Minister Sharif's public admission that Pakistan has possessed nuclear weapons for several years despite repeated assurances to the contrary to the United States."
