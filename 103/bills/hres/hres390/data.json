Expresses concern over Palestinian casualties inflicted by the Israeli military since the massacre. Urges: (1) all parties to the Middle East peace talks to return to the negotiating table and redouble their efforts to achieve peace; (2) the Israeli Government to take actions to guarantee the safety of the civilian populations in the West Bank and Gaza; (3) the President to support the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to guarantee their safety; and (4) the U.S. Government to become more actively engaged as a full partner in the peace process. Calls for an end to violence against all civilians in the region. Encourages the U.S. Government to: (1) investigate the financial and other connections between Israeli terrorist groups opposed to the peace process and their supporters in the United States to determine whether any U.S. laws have been violated; and (2) prosecute any such violations."
