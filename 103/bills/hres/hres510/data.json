Reaffirms support for the Middle East peace process. Condemns the effort to undermine such process through terrorist acts. Urges all countries and peoples to work actively to bring peace to the region. Urges the President to: (1) unilaterally take action to strengthen sanctions against countries which support international terrorism and to strengthen U.S. efforts against radical Islamic groups which engage in terrorist acts; (2) work to place the issue of international terrorism on the agenda for the next summit meeting of the leaders of the G-7 group of nations; and (3) convene a conference on international terrorism and intensify and coordinate an effective international response and sanctions against countries which support international terrorism. Requests the President to work to bring the issue of international terrorism before the Organization of American States as a priority issue and to provide technical support and assistance to the countries of the Americas to improve their intelligence and investigative capacity to counter threats and acts of international terrorism."
