Supports: (1) pursuing the research and policy initiatives urged in Agenda 21; (2) adoption by the Congress of a system to reallocate an appropriate amount of savings from reduced defense spending to achieve its goals of global environmental protection and sustainable development over the next decade; (3) the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development; and (4) rules of procedure for the Commission which ensure the participation of nongovernmental organizations. Calls on the President to: (1) actively participate in multilateral efforts aimed at creating a more favorable international economic climate for developing countries to practice sustainable development; (2) affirm strong U.S. commitment to the Commission by appointing a high-level representative to the Commission; and (3) submit a national report to the Commission on activities the United States has undertaken to implement Agenda 21 both domestically and internationally, on progress made toward fulfilling other commitments undertaken at UNCED, and on other environmental and developmental activities."
