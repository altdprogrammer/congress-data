Affirms a commitment made to the General Assembly by President Bush to make bases and facilities available to the Security Council for multinational training of forces. Reaffirms that congressional approval of such an agreement will provide the President with full authority to direct the U.S. armed forces to be employed as necessary to support decisions of the Security Council."
