    "text": "Condemns: (1) the Malawian Government's continued incarceration and harassment of dissidents; the restriction on freedoms of speech, press, and assembly; and the repeated, short-term arrests of opposition leaders to impede their prodemocracy efforts; and (2) all efforts by such Government to limit the ability of political parties and popular organizations to campaign in relation to the upcoming referendum. Urges: (1) such Government to consider the recommendations of the United Nations (UN) Technical Team on the Conduct of a Free and Fair Referendum on the Issue of a One Party-Multiparty System in Malawi and to release all political prisoners; and (2) the President and the Secretary of State to ensure that the U.S. development assistance program bears relation to such Government's progress toward an open political system and respect for human rights and that the assistance of other governments and multilateral institutions is directed toward these goals. Commends the actions of the United States and UN in support of democratic change in Malawi and freedom of expression and human rights. Encourages the President and the Secretary of State to work closely with other governments to these ends. Sets conditions for the resumption of assistance to the Government of Malawi, including the release of political detainees, establishment and respect for fundamental freedoms, permitting the unimpeded right to participate freely in the selection of government, and establishment of effective institutions for the protection of such rights. Authorizes the President to waive such parts of the restrictions which are necessary to provide assistance to refugees currently residing in Malawi."
