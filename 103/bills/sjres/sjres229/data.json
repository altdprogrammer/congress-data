Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should have sought congressional approval before deploying such forces; (2) the departure from power of the de facto authorities in Haiti and Haitian efforts to achieve national reconciliation, democracy, and the rule of law are in the best interests of the Haitian people; and (3) the President's lifting of the unilateral economic sanctions on Haiti and his efforts to bring about the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations are appropriate. Supports a prompt and orderly withdrawal of all U.S. armed forces from Haiti as soon as possible. Requires the President to submit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives: (1) a statement of the national security objectives to be achieved by Operation Uphold Democracy and a detailed description of U.S. policy, the military mission and general rules of engagement under which operations of U.S. armed forces are conducted in and around Haiti, including the role of such forces regarding Haitian on Haitian violence, and efforts to disarm Haitian military or police forces or civilians; and (2) changes or modifications to such objectives, policy, mission, or rules of engagement. Directs the President to report to the Congress on the situation in Haiti by November 1, 1994, including a listing of units of the U.S. armed forces participating in, and the estimated duration and costs of, Operation Uphold Democracy. Requires the Secretary of State to report to the Congress on: (1) the participation or involvement of any member of the Haitian Government in violations of internationally recognized human rights from December 15, 1990, to December 15, 1994; and (2) all agreements the United States has entered into with other nations, including any assistance pledged or provided, in connection with U.S. efforts in Haiti."
