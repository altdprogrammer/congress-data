Prohibits such total receipts from increasing by a rate greater than the rate of increase in national income in the second prior fiscal year, unless a three-fifths majority of each House of Congress has passed a bill directed solely to approving specific additional receipts and such bill has become law. Directs the President prior to each fiscal year to submit to the Congress a proposed statement of balanced receipts and outlays. Makes the public debt amount on the first day of the second fiscal year after ratification of this amendment a permanent limit on such debt, unless a three-fifths majority of both Houses of Congress have passed a bill approving such increase and the bill has become law."
