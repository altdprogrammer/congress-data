(Sec. 2) Sets forth recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and credit activity. (Sec. 3) Sets forth the increase in the public debt subject to limitation. Displays Federal retirement trust fund balances. Sets forth Social Security trust fund revenues and outlays for Senate enforcement purposes. (Sec. 6) Sets forth funding levels for each major functional category. Title II: Budgetary Procedures - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets from time to time; and (2) the amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. (Sec. 22) Limits the levels of social security outlays and revenues for this resolution to the current services levels. (Sec 23) Establishes Senate enforcement procedures to continue pay-as-you-go enforcement procedures through FY 2003.
