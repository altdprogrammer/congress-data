Requires the resolution to be accompanied by a report from a committee with jurisdiction over the capital improvement project which shall include: (1) a description of the project; (2) the justification for making the capital improvement; (3) the alternatives considered, including their costs and the reasons for rejecting them; (4) the total estimated costs for the project; and (5) the maximum amount which may be appropriated for the project. Requires an affirmative vote of three-fifths of Members of the appropriate House of Congress to waive requirements of this Act."
