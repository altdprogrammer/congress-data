Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) alternative fees; (2) abolition of grazing advisory boards; and (3) the U.S. share of receipts. Amends the Taylor Grazing Act to revise provisions concerning the use of moneys received from grazing activities to provide for specified payments to local governments and to limit the uses of such moneys. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the term of grazing permits; and (2) non-grazing uses. Prohibits subleasing (i.e., the grazing, on public lands or on National Forest lands covered by a grazing permit, of domestic livestock which is not both owned and controlled by the holder of of the grazing permit)."
