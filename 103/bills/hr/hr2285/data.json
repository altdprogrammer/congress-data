Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make certain reports with respect to: (1) the operation of the telephone hotline; and (2) the difficulties veterans encounter in obtaining from the Department determinations that disabilities relating to sexual trauma are service-connected. Modifies responsibilities of Department coordinators of women's services. Requires the Secretary to ensure that such coordinators are provided sufficient resources to carry out such responsibilities."
