(Sec. 303) Amends Federal bankruptcy law to modify the guidelines under which a lien shall be considered to impair an exemption. (Sec. 304) Provides that a petition in bankruptcy does not operate as an automatic stay with respect to an action or proceeding for: (1) the establishment of paternity; or (2) the establishment or modification of an order for child or spousal maintenance or support.

(Sec. 312) Amends Federal criminal law to set additional penalties for specified fraudulent activities perpetrated in connection with bankruptcy proceedings. (Sec. 313) Amends Federal bankruptcy law to proscribe discriminatory treatment of student loan applicants who have been debtors under its aegis.
