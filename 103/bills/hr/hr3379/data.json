Permits up to four subsequent interim extensions. Requires any interim extension to terminate at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the product involved receives permission for commercial marketing or use unless the applicant submits specified additional information not previously contained in the interim extension application in which case the patent shall be extended for up to five years from the expiration date of the original patent term."
