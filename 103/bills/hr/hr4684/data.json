Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) enter into negotiations with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) regarding U.S. participation in the planning and construction of the Large Hadron Collider project; (2) submit an operations plan to certain congressional committees subsequent to enactment of appropriations for DOE high energy or nuclear activities; (3) contract with an independent organization to review the governance of DOE high energy and nuclear physics programs; and (4) report to the Congress on a mandated long-range plan prepared jointly with the Director of the National Science Foundation regarding Federal high energy and nuclear physics programs based on current and projected funding levels. Mandates that each of the President's annual budget requests for DOE high energy and nuclear physics activities distinguish between the budget for capital expenditures and other activities."
