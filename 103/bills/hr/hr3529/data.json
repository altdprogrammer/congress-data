Directs the President, based on the Secretary's recommendations, to periodically select companies and other organizations which have benefited the United States through the development and deployment of environmental technologies for receipt of the Award. Establishes a National Environmentally Sound Technology Award for individuals who have pioneered the development and use of a highly innovative environmental technology. Directs the Secretary to receive and evaluate applications for, and provide for presentation of, the Award. Makes U.S. citizens or permanent residents eligible for the Award. Permits up to five of such Awards to be presented annually."
