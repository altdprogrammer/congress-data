Authorizes Federal regulatory agencies to exempt from such disclosure requirements an advertisement or solicitation made by a broadcast or electronic medium or outdoor advertising display which is not on the premises of a financial intermediary. Prohibits misleading or inaccurate advertisements or solicitations. Prescribes disclosure guidelines under which financial intermediaries are required to maintain and distribute to a consumer a schedule of investment product fees, interest rates, and terms. Prescribes guidelines for the calculation and payment of interest-earning accounts. Mandates clear and conspicuous disclosure on each investor's periodic statements of the: (1) annual percentage yield earned; (2) amount of earnings; (3) amount of fees imposed; and (4) number of days in the reporting period. Requires the appropriate Federal agency to prescribe implementing regulations. Prescribes civil liability guidelines for violations of this Act."
