Conditions such assistance on the President's certification to the Congress that the IAEA is taking steps to implement such reforms. Requires the President to direct the U.S. representatives to the IAEA to work toward the early adoption of reforms, including: (1) improving access to nuclear facilities within non-nuclear weapon states; (2) increasing the transparency of internaional nuclear commerce; (3) improving access to information about nuclear activities of IAEA member states; and (4) examining the advisability of conducting less frequent inspections at nuclear facilities in member states which consent to short notice, unrestricted inspections and which accept construction or modification safeguards and agree not to place certain limitations on inspectors. Authorizes additional appropriations."
