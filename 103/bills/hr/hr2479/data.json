Sets forth matching requirements and authorized uses of grants. Prohibits States from providing grants to public entities or other units of general local government unless such entities or units have local lead-based paint laws in effect. Permits the expenditure of grant amounts only in accordance with an approved plan that sets priorities for lead risk assessment and abatement in rental housing and in owner-occupied housing occupied by children and pregnant women. Requires the certification of personnel conducting assessment and abatement activities. Bars the use of more than 20 percent of a grant for emergency measures. Limits assistance to small nonprofit organizations and businesses for performing such activities to one percent of the grant amount. Provides for the continued use of eligible residential units at which lead abatement activities are carried out as affordable housing. Permits grant amounts to be expended for abatement activities for an eligible unit only if the eligible public entity has entered into an agreement with the unit owner that: (1) provides for the abatement activities to be carried out; (2) establishes a lien (held by the public entity) on the unit to ensure compliance with affordable housing requirements; and (3) provides penalties for the breach of the agreement. Sets forth elements of plans required to be submitted by public entities as a condition of receiving grants. Establishes formulas for the determination of allotments. Authorizes appropriations from the Lead Abatement Trust Fund to carry out this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax of 45 cents per pound on: (1) lead removed from any U.S. smelter; and (2) lead and lead in any taxable lead product entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. Provides a credit or refund for tax paid on lead or lead products that were exported. Establishes the Lead Abatement Trust Fund."
