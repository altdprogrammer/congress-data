(Currently, such notification and disapproval guidelines apply only to storage capacity of specified minimum tonnage.) Expedites from three years to one year mandatory removal of such fuel from the interim storage facility. Applies the notice and disapproval guidelines to contracts or obligations in effect before January 7, 1983."
