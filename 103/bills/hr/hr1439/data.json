    "text": "Healthy Students-Healthy Schools Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to designate, within the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a Healthy Students-Healthy Schools Office (HSHS Office). Requires the HSHS Office to assist State and local educational agencies (SEAs and LEAs) to develop and maintain comprehensive sequential school health education programs and curricula in all elementary and secondary schools in their jurisdiction. Requires the Office also to assist States in coordinating school-based programs to progress toward relevant Healthy People 2000 (HP 2000) Objectives and Healthy Students-Healthy Schools Goals (Goals). Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to transfer the Office of Comprehensive School Health Education (CSHE Office) from the Office of the Secretary (of Education) to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (also within the Department of Education). Establishes the Healthy Students-Healthy Schools Advisory Council, which shall establish the national Goals. Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a Healthy Students-Healthy Schools Interagency Task Force. Sets forth the duties of the Secretary of HHS under this Act. Directs the Secretary of HHS, through the HSHS Office, to award grants to States and LEAs to assist schools in becoming Healthy American Schools that teach comprehensive sequential school health education programs using advanced technologies such as computer-based learning and innovative communication channels. Directs the Secretary of HHS to recognize annually with plaques and cash awards those schools that epitomize the HSHS Goals. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and in cooperation with the Secretary of HHS, to develop and implement a program providing sequential comprehensive health education and physical education to students enrolled in elementary and secondary schools operated by or on behalf of the BIA. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 to allow appropriations under it to be used in conjunction with HSHS program, so long as substance abuse prevention is a major component."
