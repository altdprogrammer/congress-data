Sets forth the criteria for basic transactions service accounts and government check cashing services accounts. Requires a depository institution to conspicuously disclose the availability of such accounts in its public areas. Directs the Board to prescribe regulations which require certain depository institutions to disseminate such information in multi-language notices. Requires certain credit unions to offer such basic financial services accounts. Exempts certain depository institutions from the requirements of this Act. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) fraud prevention and administrative enforcement; and (2) civil liability for noncompliance with this Act by a depository institution."
