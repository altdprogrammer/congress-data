Directs the head of each executive department to designate a travel supervisor. Specifies the travel supervisors for the legislative and judicial branches. Requires all Government travel to be: (1) approved in advance by the appropriate travel supervisor; (2) accomplished by the most economical means conveniently possible; and (3) accomplished by U.S. commercial carrier wherever possible. Requires all legislative branch foreign travel, with specified exceptions, to be approved in advance by recorded vote of the committee (in the case of travel by a committee member or committee staff) or by the appropriate travel supervisor. Requires each travel supervisor to establish written guidelines for Government travel and to submit quarterly reports with respect to such travel to the Administrator of General Services (for executive branch or independent agency travel), the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate (for legislative branch travel), and the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (for judicial branch travel)."
