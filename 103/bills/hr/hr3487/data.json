Authorizes the Secretary to implement a plan for assuming the disability determination function of a State when it notifies the Secretary that it no longer wishes to perform the function. (Sec. 102) Converts to employment with the Department of Health and Human Services State employees whose disability determination function is assumed by the Secretary. (Sec. 103) Eliminates survivor benefits which are payable solely on the basis of \"currently insured\" status. (Sec. 104) Requires a report to the Congress by the Secretary regarding certain demonstration projects piloting case management techniques in the SSA title II program. Title II: Establishment of Social Security Court and Abolition of Appeals Council - Establishes the Social Security Court (Court) which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over actions arising under SSA titles II, XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and XVIII (Medicare). Authorizes any individual who was a party to a hearing to which the Secretary has rendered a final decision to bring a timely action for Court review of the decision. Authorizes the Court to affirm, modify, or reverse the decision, but restricts its authority to reconsider factual findings. (Sec. 202) Amends SSA title VII (Administration) to provide for the President's appointment of judges to the Court. Authorizes the chief judge to divide the Court into divisions so that claimants have an opportunity to appear before the Court anywhere within the country. Provides that within 60 days of a division's decision such decision shall become final unless, within that period, a party petitions for review. Gives the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review Court decisions upon an appeal, but prohibits an appeal until the Court has reviewed or denied a petition for review. (Sec. 203) Abolishes the Department's Appeals Council without limiting the Secretary's authority to hold hearings and conduct investigations."
