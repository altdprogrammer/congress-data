Amends the Standing Rules of the Senate and the Rules of the House of Representatives to require a three-fifths vote in each House before it considers legislation that creates a requirement of general applicability but exempts the Congress from such provisions. Authorizes the House and the Senate to promulgate regulations governing the indemnification of congressional employers for damages or equitable liability assessed against such employer under this Act for conduct not within the control of such employer."
