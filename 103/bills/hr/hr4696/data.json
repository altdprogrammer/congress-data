Authorizes health care practitioners to provide any method of treatment to such an individual if: (1) there is no evidence that the treatment is a danger to the individual; (2) in the case of treatment that is the administration of a food, drug, or device that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the individual has been informed that the treatment has not been approved and the food, drug, or device contains a warning to that effect; (3) the individual has been informed of the nature of the treatment; (4) there have been no claims, including advertising and labeling claims, made with respect to the efficacy of such treatment; and (5) the individual desires such treatment and has been provided and has signed a written statement that such individual has been fully informed with respect to such information. Requires a practitioner, after administering such treatment and discovering it to be a danger to an individual, to submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorizes the introduction or delivery into interstate commerce of medication or equipment for use in accordance with this Act. Prohibits a licensing board from denying, suspending, or revoking the license of a health care practitioner solely because such practitioner provides treatment described by this Act."
