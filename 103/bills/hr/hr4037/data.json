Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a State, to add new NHS segments (including intermodal connections) and to delete existing route segments and connections if the total NHS miles do not exceed 165,000 miles. Requires: (1) the State to establish that the requested route changes have been indentified cooperatively with local officials through the metropolitan and statewide transportation planning processes; and (2) the Secretary to determine that the requested changes meet criteria established for, and enhance the national transportation characteristics of, the NHS."
