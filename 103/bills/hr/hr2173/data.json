Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a national standard for the disposal of sediments contaminated with dioxin. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary of the Army to develop and submit to the Congress a plan for: (1) the construction of a containment island as an alternative to the Mud Dump Site in New Jersey for the disposal of contaminated dredged material; and (2) the containment, clean-up, and prevention of dioxin contamination in the Passaic River basin in the vicinity of Newark, New Jersey. Authorizes the Secretary to approve the establishment of a consortium of permittees for the testing, permitting, and disposal of dredged materials to promote the cost-effective disposal and environmental management of dredged materials."
