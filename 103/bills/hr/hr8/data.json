(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance to schools and other entities to ensure compliance with nutritional requirements under the school lunch program, summer food service program for children, and child and adult care food programs. (Sec. 103) Requires that minimum nutritional requirements be based, at a minimum, on the weekly average nutrient content.

(Sec. 105) Establishes a universal school lunch and breakfast pilot program, under which schools meeting certain requirements may serve free breakfasts and lunches to all children and receive a flat rate of reimbursement for all meals. (Sec. 106) Sets forth procedures relating to filing of reimbursement claims. Requires negotiated rulemaking before issuance of regulations for nutritional and compliance requirements. Permits States and local school food authorities to request waivers of certain requirements from the Secretary, in order to improve program operation. (Sec. 107) Revises and reauthorizes the summer food service program for children. Establishes priorities for determining participation of certain eligible service institutions. Eliminates: (1) the one-year waiting period for participation of private nonprofit organizations replacing school or government sponsors; and (2) the warning in private nonprofit organization applications relating to criminal provisions and related matters. Extends such program's authorization of appropriations. (Sec. 108) Reauthorizes the commodity distribution program.

Title II: Amendments to Child Nutrition Act of 1966 - Amends CNA to direct the Secretary to: (1) provide technical assistance to schools to comply with nutritional requirements under the school breakfast program; and (2) establish a program to promote the school breakfast program. Reauthorizes, permanently, the school breakfast startup grant program. Allows a portion of startup program funds to be used for school breakfast program expansion grants.

Provides that a State will not incur interest liability to the Federal Government on rebate funds for infant formula and other foods if all such interest is used for program purposes.
