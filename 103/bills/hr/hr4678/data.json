Prohibits the offering of amendments in the House of Representatives or the Senate that increase or decrease spending in any functional category unless a statement has been inserted in the Congressional Record that identifies the specific program, project, or activity that is to be increased or decreased. Expresses the sense of the House that during consideration of a concurrent resolution on the budget in the Committee of the Whole, the Committee on Rules should allow specific amendments to increase or decrease particular functional categories and not only amendments in the nature of a substitute."
