    "text": "Clean Water Act Research Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to revise the authorized activities of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to water pollution control and investigations. Establishes a National Water Quality Research Committee to advise the Administrator on research activities. Requires the Committee to report annually to the Congress on: (1) research conducted in the preceding year; (2) highest priority research needs for the following five-year period; (3) planned research activities; and (4) opportunities to coordinate Federal and State research. Establishes a Water Quality Monitoring Council to ensure the coordination of Federal and State surface and groundwater quality monitoring programs. Directs the Administrator to conduct a program of research and development of methods for the control of nonpoint sources of pollution. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a national survey of data regarding bottom sediment contamination; and (2) conduct a program of research and development of methods for improved remediation and control of pollution problems resulting from contaminated sediments. Directs the Administrator to conduct a program of research and investigation concerning groundwater quality. Requires the Administrator to: (1) conduct a program of research and development to improve understanding of the status and trends of ecosystems and to develop improved predictive models upon which to base standardized protocols; and (2) issue protocols based on such program for use by States in conducting water quality assessments. Directs the Administrator to conduct a research technology development and demonstration program to identify and demonstrate cost-effective preventive measures for sources of pollution in complex watersheds having a mix of land use types. Requires the Adminstrator to conduct a basic research, development, and demonstration program for wetlands. Revises provisions concerning grants for research and development to require the Administrator to establish a grant program to demonstrate practices for the prevention and control of industrial and municipal sources of water pollution. Authorizes appropriations."
