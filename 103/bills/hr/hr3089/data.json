Provides for the development, modernization, and operation of new and existing research centers in family care and primary care. Mandates an advisory council. Title II: Incentives for Rural Physicians Regarding Primary Care - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for medical education loan interest that accrues while a physician is providing primary care or obstetrical and gynecological services in a medically underserved rural area and living in that area. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 with regard to the Stafford Federal Student Loan Program to defer principal payments and with regard to the Perkins Direct Student Loan Program to defer principal and interest payments while the borrower is serving in an internship or residency program in preparation for practice in primary care or obstetrics and gynecology. Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to modify requirements regarding substitute billing arrangements. Title III: Primary Care Physicians Under Approved Medical Residency Training Programs - Mandates a national policy that at least 50 percent of entry positions in medical residency training programs be in primary care. Allows waiver for a State if application of the general rule would not be practicable. Amends Medicare provisions to tie to that policy Medicare payments to hospitals for direct graduate medical education costs and for indirect costs of medical education. Establishes the National Health Professional Workforce Advisory Board to make recommendations on: (1) the distribution of such positions among primary and non-primary care residents at various sites; (2) the supply and role of non-physician primary care providers; and (3) the appropriateness of spending Medicare direct graduate medical education funds available for the clinical training of physicians and nurses for the clinical training in primary care of additional practitioners. Repeals provisions of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 establishing the Council on Graduate Medical Education. Mandates annual publication of a list of the total amount of payments made to each hospital in the United States during the previous year under Medicare provisions relating to direct graduate medical education costs."
