Authorizes the Secretary to work with others to develop a sustainable development strategy for the Gulf. Permits Federal officials who appoint Task Force members to make grants to the Council for programs related to the conservation of the Gulf's natural resources or to sustainable economic development in the Gulf region. Limits the total amount of annual grants.
