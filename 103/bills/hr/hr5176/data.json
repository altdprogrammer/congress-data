Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from granting a modification unless such modification will result in removal of at least 58 percent of the biological oxygen demand (on an annual average) and at least 80 percent of total suspended solids (on a monthly average) in the discharge to which the application applies."
