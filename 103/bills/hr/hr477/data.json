Requires additional General Accounting Office reports to the Congress concerning the financing of overtime inspectional services through user fees. Authorizes hazardous duty differentials to be paid to customs officers. Makes certain customs employees eligible for the special rates and locality pay adjustments under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 that are applicable to Federal law enforcement officers.
