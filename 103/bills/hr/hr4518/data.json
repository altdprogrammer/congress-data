    "text": "FTC Order Review Procedure Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to require the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), each January, to publish in the Federal Register a list of all final FTC antitrust and consumer protection orders issued that are in effect and that have been final orders of the FTC for a period of ten years or more. Requires that any FTC order which has been final for more than ten years be set aside in response to an FTC petition for a proceeding for its termination unless the FTC determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the continuation of the relevant market conditions or conduct following entry of the order require it to remain in effect. Makes exceptions where such order enjoins conduct subject to per se condemnation under the Sherman Act or is issued to protect the public from fraudulent conduct, or is based on an FTC finding based on a preponderance of the evidence that there is a high probability that the kind of conduct which resulted in the FTC issuing the order is likely to recur. Requires any FTC order issued after the date of enactment of this Act to include a provision which terminates the order ten years after it becomes final, unless it is an order which enjoins such conduct or is based on such a finding. Requires that, after the date of enactment, any court ruling that enforces, amends, or supplements an FTC order that has been terminated pursuant to this Act be vacated upon the filing of a petition in the relevant court which truthfully asserts that the related FTC order has been terminated and which requests that the court ruling be vacated."
