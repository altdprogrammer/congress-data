Adds veterans who served on active duty after the Vietnam era and certain other veterans to a study by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs concerning unemployment among veterans. Adds to a veterans' employment emphasis under Federal contracts of $10,000 or more for the procurement of personal property and non-personal services veterans who served on active duty during a war in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized. Requires veterans employed under the preference to be included in certain contractor reporting requirements. Disregards amounts received by eligible veterans under the all-volunteer force basic educational assistance program and the educational assistance program for enlisted members of the Selected and Ready Reserves in determining eligibility of veterans under Federal employment and training programs."
