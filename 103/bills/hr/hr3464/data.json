    "text": "Comprehensive Arson Deterrence and Fire Containment Act of 1993 - Authorizes appropriations for the modernization or replacement of the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System used by the United States Forest Service. Directs the Forest Service to study and report to the Congress on additional means of improving airborne fire fighting response time, including whether there are any legal impediments which materially delay fire fighting response reaction time. Increases penalties for the malicious use of fire or an explosive if: (1) the damage caused by the offense exceeds $1 million (between five and 20 years' imprisonment); (2) the life of any person is placed in jeopardy as a result of the offense or the damage caused exceeds $10 million (between eight and 30 years' imprisonment); (3) personal injury results to any person or the damage caused exceeds $25 million (between ten and 40 years' imprisonment); and (4) death of any person results (over 25 years' imprisonment, life imprisonment, or the death penalty). Sets forth: (1) analogous provisions regarding malicious use of fire or an explosive to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting such commerce; and (2) penalties for reckless or negligent use of fire or an explosive. Directs the Forest Service to study and report to the Congress on whether there are any Federal legal impediments that prevent homeowners, local governments, and other interested parties from clearing highly flammable fire hazards, including brush weeds, that may provide fuel for dangerous fires. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress on: (1) how greater use could be made of excess military cargo planes, other plans available to the Forest Service, and private fire fighting contractors; and (2) how to reform Federal aviation regulations to allow full effective use of such planes for fire fighting purposes."
