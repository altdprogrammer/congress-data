    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Intelligence Activities Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Title III: General Provisions Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency Title V: Additional Technical Amendments Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1994 for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (2) Department of Defense (DOD); (3) Defense Intelligence Agency; (4) National Security Agency; (5) National Reconnaissance Office (NRO); (6) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (7) Department of State; (8) Department of the Treasury; (9) Department of Energy; (10) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (11) Drug Enforcement Administration; and (12) Central Imagery Office. (Sec. 102) Specifies that: (1) the amounts authorized to be appropriated for such activities and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 1994, for the conduct of such activities, are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations; and (2) such Schedule shall be made available to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and to the President. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to authorize employment for a limited number of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY 1994 when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires notice to the Intelligence Committees. (Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Community Management Account of the DCI. Authorizes for such Account 222 full-time personnel as of September 30, 1994. Requires Federal officers or employees, or members of the armed forces, detailed to the Community Management Staff to be detailed on a reimbursable basis, except for temporary details of less than one year. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1994. (Sec. 202) Makes technical corrections to the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act (CIARA). (Sec. 203) Authorizes retirement annuities, survivor annuities, and access to health insurance benefits for certain ex-spouses of participants in the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS). Allows eligible persons who divorced a participant in CIARDS on or before December 4, 1991, to qualify for such benefits starting on October 1, 1994. (Sec. 204) Corrects references to CIARA found in the Intelligence Authorization Act, FY 1990, the Foreign Service Act of 1980, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Social Security Act. Title III: General Provisions - Specifies that: (1) appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for Federal employees may be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law; and (2) the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 303) Revises provisions of the Federal Employees Comparability Act of 1990 to provide that: (1) the total pay of an employee of the FBI assigned to the New York Field Division before September 29, 1993, in a position covered by a certain demonstration project conducted under the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1989, shall not be reduced as a result of the termination of such project while the employee remains so employed after that date; and (2) beginning September 30, 1993, any periodic payment under that Act for any such employee shall be reduced by the amount of any increase in basic pay. (Sec. 304) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the DCI to submit to the Congress an unclassified annual report on the activities of the intelligence community. (Sec. 305) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the DCI, Secretary of Defense, and Director of the Information Security Oversight Office should conduct required reviews relating to the protection of national security information and security practices and procedures at DOD and the CIA with maximum consultation with each other; and (2) the results of such reviews should be incorporated into a consolidated recommendation for the President. (Sec. 306) Directs the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the DCI to jointly submit to the Congress a report on U.S. Government programs to counter terrorism. (Sec. 307) Requires the DCI and the Secretary of Defense to jointly prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a report: (1) identifying and assessing the critical gaps between the information needs of the Government and intelligence collection capabilities and gaps in the ability of the intelligence community to provide intelligence support needed by the U.S. armed forces (and, in particular, by commanders of combatant commands); and (2) containing joint recommendations on appropriate means, including specific budgetary adjustments, for reducing or eliminating such gaps. (Sec. 308) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the DCI should continue to direct that elements of the intelligence community, whenever compatible with national security, consistent with the operational and security concerns, and fiscally sound, should award contracts in a manner that maximizes the procurement of products made in the United States. (Sec. 309) Amends the National Security Act to provide that the general authorization for any funds necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions and purposes of the Act does not satisfy the requirement that there be a specific authorization by the Congress in order for intelligence agencies to obligate or expend funds available to them. (Sec. 310) Deems funds obligated or expended for the Accelerated Architecture Acquisition Initiative of the Plan to Improve the Imagery Ground Architecture based upon the notification to the appropriate congressional committees by the DCI, dated August 16, 1993, to have been specifically authorized by the Congress. (Sec. 311) Provides for the transfer of amounts in the National Security Education Trust Fund (established pursuant to the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991) in excess of $120 million to the U.S. Treasury. Directs the Secretary of Defense to consult with the members of the National Security Education Board during the preparation of the required annual report. Requires each such member to submit to the Secretary an assessment of their hiring needs in the areas of language and area studies and a projection of the deficiencies in such areas. Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency - Authorizes the DCI to award cash prizes and visits to the CIA for students who participate in high school science fairs within the United States. Title V: Additional Technical Amendments - Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 and the National Security Act of 1947. (Sec. 603) Codifies section 406 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1993 (prohibiting the disclosure of the name, title, or salary of any person employed by, or assigned or detailed to, the NRO or the disclosure of the number of such persons, with exceptions)."
