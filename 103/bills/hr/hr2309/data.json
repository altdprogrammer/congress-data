Permits the extension of existing loan terms by agreement of the loan parties. Authorizes revolving funds to be used to make grants to municipal and intermunicipal agencies, subject to consideration of specified factors. Revises State allotment provisions, requiring the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish an allotment formula that considers: (1) the needs of each State for assistance; (2) the projected percentage increases in residential and commercial sewer and water bills in the State; and (3) the extent to which local economies can contribute financially to water pollution control projects. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the revolving fund program through FY 2000."
