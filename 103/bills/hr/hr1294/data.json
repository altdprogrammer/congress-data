Requires such designations to be made within 60 days after the recommendation for installation closure or realignment. Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to prohibit the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in the case of each military installation designated as either an enterprise zone or a redevelopment area, from identifying buildings or other properties at such installation as suitable for housing for the homeless until: (1) such Secretary certifies to the Congress that such buildings or properties are no longer being considered for commercial uses as an enterprise zone; and (2) the Secretary of Commerce makes the same certification with respect to such use as a redevelopment area."
