Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to extend Federal milk marketing order authority. Amends Federal law to extend the dairy indemnity program. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the dairy export incentive program. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to extend the Secretary's requirement to estimate Commodity Credit Corporation milk and milk products purchases, but stipulates that such estimates be made prior to Pool effects or purchase price revisions are determined.
