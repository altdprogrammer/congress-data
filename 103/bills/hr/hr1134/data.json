Modifies the boundaries of the Arapaho National Forest, Colorado, to include certain lands conveyed to the Secretary of Agriculture. Withdraws the public lands transferred to Colorado and the local governments from U.S. mining and mineral leasing laws. Requires the consent of the Secretary before the grantee or its successor can transfer the title of such conveyed lands. Makes the grantee liable to the Secretary for the fair market value of such conveyed lands if such lands are devoted to a use inconsistent with limitations under this Act or transferred to another party. Relieves: (1) the Secretary from being required to inspect any public lands described in this Act or to inform Clear Creek County or any member of the public regarding the condition of such lands with respect to the presence or absence of hazardous substances or otherwise; and (2) the United States from liability regarding hazardous wastes or substances placed on such lands after their transfer to the ownership of another party."
