(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to establish a Maritime Security Fleet to enhance sealift capabilities and maintain a presence of U.S. documented vessels in international commercial shipping, consisting of privately owned, U.S. documented, active commercial vessels for which operating agreements are in effect. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) vessel eligibility; (2) operating agreements; (3) noncontiguous trade restrictions; (4) operating competing foreign vessels; and (5) funding. (Sec. 103) Continues specified contracts in effect under title VI of such Act (subsidy for the operation of vessels in foreign trade or off-season cruises), with exceptions. Limits the application of restrictions on operations under specified circumstances. (Sec. 104) Terminates restrictions applicable to a liner vessel constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned with the aid of a construction differential subsidy 25 years after the date of the original delivery of the vessel from the shipyard. (Sec. 106) Revises the definition of \"privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessel\" to mean a privately owned vessel that is documented under such Act and that: (l) was built in the United States; or (2) is built under a contract entered into after May 19, 1993, in a foreign shipyard that is not a foreign subsidized shipyard; or (3) does not transport on any voyage more than 12,000 tons of bulk cargo and meets other specified requirements. (Sec. 107) Repeals specified mortgagee, trustee, and mortgage restrictions. Permits a certificate of documentation for a vessel to be endorsed with a coastwise endorsement if specified conditions are met. (Sec. 108) Sets forth conditions under which a vessel may be placed under a foreign registry without the Secretary's approval. (Sec. 109) Authorizes the Secretary to pay assistance to the owner of a shipyard located in the United States for the construction of any commercial vessel that is one of a series of vessels. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) series transition payments and construction agreements; (2) applications for assistance; (3) restrictions on vessel operations; (4) vessel design awards; and (5) expansion of standing for maritime unions. (Sec. 113) Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the impact of this Act on the international competitiveness of U.S. documented vessels and specified related issues. (Sec. 114) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) cargo preference; (2) wages for which a preferred maritime lien may be established; and (3) compliance with the Buy American Act.
