    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the earned income credit. Allows a supplemental child credit for each qualifying child who has not attained age six. Limits such credit to four children. Establishes the earned income amount and the phaseout amount to be used in determining the earned income credit (currently tables determine such amounts based on the number of qualifying children). Repeals the use of such credit by individuals without children. Lowers the qualifying age requirement from under 19 years to under 18 years. Repeals the qualification of students under the age of 24. Requires the verification of taxpayer identification numbers on returns claiming the earned income credit."
