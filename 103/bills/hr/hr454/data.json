Confers continuing, exclusive jurisdiction upon the court of a State which has made such child support order and which is either the child's State or the State of one of the contestants. Authorizes a State court to modify a child support order made by the court of another State if: (1) it has jurisdiction to make such an order; and (2) the court of the other State no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction because it is no longer the child's State or the residence of any contestant or each contestant has filed written consent for the State to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of such order. Grants the court of a State which no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a child support order authority to enforce it with respect to non-modifiable obligations and unsatisfied obligations which accrued before the date on which a modification was made by another State in accordance with this Act."
