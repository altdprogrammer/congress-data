Requires the town of Pocahontas to submit an integrated management plan to the Secretary of the Interior for review and concurrence for the protection, enhancement, and interpretation of the cultural, natural, scenic, and recreational resources of the Area. Requires the Plan to specify a management entity for the Area. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with the entity to provide technical assistance for such protection, enhancement, and interpretation of the resources identified in the Plan. Ceases the establishment of the Area and the authorization of the Secretary under this Act if, within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, a Heritage Compact for the Area is not: (1) submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary; and (2) submitted to the Congress."
