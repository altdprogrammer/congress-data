Authorizes the Secretary to publish notice of such assessments in the Federal Register. Amends the International Banking Act of 1978, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the National Bank Act to direct the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency to take into account whether the Secretary has published such notice in the Federal Register when considering applications by foreign banks or other persons of a foreign country. Declares that no authority under this Act or any amendment it makes to any other law may be used to take any action with respect to a foreign country which is inconsistent with any bilateral or multilateral agreement that governs financial services in which such country is obligated to provide national treatment for U.S. banking organizations."
