Directs the Secretary to establish publicly accessible central depositories of such information. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to ensure that the termination practices used for agents who handle either private mortgage, property, or casualty insurance do not result in unfair discrimination against such agents because of either their geographic locations or that of their clients. Directs the Secretary to: (1) compile annually for each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) aggregate data by census tract regarding certain designated insurers; and (2) produce tables for each MSA indicating aggregate insurance underwriting patterns for various categories of census tracts grouped according to location, age of property, income level, and racial characteristics."
