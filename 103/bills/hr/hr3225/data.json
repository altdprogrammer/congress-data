    "text": "South African Democratic Transition Support Act of 1993 - Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to U.S. policy towards South Africa. Repeals specified provisions of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, providing for a total repeal of such Act when the President certifies to the Congress that an interim government that was elected on a nonracial basis through free and fair elections has taken office in South Africa. Urges all State or local governments and private entities in the United States to rescind any restrictions on economic interactions with South Africa. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should continue to respect United Nations Security Council resolutions on South Africa. Authorizes the President to provide development and economic support fund assistance to support the transition to nonracial democracy in South Africa. Prohibits such assistance to the Government of South Africa unless the President certifies to the Congress that an interim government elected on a nonracial basis through free and fair elections has taken office. Exempts from such prohibition assistance to the Transitional Executive Council, South African higher education institutions, and any other entity that would promote the transition to nonracial democracy. Makes organizations that have engaged in armed struggle or other acts of violence ineligible for such assistance unless they are committed to a suspension of violence in the context of progress toward nonracial democracy. Prohibits assistance to any organization that has espoused views inconsistent with democracy and free enterprise unless the organization is engaged in the process of transition to a nonracial democracy and such assistance would advance U.S. objectives of promoting democracy and free enterprise. Declares that the President should: (1) negotiate a tax treaty with South Africa; (2) initiate negotiations with the South African Government to provide for Overseas Private Investment Corporation programs in such country; (3) conclude cooperative agreements with South Africa on various issues; and (4) encourage other donors to expand their activities in support of the transition to nonracial democracy. States that: (1) the Director of the Trade and Development Agency should provide additional funds for projects in South Africa; (2) the Export-Import Bank should expand its activities in connection with exports to South Africa; and (3) the Director of the U.S. Information Agency should use his authorities to promote the transition to nonracial democracy. Requires the heads of Federal Government agencies, in procuring goods or services, to make affirmative efforts to assist business enterprises having more than 50 percent ownership by nonwhite South Africans. Declares that the Secretary of the Treasury should instruct the U.S. executive directors of international financial institutions to urge: (1) financial assistance to South Africa to support the transition to democracy; and (2) technical assistance to train South Africans in government management techniques."
