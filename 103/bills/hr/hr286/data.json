Requires that projects be designed to demonstrate a reduction in costs, an increase in access to care, and improvements in the quality of care. Allows grant funds to be used only to facilitate collaboration and not to purchase facilities or capital equipment. Requires at least three of the grants to be used to demonstrate how such agreements may be used to increase access to or quality of care in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations."
