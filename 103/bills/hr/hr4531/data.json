Prohibits persons employed by the armed forces outside the United States from being so tried if such persons are not nationals of the United States. Prohibits prosecution for such an offense in the United States if a foreign government has prosecuted such person for the conduct constituting such offense. Authorizes specified Federal officials to approve a prosecution which is otherwise prohibited under the grounds of prosecution by the foreign government in certain instances. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to designate a person to apprehend and detain outside the United States any person reasonably believed to have engaged in such an offense in the United States. Provides for release of such person to civilian law enforcement authorities of the United States for judicial proceedings. Authorizes a properly-designated member of the armed forces to deliver to the appropriate authorities of a foreign country an individual alleged to have engaged in such an offense if: (1) the appropriate authorities of such country request such delivery for trial; and (2) such delivery is authorized by a treaty or an agreement to which the United States is a party."
