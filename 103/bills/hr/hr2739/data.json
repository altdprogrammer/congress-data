(Sec. 102) Decreases the FY 1994 and FY 1995 authorization of appropriations for air navigation facilities. Authorizes appropriations for such facilities for FY 1996. Sets forth limits on appropriations for FY 1994 through 1996 for certain costs incurred for: (1) maintaining air navigation facilities; and (2) joint financing of air navigation services. (Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through FY 1996. (Sec. 104) Declares congressional policy that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system, including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of such facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability. (Sec. 105) Includes as an \"airport development\" activity the acquisition or installation at or by a public-use airport of explosive detection devices and universal access systems. (Sec. 106) Authorizes a State to submit to the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) an application for an airport development and planning project grant that benefits one or more (currently, at least two) State airports. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Secretary to approve the replacement or reconstruction of pavement at an airport only if the sponsor has provided assurances that such airport has implemented an airport pavement maintenance-management program. (Sec. 108) Repeals certain conditions relating to the approval of an aviation airport project application. (Sec. 109) Requires the Secretary prior to the approval of a project grant application for construction of a new hub airport that is expected to have 0.25 percent or more of the total annual enplanements in the United States to report to the Congress on its impact on: (1) fees incurred by air carriers for using the proposed airport; (2) air transportation that will be provided in the geographic region by it; and (3) the availability and cost of providing air transportation to rural areas in such region. (Sec. 110) Declares congressional policy that: (1) airport fees must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this Act; (2) airports should be self-sustaining; and (3) in establishing new fees and generating new revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not create revenue surpluses that exceed amounts to be used for the airport system. (Sec. 111) Authorizes the Secretary to approve a project grant application for an airport development project only if he or she receives, among other things, assurances that the airport owner or operator will submit to the Secretary and make available to the public an annual report listing: (1) amounts paid by the airport to any other government unit and the purposes for which such payment was made; and (2) services and property provided to such units and the amount of compensation received for them. Requires the Secretary to prescribe a uniform format for reporting that is designed to enable the public to understand how airport funds are collected and spent. Directs the Secretary to provide specified congressional committees annual summaries of the above-mentioned airport financial report. (Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary to establish procedures that will: (1) prohibit diversion of airport revenues; (2) take into account whether owners and operators have taken reasonable steps to make airports self-sustaining; and (3) mandate Department of Transportation (DOT) administrative safeguards to respond to complaints regarding possible specified violations. Requires the Secretary to withhold approval of any new grant applications for airport development projects or applications to impose a passenger facility fee if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds a violation of specified grant assurances regarding airport revenues. Provides for judicial enforcement. Sets forth both civil and administrative penalties. Requires the Secretary, when deciding whether or not to distribute certain discretionary funds to an airport, to consider as a factor militating against distribution the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local fuel aviation taxes for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airport system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport, and directly related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property. Prohibits States, because it unreasonably burdens and discriminates against interstate commerce, from levying a tax, fee, or charge exclusively upon a business located at a commercial service airport or operating as a permittee of such airport other than one that is wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes. (Sec. 113) Sets forth procedures for resolution of complaints of the reasonableness of fees imposed by owners or operators of airports on air carriers. (Sec. 114) Repeals a provision regarding the Federal share of costs for commercial airport development. (Sec. 115) Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts for airport development and planning projects pursuant to a letter of intent in the same fiscal year as the letter is issued. (Sec. 116) Extends the military airport set-aside program through FY 1996. Requires the Secretary to designate not more than 15 (currently, 12) current or former military airports to receive grants to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system. Authorizes the Secretary to designate such grants only if they would reduce delays at an airport with more than 20,000 hours of annual delays in commercial passenger aircraft takeoffs and landings. Eliminates the extension of any additional years after the five-year period that such airports are eligible to receive such funds. Authorizes a specified amount of discretionary airport development and planning funds for FY 1994 through 1996 for construction, improvement, or repair of airport surface parking lots, fuel farms, and utilities at such airports. (Sec. 117) Authorizes specified amounts made available to commercial service airports which annually have less than .05 percent of the total enplanements in the United States between January 1 and October 31, 1992, to be used to repay money borrowed to pay costs for airport terminal development provided such costs can be considered an allowable cost and were incurred after September 3, 1982. (Sec. 118) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to contract for the collection of airport safety data using sole source or limited source authority. (Sec. 119) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, in specified circumstances, to operators of airports and to units of local government for projects to soundproof residential buildings and to acquire residential properties at which noise levels are not compatible with normal operations of an airport. (Sec. 120) Directs the Secretary to purchase precision approach instrument landing system equipment for installation at airports. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1995 and 1996. (Sec. 121) Directs the Secretary to review the passenger facility charge program and take any corrective action necessary to address any problems with such program. Title II: Other Aviation Programs - Limits to five years the term of office of any individual appointed as FAA Administrator after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to provide safety-related training and operational services to foreign aviation authorities provided such services promote aviation safety. Requires the FAA Administrator to transmit to the Congress an annual list of foreign aviation authorities provided such services in the preceding fiscal year, including the dollar value and any reimbursement received for them. (Sec. 203) Includes as an \"eligible airport-related project\" with respect to the imposition of passenger facility fees the construction, reconstruction, repair, or improvement of an airport or actions to mitigate the environmental effects of such construction, reconstruction, repair, or improvement when they are necessary for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, or the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. (Sec. 204) Prohibits the imposition of a passenger facility fee on a passenger enplaning at an airport if such passenger did not pay for the air transportation which resulted in such enplanement, including in cases where the passenger obtained the ticket with a frequent flier award coupon without monetary payment. (Sec. 205) Prohibits an air carrier or foreign air carrier from installing, transporting, operating, or permitting the use of any gambling device on board an aircraft in foreign air transportation. Requires the Secretary to study the effects of gambling on commercial aircraft. (Sec. 206) Requires the Secretary, if basic essential air service is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Washington National Airport), to ensure that the air carrier providing such service has sufficient operational authority at the airport to provide such service. Sets forth specified exemptions for air carriers (including new entrant air carriers) and foreign air carriers providing air service to such airports (including Washington National Airport). Declares that if the Secretary finds that an exemption would significantly increase operational delays, he or she shall take action to ensure that air carriers providing basic essential air service are able to obtain access to a high density airport. States that the Secretary shall not be required to make slots available at O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois, if there are at least 132 slots available for basic essential air service to and from it. Prohibits the Secretary from taking a slot at a high density airport from a domestic air carrier and awarding it to a foreign air carrier if it is determined that domestic carriers are not provided equivalent rights of access to airports in the country of which the foreign carrier is a citizen. Requires the Secretary to complete the current examination of slot regulations and to report its results to specified congressional committees. Requires the Secretary to conduct a rulemaking proceeding based on the results of the examination. Prohibits the Secretary, in determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, from considering as a factor whether slots at high density airports are available for providing such service. (Sec. 207) Prohibits a carrier from terminating interstate air transportation from a nonhub airport unless it has given the Secretary at least 45 days' notice before such termination. Sets forth specified exceptions. Requires the Secretary to establish conditions under which regional/commuter carriers can be excluded from such notice requirements. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of such requirements. (Sec. 208) Limits State or local income tax liability for compensation paid by an air carrier to an employee on leave from regular duty in order to perform services on behalf of the employee's airline union. (Sec. 209) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to collect fees for providing as a service any test, authorization, certificate, permit, rating, evaluation, approval, inspection, or review outside of the United States. Requires the FAA Administrator to collect fees for certification and inspection of repair stations outside of the United States. Title III: Research, Engineering, and Development - Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization Act of 1994 - Authorizes FY 1995 and 1996 appropriations for specified areas of airway improvement research, engineering, and development.
