(Sec. 3) Requires the Director to report to the Congress on a quarterly basis regarding the need for any reprogramming or transfer of appropriated funds for Program activities in an amount greater than $5 million. Prohibits a Federal officer in the Office of National Drug Control Policy who is appointed by the President from participating in Federal election campaign activities, except that such an official is not thereby prohibited from making contributions to individual candidates. (Sec. 4) Revises provisions regarding the Strategy to: (1) include long-range goals for reducing the consequences of drug abuse; and (2) require the Director to include an evaluation of the effectiveness of Federal drug control during the preceding year. Specifies that such evaluation shall include an assessment of Federal drug control efforts, including: (1) an assessment of the reduction of drug use, drug availability, and associated consequences (such as the burdens drug users place on hospital emergency rooms); and (2) a determination of the status of U.S. drug treatment. Requires: (1) the Director to include with the Strategy specified information regarding assessment of drug use measurement, identification of factors restricting the availability of treatment, and proposed remedies to make such treatment available and to report to the President and the Congress on drug use and availability in the United States; and (2) Federal agencies responsible for the collection or estimation of drug-related information to cooperate with the Director to satisfy such requirements. (Sec. 5) Designates the Director as a member of the National Security Council. (Sec. 6) Requires: (1) the Director to identify and support, through interagency agreements or grants that are subjected to peer review by independent advisory boards, the application of technology to expanding the effectiveness or availability of drug treatment; and (2) the Director of the Advanced Research Project Agency to assist and support the Office and its Director. Repeals provisions of the Act pertaining to an executive reorganization study. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Director to pay the expenses for assemblage of individuals providing consultation in developing the Strategy. (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 9) Terminates the Office on September 30, 1994."
