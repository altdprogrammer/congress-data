    "text": "Children's Protection Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for imposition of the death penalty for causing the death of a kidnapping victim under age 18 intentionally, knowingly, through recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life, or by the intentional infliction of serious bodily injury. Lists mitigating factors (mental capacity, duress, minor participation in the offense, no significant criminal history, severe mental or emotional disturbance, and the victim's consent to the criminal conduct that resulted in the victim's death) and aggravating factors (involvement of a firearm or previous conviction of a violent felony involving a firearm, previous conviction of an offense for which a death sentence or life imprisonment was authorized, previous conviction of other serious offenses, grave risk of death to additional persons, heinous, cruel or depraved manner of commission, and procurement of the offense by payment) to be considered in determining whether a sentence of death is justified. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the conduct of a special hearing to determine whether such sentence is justified; (2) imposition, review, and implementation of a sentence of death; (3) use of State facilities; (4) appointment of counsel; and (5) collateral attack on a judgment imposing a death sentence. Prohibits: (1) the execution of a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed or of a pregnant woman; or (2) requiring an employee of any State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or the U.S. Marshals Service to be in attendance or to participate in any execution if it is contrary to the employee's moral or religious convictions."
