Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe regulations to govern fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone that are necessary to support the effective implementation of the interstate fishery management plan adopted for a fishery for which no Federal fishery management plan is in effect. Makes specified enforcement and penalty provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act apply with respect to the regulations. Directs the Commission to prepare and adopt fishery management plans or amendments to provide for the conservation and management of coastal fishery resources. Regulates: (1) plan and amendment contents; and (2) the time frame for State implementation and enforcement. Requires the Commission to: (1) establish standards and procedures for the preparation of interstate fishery management plans under this Act; and (2) annually monitor State implementation and enforcement. Establishes procedures with respect to State noncompliance with interstate fishery management plans. Provides for review by the Secretary of Commerce of Commission determinations of noncompliance. Requires the Secretary, upon determining that a State has failed to implement and enforce an interstate fishery management plan, to declare a moratorium on fishing for the species covered by the plan within the waters of that State. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) termination of any such moratorium upon notification by the Commission of its withdrawal of a determination of noncompliance by a State; and (2) prohibited acts during any such moratorium. Imposes civil and criminal penalties, including civil forfeiture of vessels and fish, for violations. Directs that any such moratorium be enforced by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Authorizes appropriations."
