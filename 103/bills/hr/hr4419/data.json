Amends SSA title IV part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) to require State AFDC plans to require the State agency to provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) with identifying information on any unlawful alien with any children who are U.S. citizens. Title II: Restrictions for Drug Addicts and Alcoholics - Amends SSA title XVI, among other things, to: (1) suspend SSI benefits for certain recipients who test positive for illegal drugs or alcohol until such time that the recipient tests negative; and (2) make various specified representative payee changes, including requiring SSI disability payments based on substance abuse to be paid through representative payees. Title III: Benefits for Children - Amends SSA title XVI to: (1) replace the current cash benefit with a medical voucher for children below 18 to use for items associated with treating child blindness or disability the costs of which are not covered under SSA title XIX (Medicaid); and (2) require disability reviews for SSI recipients upon reaching 18. Title IV: Fraud - Amends SSA title XVI to add additional requirements for: (1) foreign language translation under provisions for filing of applications and furnishing of information; (2) preventing fraud in the SSI program, for example, by establishing civil monetary penalties and assessments, and by making SSI fraud a felony; and (3) developing profiles of cases involving a high probability of fraud. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request INS and the Centers for Disease Control to provide any relevant medical information for determining alien eligibility for SSI. Directs the Secretary to report annually to appropriate congressional committees on reviews of SSI cases."
