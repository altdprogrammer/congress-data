    "text": "Copyright Reform Act of 1993 - Amends Federal copyright law to grant the Librarian of Congress (currently, the Register of Copyrights) the authority to enforce certain requirements concerning the deposit of copies or phonorecords for the Library of Congress. Directs the Librarian to: (1) publish an annual statement in the Federal Register of the categories of works of which the Library wishes to acquire copies or phonorecords; (2) maintain public records of the receipt of copies and phonorecords; and (3) establish a data base containing records of all deposits to be made available to the public. Revises provisions concerning voluntary copyright registrations to authorize the Register to specify classes of material in which registration may be made without deposit of a copy or phonorecord. Permits a single registration for a group of works by the same author first published as contributions to collective works (currently, periodicals) within a five-year (currently, 12-month) period under certain conditions. Requires the Register to hold annual public hearings to consider proposals to amend Copyright Office regulations and practices to eliminate deposits that are unnecessary and to simplify registration procedures. Establishes a short-form application for copyright registration of specified works. Requires the Register to establish a formal appeals procedure with respect to refusals to register claims to copyright. Repeals provisions that require copyright registration as a prerequisite to an infringement suit and to certain remedies for infringement. Authorizes the courts to eliminate the award of statutory damages for unknowing infringement of copyright (currently, the court may reduce such award to no less than $200). Directs the Librarian to study and report to the Congress on: (1) the mandatory deposit provisions of this Act, including alternatives to such requirements; and (2) the effect on Library acquisitions and the copyright registration system of changes made by this Act in the Federal copyright registration and deposit provisions."
