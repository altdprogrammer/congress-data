    "text": "Bureau of Prisons Community Services Projects Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Chief Executive Officer of a Federal penal or correctional facility, as part of an inmate work program, to provide products or services to private, nonprofit organizations or to a component of a State government or political subdivision thereof. Specifies that such: (1) products shall be of minimal cost and constructed in substantial part through the use of excess property and shall not be resold by the recipient; and (2) services shall be used only for the benefit of the recipient entity and not for the benefit of any other individual or organization and shall not displace or result in a reduction in hours, wages, or employment benefits of any employee of the recipient. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to specify that nothing in such Act shall impair or affect any authority of the Federal Bureau of Prisons or Federal Prison Industries with respect to the disposal of property used to produce such products. Makes this Act inapplicable to provisions of the Federal criminal code regarding transportation or importation of prison-made goods."
