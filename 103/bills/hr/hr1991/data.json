    "text": "United States-China Act of 1993 - Prohibits the President from recommending for a 12-month period in 1994 continuation of a waiver of human rights and emigration requirements for nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) for China under the Trade Act of 1974 unless the President reports to the Congress that China has: (1) taken steps to adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in China and Tibet and allowed the unrestricted emigration of Chinese citizens who desire to leave for reasons of political or religious persecution; (2) accounted for and released prisoners who dissented in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and other citizens detained for the nonviolent expression of their political beliefs or the exercise of internationally guaranteed rights of freedom of speech, association, and assembly; (3) not supported or administered any program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization; and (4) prevented the export to the United States of products manufactured by convict or forced labor. Requires such report to state whether China has made significant process in: (1) ceasing religious persecution in China and Tibet (including ceasing to threaten the survival of the Tibetan culture) and releasing religious leaders incarcerated as a result of the expression of their religious beliefs; (2) ceasing unfair trade practices which restrict American business; (3) providing U.S. exporters fair access to Chinese markets, including lowering tariffs, removing nontariff barriers, and increasing the purchase of U.S. goods and services; (4) adhering to the Missile Control Technology Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls, and the Australian Group on Chemical and Biological Arms controls; (5) adhering to the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong; (6) accounting for U.S. military personnel listed as prisoners of war or missing in action with respect to the Korean and Vietnam conflicts; (7) ceasing the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts; and (8) providing humanitarian groups access to prisoners and places of detention. Requires the President, if he recommends such extension, to report on the extent of China's compliance with the above-mentioned objectives. Grants nondiscriminatory treatment to products produced by nonstate-owned enterprises in China. Declares that despite China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), most-favored-nation treatment shall not automatically be conferred on Chinese products unless China satisfies the above-mentioned conditions. Requires the President, if he decides not to seek such extension, to ensure that members of the GATT take similar action with respect to China."
