    "text": "Public Safety and Licensing Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal criminal code to increase the fee for engaging in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or importing or manufacturing ammunition. Provides for the annual expiration of dealers' licenses. Prohibits dealing in firearms from a private residence, with exceptions. Repeals prohibitions against recording firearms records at, or transferring such records to, a public facility and establishing a system for registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms dispositions. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) establish recordkeeping requirements for dealers selling firearms from personal collections; and (2) revoke the license of any dealer who has violated (currently, willfully violated) specified provisions, rules, or regulations. Requires applicants seeking to engage in the business of dealing in firearms to have obtained a license, permit, or other document required under State or local law. Authorizes the Secretary to revoke a dealer's license for violation of any State or local firearms law. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring the secure storage of firearms by licensed dealers."
