Requires the Secretary to: (1) determine the pharmaceuticals that may be obtained by eligible persons; and (2) establish a fee or copayment to be paid for such pharmaceuticals. Bars such fees or copayments from exceeding those established under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 for participation in the pharmaceutical demonstration project or the retail pharmacy network included in a managed health care program."
