Requires the plan to provide for: (1) the maintenance of groundwater quality to protect human health, the environment, and groundwater resources; and (2) public hearings for receiving comments on the plan. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to declare that it is national policy that such a plan be promulgated before such facilities are constructed over a critical aquifer protection area."
