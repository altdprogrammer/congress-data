Permits sentence reductions of up to a year for a prisoner's successful completion of a residential substance abuse treatment program. Requires the Bureau to transmit to specified congressional committees annual reports describing each substance abuse treatment program operated by the Bureau, how program eligibility is determined, and Bureau compliance with the requirements of this Act.
