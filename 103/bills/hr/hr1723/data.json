    "text": "Central Intelligence Agency Voluntary Separation Pay Act - Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence, to avoid or minimize the need for involuntary separations due to downsizing, reorganization, or similar action, to establish a program under which employees may be offered separation pay to separate from service voluntarily, whether by retirement or resignation. Bars an employee who receives separation pay under such program from being reemployed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for 12 months. Prohibits an employee from being separated under such program unless the employee agrees not to represent any other person (except the United States) before the CIA, make any oral or written communication on behalf of any other person to influence the CIA, or participate in the award, modification, extension, or performance of any contract for property or services with the CIA for 12 months after separation. Sets penalties for violations. Authorizes separation pay only with the approval of the Director and only for employees who are within such occupational groups or geographic locations and who meet such other similar limitations as the Director may require. Provides that it shall be paid in a lump sum of not to exceed $25,000 and shall not be payable based on any separation occurring after September 30, 1997. Prohibits the Director from offering voluntary separation pay pursuant to this Act until 30 days after submitting to specified congressional committees a report describing occupational groups, geographic locations, or other conditions required by the Director. Requires the Director to submit annual reports for FY 1993 through 1997 on the effectiveness and costs of carrying out this Act. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act to authorize early retirement for employees meeting specified service requirements who are participants in the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System."
