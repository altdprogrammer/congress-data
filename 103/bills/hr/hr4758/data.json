    "text": "Durham Woods Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1994 - Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to instruct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring: (1) periodic inspections of natural gas pipeline facilities with the use of instrumented internal inspection devices at least once every seven years in high-density population areas; and (2) transmission pipeline operators to institute a monthly inspection program for hazards and line markers along pipeline rights-of-way. Declares it is a criminal offense to knowingly damage a natural gas pipeline facility and subsequently fail to report such damage. Increases the civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make grants to the States to promote public awareness programs regarding the dangers of excavating near natural gas pipelines; (2) study and report to the Congress on the safety of all natural gas transmission pipelines in the State of New Jersey and on an assessment of the risks to public safety and the environment posed by natural gas pipeline transportation; and (3) develop a comprehensive mapping program to identify the specific location of all transmission pipelines in the country."
