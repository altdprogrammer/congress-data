(Currently, such tax is three dollars per passenger.) Requires such covered voyages to have a port of call not located in the United States or its possessions. Imposes an excise tax on the loading of certain containers used to import or export commercial cargo on commercial vessels. Establishes the Maritime Revitalization Fund consisting of the maritime taxes imposed by this Act. Requires such Fund to support the maritime security fleet proposed by the Maritime Security and Competitiveness Act of 1993."
