Deems that certification to be a certification under specified provisions of the Fishermen's Protective Act, requiring the application of related provisions, including those prohibiting the importation of fish and wildlife products from the offending country. Mandates such a ban on fish and fish products. Authorizes additional economic sanctions if the fish and fish products ban is insufficient to stop such whaling."
