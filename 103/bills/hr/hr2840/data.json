Sets forth provisions concerning panel membership and arbitration proceedings. Requires the Librarian to: (1) adopt a panel decision unless the decision is arbitrary or contrary to the provisions of this Act; and (2) set a royalty fee or distribute fees if the decision is rejected. Provides for judicial review of Librarian decisions concerning panel determinations. Authorizes the Librarian and the Register of Copyrights to: (1) deduct administrative costs from collected royalty fees; or (2)assess costs directly to the parties to the most recent relevant arbitration proceeding if no royalty pool exists from which costs can be deducted. Provides that provisions of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1994 that require specified personnel reductions shall not apply to positions required for the administration of compulsory licensing by Library employees. Authorizes owners or users of copyrighted works to petition the Librarian for adjustments of royalty rates. Provides for interim royalty rates for certain musical works (that are subject to terminated license agreements) for performance by coin-operated phonorecord players. Repeals additional provisions concerning the Tribunal as well as provisions concerning compulsory licenses and limitations on exclusive rights for coin-operated phonorecord players. Revises requirements concerning compulsory licenses for public broadcasting. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit alien longshore workers to work in Alaska under specified circumstances."
