Creates a Federal civil rights claim against anyone who deprives an individual of such right, with compensatory and punitive damages, and injunctive or declaratory relief. Provides limitations, procedures, and rules of construction, including the limitation that random acts of violence, as opposed to bias-motivated acts, shall not be a basis for such a claim."
