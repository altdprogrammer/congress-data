Deems a plan to meet such standards if it provides for: (1) stop-loss protection for catastrophic expenses; (2) coverage of facility-based care and specified outpatient medical management; (3) coverage of visits for psychological, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services, with coinsurance and fees to ensure effective cost control; and (4) coverage of prescription drugs and medically necessary services for comorbidity of other disorders. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on the failure of a heath insurance carrier or an employer health benefit plan to comply with standards under this Act."
