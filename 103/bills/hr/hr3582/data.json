    "text": "Amends the National School Lunch Act (NSLA) to make Head Start participants automatically eligible for free meals under the NSLA school lunch program and the school breakfast program of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA). Revises the child and adult care food program under NSLA. Broadens the definition of eligible institution. Provides for additional reimbursement for family or group day care home sponsoring organizations and an enhanced administrative reimbursement rate for such organizations serving rural or low-income area providers. Increases the allowable amount of startup and expansion funds. Allows expansion funds to be used for outreach to unlicensed day care homes. Extends the authorization of appropriations for such program. Adds provisions relating to information about Medicaid and the special nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC). Expands eligibility for meal supplements for the afterschool care program to youths up to age 18. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report on demonstration projects to improve food service for homeless children. Directs the Secretary to use certain funds for nutrition counseling, assessments, and referrals for participants in such homeless demonstration program, WIC, Medicaid, and similar programs for homeless pregnant women or those at risk of becoming so, homeless mothers with newborn infants, or the guardians of boarder babies or other abandoned infants. Requires periodic reports. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA) to require States to use a portion of certain increased grant funds for nutrition education and training assistance for family day care home sponsors and day care center staff."
