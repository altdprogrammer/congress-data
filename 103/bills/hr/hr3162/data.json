    "text": "Asylum at Ports of Entry System Improvements Act of 1993 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to create grounds for exclusion of an alien who: (1) uses or attempts to use a fraudulent document to enter the United States or to board a common carrier for such purpose; or (2) uses a document to board a common carrier and then fails to present such document to an immigration official upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. Directs the Attorney General to designate a class of senior asylum officers who shall perform specified expedited asylum examinations at U.S. airports or other ports of entry. Authorizes such officers, upon a finding of frivolous claim or resettlement in another country, to exclude the alien from the United States. Sets forth limited petition and review provisions. Increases penalties for certain alien smuggling offenses. Creates a separate offense and penalty for an alien smuggler who seriously injures or jeopardizes an alien's life."
