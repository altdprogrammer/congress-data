Establishes in the Treasury the Radiation Experimentation Compensation Trust Fund for compensating the subjects of experiments conducted between January 1, 1940, and December 31, 1974, during which the subjects were intentionally exposed to radiation without their informed consent. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Attorney General to establish procedures for the submission of claims and pay from amounts in the Fund each claim meeting the requirements of this Act. Provides for payments in cases of deceased experimental subjects. States that payments under this Act which are accepted by a subject or the subject's survivors shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of or on behalf of the subject against the United States arising out of the subject's participation in the experiment. Provides for judicial review. Establishes a time limit for filing claims of 20 years after enactment of this Act."
