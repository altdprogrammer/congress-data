Prohibits the Secretary from approving a project demolition application. Requires public housing agencies to carry out job training and employment programs in connection with certain housing construction and revitalization projects. Reduces lower income rent contribution amounts under the National Housing Act, the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Housing Act of 1949, the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, and the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983.
