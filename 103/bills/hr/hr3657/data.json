Requires the Forest Service and Bureau to annually review and adjust such charges to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, with limitations. Requires any site user to pay an additional amount for granting access to the site to additional users and to provide a certified list of such additional users. Directs the Secretaries to jointly establish a broad-based advisory group of representatives from the nonbroadcast communications industry and the two agencies to review and report to specified congressional committees on recommendations on acceptable criteria for determining fair market values for communications site use and next best alternative use."
