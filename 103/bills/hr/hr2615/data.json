Specifies that the disposition of the surface estate in land by the United States qualifies for the purpose of such provision if: (1) the value of such estate is approximately equal to the value of the interest in the land to be acquired, as determined by the Secretary of the department concerned; and (2) such Secretary certifies that the United States has disposed of land for the purpose of this section. Subjects acquisition of land within a State to this Act if 25 percent or more of the land within the State is federally-owned. Excludes specified lands and properties from this Act. Authorizes the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States to waive such land acquisition requirements during a declaration of war or national emergency."
