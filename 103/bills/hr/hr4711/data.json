Includes unsecured claims for alimony, maintenance, or support among priority claims and expenses (thus lifting them from their current status of general, unsecured debts). Prohibits a debtor from avoiding a judicial lien that secures a debt for alimony, maintenance, or support. States that a bankrupt debtor is not discharged from any debt incurred in connection with a divorce or separation agreement. Prohibits a bankruptcy trustee from avoiding a transfer that is a bona fide debt for alimony, maintenance, or support. Permits a child support creditor to appear before the court in any Federal bankruptcy proceeding without charge and without meeting local requirements for attorney appearances if the creditor or representative files a detailed child support debt statement. Title II: Bankruptcy Review Commission - National Bankruptcy Review Commission Act - Establishes the National Bankruptcy Review Commission to study and report to the Congress, the Chief Justice, and the President on bankruptcy issues and the impact of the bankruptcy laws upon women and children living in poverty after divorce. Authorizes appropriations."
