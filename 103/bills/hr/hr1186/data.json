    "text": "National Environmental Technologies Agency Act - Establishes the National Environmental Technologies Agency to: (1) coordinate Federal environmental restoration and protection planning; (2) identify areas that need technical solutions to maintain environmental security, are not receiving product-oriented research necessary to meet those needs, and exhibit the greatest promise for the development of solutions; (3) support the development of technology having future application in environmental restoration and protection; (4) coordinate the exchange of technological information relating to environmental restoration and protection between Federal agencies and the private sector; (5) support continuing research and development of advanced technologies; (6) monitor research and development being conducted on advanced technologies by private industry; and (7) promote continuing development of a technological industrial base in the United States. Establishes the Industry and Academia Advisory Council to make recommendations regarding general policy for the Agency. Permits the Agency Administrator to transfer to the domestic private sector technology developed with the support of the Agency if the technology may have potential application in private activities relating to environmental restoration and protection. Provides for dissemination of the results of Agency research. Directs the Administrator, in determining whether to make an award to a joint venture, to consider whether the joint venture has provided for appropriate participation of U.S. small businesses. Entitles the United States to a share of licensing fees and royalty payments made to a joint venture in an amount proportionate to the Federal share of costs incurred. Provides for the return of unspent Federal funds to the Agency if it appears that the recipient is not making satisfactory progress toward successful completion of the project. Entitles the United States, upon dissolution of a joint venture that receives funding under this Act, to a share of the residual assets proportionate to the Federal share of costs. Establishes the Environmental Advanced Research Projects Revolving Fund. Authorizes the use of the Fund to provide financial assistance to entities that serve long-term environmental security needs. Authorizes appropriations."
