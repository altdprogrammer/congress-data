Specifies that a patent issued on such a process shall: (1) contain the claims to the composition of matter used in or made by that process; or (2) if such composition of matter is claimed in another patent, be set to expire on the same date as such other patent. Provides that, if a claim to a composition of matter is held invalid and that claim was the basis of a determination of nonobviousness under this title, the process shall no longer be considered nonobvious solely on the basis of provisions of this title. Confers jurisdiction upon the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to hear, determine, and render conclusions sufficient to inform the Congress of the amount, if any, legally or equitably due upon the claims of Inslaw, Inc., and William and Nancy Hamilton against the United States, arising out of the furnishing of computer software and services to the U.S. Department of Justice. Sets guidelines for the submission of a report to the Congress on that subject. Waives sovereign immunity for purposes of such report."
