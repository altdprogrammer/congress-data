Prescribes investment limits, and reduces from five percent to three percent the percentage of total assets that may be so invested. Requires a depository institution service corporation to obtain prior written approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency before paying management fees to an institution-affiliated party (or to any corporation owned by such party). Prohibits a depository institution service corporation from performing activities or services that are not permissible for a national bank."
