Requires all fees so collected to be used solely to reduce the subsidy on such guaranteed loans. Applies such fees to loans sold into secondary markets after August 31, 1993. Authorizes the SBA to temporarily reduce the guarantee percentage of loans exceeding $155,000 and having a maturity period of more than ten years. Directs the SBA to study, monitor, and evaluate the impact of amendments made by this Act on the ability of small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by minorities and women, to obtain financing and on the effectiveness, viability, and growth of the secondary loan market authorized under the Small Business Act. Requires a report. Repeals provisions of this Act concerning reduced loan guarantees on September 30, 1996."
