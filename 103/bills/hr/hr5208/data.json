Authorizes Amtrak to require an employee whose position is eliminated by such a discontinuance to transfer to any vacant position for which the employee can be made qualified on any part of Amtrak's system. Allows the employee, if such transfer requires a change in residence or seniority district, to choose: (1) a transfer to the position and coverage by the collective bargaining agreement of the seniority district to which the employee is transferred; or (2) a voluntary furlough at the employee's home location and receipt of protective benefits as limited by this Act."
