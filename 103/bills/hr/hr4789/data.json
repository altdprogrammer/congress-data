Directs: (1) the council to convene a National Consensus Conference on Parkinson's Disease and Related Neuro-degenerative Disorders to aid in the development of a broad-based strategy for identifying the cause of and treating such disorders; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and annually submit to specified congressional committees a coordinated research agenda and to provide for the establishment of ten Parkinson's Research Centers. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) award feasibility study grants to support the development of preliminary data sufficient to provide the basis for the submission of applications for independent research support grants or establishment of a Center; and (2) award grants to appropriate institutions for the provision of training and continuing education concerning health and long-term care of individuals with Parkinson's. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a grant program to support scientists who have distinguished themselves in the field of Parkinson's research; (2) a registry for screening and collecting patient and family data that may be useful in determining incidence and possible risk factors concerning Parkinson's; and (3) a national education program designed to foster a national focus on Parkinson's and the care of those with Parkinson's. Sets forth application requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
