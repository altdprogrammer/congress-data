(Sec. 4) Delineates circumstances in which a person's contribution shall be considered as being made through an intermediary or a conduit (and therefore treated as contributions from such person). (Sec. 5) Treats contributions by dependents not of voting age as contributions of the person or persons upon whom they are dependent. (Sec. 6) Aggregates, for contribution limit purposes, contributions from State and local party committees with all contributions from such political party. (Sec. 7) Makes it unlawful to secure or to use contributions secured by physical force or other intimidation. (Sec. 8) Prohibits a candidate from accepting cash contributions aggregating more than $100 from any one person. (Sec. 9) Defines \"generic campaign activity\" and \"State Party Grassroots Fund.\" (Sec. 10) Establishes individual and PAC contribution limits to State Party Grassroots Funds and other State party committees. Allows individuals to contribute up to a specified amount of funds annually to State party committees in addition to current amounts contributed annually to all candidates and their authorized committees. Replaces the current individual contribution limits for any calendar year with aggregate contribution limits for an election cycle. Revises presidential campaign expenditure limits. (Sec. 11) Prohibits, with exceptions, a national committee and a congressional campaign committee from soliciting or accepting contributions not subject to certain limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements. Subjects to such requirements any amount (\"soft money\") solicited, received, or expended by a national, State, district, or local committee of a political party with respect to certain activities such as voter registration or get-out-the vote efforts. (Sec. 12) Sets forth fundraising limitations for Federal candidates and office holders and certain political committees. (Sec. 13 and 14) Sets forth reporting requirements for: (1) political committees; (2) exempt contributions; (3) State committees; and (4) certain independent expenditures. (Sec. 15) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a licensee to provide equal broadcast time to qualified candidates for public office. (Sec. 16) Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit Federal candidates from establishing leadership committees. Restricts contributions between principal campaign committees. (Sec. 17) Prohibits fund transfers among noncandidate, nonparty political committees. (Sec. 18) Restricts certain connected political action committee activities."
