    "text": "Requires a State that received funds from the Office of Justice Programs pursuant to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to submit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation juvenile delinquency proceeding, photographic, and fingerprint records of a juvenile found guilty of committing an act which if committed by an adult would be an offense of murder, attempted murder, or rape. Permits such records to be used by a State only for criminal justice purposes for use in the manner applicable to adult defendants, including: (1) notification of a licensed firearm dealer about whether the individual is or is not prohibited from receiving a firearm under State or Federal law; and (2) a criminal history background check under the National Child Protection Act of 1993. Authorizes the Attorney General to prescribe other measures as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Act, including measures relating to the security, confidentiality, accuracy, use, misuse, and dissemination of information and to audits and recordkeeping."
