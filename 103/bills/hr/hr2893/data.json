Requires such rules to require that claims in advertising for food characterizing the level of any nutrient in food or the relationship of any such nutrient to a disease be consistent with specified provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act concerning misbranded food. Authorizes a State to bring a civil action when it believes that such rules have been violated."
