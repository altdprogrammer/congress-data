    "text": "Hazardous Materials Transportation Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to prohibit a person from representing that a component of a container or package for the transportation of hazardous materials is safe, certified, or in compliance with the requirements of this Act unless it meets such requirements. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to waive mandatory registration statement filing requirements and the payment of certain fees for any person not domiciled in the United States who solely offers from a place outside of the United States the transportation of hazardous materials to the United States if the country in which such person is domiciled does not require U.S. domiciliaries to file such statements or to pay such fees when making such offer. (Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations for the regulation of the transportation of hazardous materials. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary, in order to further the training of public sector employees to respond to hazardous materials accidents, to make grants to national nonprofit employee organizations engaged solely in fighting fires for the purpose of training individuals with statutory responsibility to respond to such accidents. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to one or more persons, including a State or local government or department, agency or instrumentality, to carry out a pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a reporting system and computerized telecommunication data center that is capable of: (1) receiving and retrieving data on shipments of hazardous materials; (2) identifying types of hazardous material being shipped; and (3) providing information to facilitate responses to accidents involving such shipments. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the safety considerations of transporting hazardous materials in close proximity to Federal prisons, particularly those housing maximum security prisoners. (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to enter into arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to study and report to the Secretary and the Congress on both commercial motor vehicles carrying hazardous materials and commercial vehicles in general with respect to: (1) the regulation of radar detectors in such vehicles; (2) ways in which radio microwave technologies may be used to enhance the safety of such vehicles; and (3) ways in which such technologies may be used in the the application of intelligent vehicle highway systems consistent with the goals of the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems Act of 1991. (Sec. 14) Requires the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether certain requirements under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act with respect to openhead fiber drum packaging can be met for the domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials with standards other than certain performance oriented packaging standards contained in 49 Code of Federal Regulations 178. Requires the Secretary to implement any other performance oriented packaging standard that will provide an equal or greater level of safety for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials."
