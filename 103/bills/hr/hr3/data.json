Waives such limits for a candidate whose opponent is not participating in such spending limitations and receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of 25 percent of election cycle limits. Exempts from such limits legal, tax, accounting, and fund raising costs. Sets forth graduated civil penalties for different levels of excess expenditures. Limits a candidate's personal campaign contributions in an election cycle to $50,000. Waives such limits in the case of a nonparticipating opponent who exceeds such limits.

Defines \"express advocacy\" as any communication that when taken as a whole: (1) expresses support for or opposition to a specific candidate, a specific group of candidates, or candidates of a particular political party; or (2) suggests taking action with respect to an election, such as voting for or against, contributing to, or participating in campaign activity. (Sec. 302) Sets forth reporting requirements for certain independent expenditures.

Title IV: Contributions and Expenditures By Political Party Committees - Amends FECA to define: \"generic campaign activity\" as a campaign activity on behalf of a party rather than a candidate; and (2) \"State Party Grass Roots Fund\" as a segregated State fund on behalf of a Federal candidate. (Sec. 402) Permits maximum contributions to a State Party Grassroots Fund of: (1) $20,000 by an individual; and (2) $15,000 from a multicandidate committee.

(Sec. 508) Prohibits specified election-related activities by foreign nations. Title VI: Reporting Requirements - Amends FECA to require all Federal candidates and authorized committees to aggregate information on their financial activity reports on an election cycle basis (instead of a calendar year basis, as at present). (Sec. 602) Requires candidates to report any expenditure in excess of the reporting threshold made to a person who provides services or materials for the candidate, whether the payment was made directly or indirectly under subcontract to another person providing personal or consulting services.

(Sec. 604) Requires the Commission to maintain computerized indices of all contributions of at least $200.

(Sec. 802) Excludes ballot initiative contributions and expenditures from the usual meaning of contributions and expenditures under FECA. (Sec. 804) Makes the political committee organizational and reporting requirements (and attendant civil penalties) under FECA applicable to ballot initiative committees. Title IX: Miscellaneous - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a broadcast station to make broadcast time available to candidates in the last 30 (currently 45) days before a primary and the last 45 (currently 60) days before a general election, at the lowest unit charge of the station for the same amount of time (currently, the same class and amount of time) for the same period on the same date. Prohibits broadcasters from preempting advertisements sold to political candidates at the lowest unit rate, unless the preemption is beyond the broadcaster's control. (Sec. 903) Directs the Commission to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of developing telephonic voting for persons with disabilities.
