    "text": "National Youth Apprenticeship Opportunity Act of 1993 - Establishes a national system of support for State youth apprenticeship programs that: (1) integrate academic and work-based learning; (2) provide for work-site learning and paid work experience; (3) are offered to students (16 years old or older) beginning in the 11th grade; and (4) are intended to result in receipt of a high school diploma and an approved certificate of competency, and, as appropriate, entry into a postsecondary program, a program registered under the National Apprenticeship Act, or permanent employment. Requires State boards of vocational education that receive funds under this Act to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for such programs. Sets forth program responsibilities of LEA grantees. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to: (1) make such program grants to States; (2) establish, in the Department of Education, an Information Clearinghouse on Youth Apprenticeships; and (3) identify at least three successful youth apprenticeship programs to serve as models. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) provide technical assistance to the Secretary upon request; and (2) study and report to specified congressional committees on the feasibility of establishing national occupational standards to measure achievement and skills mastery demonstrated by students who complete youth apprenticeships. Authorizes appropriations."
