Requires such personnel to be managed during such period on the basis of the needs of eligible veterans and the availability of funds. Provides that, during such period, whenever an activity at a Department health-care facility is converted from performance by Federal employees to performance by contracted employees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall: (1) require the contractor to give an employee preference to former Department employees displaced by the award of such contract; and (2) provide to such former employees all possible assistance in obtaining other Federal employment or entrance into job training and retraining programs. Requires information concerning the use of such contracting-out authority to be included in the Secretary's annual budget and activities report to the Congress."
