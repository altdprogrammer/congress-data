Terminates the FCC's authority to provide preferential treatment in licensing procedures (by precluding the filing of mutually exclusive applications) to such persons on September 30, 1998. Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations specifying the procedures and criteria by which the FCC will evaluate applications for preferential treatment in licensing processes for such persons."
