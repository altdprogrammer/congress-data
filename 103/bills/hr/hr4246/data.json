Amends the Panama Canal Act of 1979 to permit the use of Commission funds to defray the cost of education services provided by schools in the United States to: (1) Commission employees who are U.S. citizens; and (2) persons who were receiving such services at the expense of the Canal Zone Government. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the definition of \"special immigrant\" to include Panamanian immigrants who, as of the date the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 entered into force, have been employed by the U.S. Government in the Canal Zone with a total of 15 years of service or more and continue to be so employed. (Current law confers such status only on those individuals who are honorably retired.)"
