Requires the States of New York and Connecticut, in order to be eligible for grants, to designate bays and harbors of the Sound at which eligible activities will be carried out. Requires grants to be used to: (1) carry out eligible activities and monitoring programs at designated bays and harbors; and (2) educate the public on the implementation and results of such activities.
