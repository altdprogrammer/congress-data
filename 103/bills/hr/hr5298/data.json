Declares that such prohibition shall cease to apply to such a country if it certifies to the President that it will not import Cuban sugar, syrups, or molasses until free and fair elections are held in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of internationally recognized observers. Authorizes the President to reallocate to other countries the quota of sugars, syrups, and molasses allocated to such a country during the period in which a prohibition is in effect."
