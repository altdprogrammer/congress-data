Amends the Endangered American Wilderness Act of 1978 to revise the boundary of the Gospel-Hump Planning Unit. Title II: Idaho Forest Management - Designates specified lands in the same Idaho national forests as management areas, wildlife corridors, a historic area, and a recreation area. Outlines management directives and emphasis for such lands. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a project on St. Joe National Forest to demonstrate the change in timber volume resulting from investing in good sites on lands already roaded. Leaves the Jackson Bar Airstrip (known as the Wilson Bar Airstrip) open for use by recreation aviators. Directs the Secretary to modify the existing land and resource management plans for the national forests affected by this Act. Sets forth provisions concerning water quality on the Panhandle National Forest and monitoring of the areas and corridors designated by this Act. Title III: Release to Multiple Use - Releases those National Forest System lands in Idaho which were not designated as wilderness, management areas, wildlife corridors, or a historic or recreation area from certain management provisions relating to wilderness study areas to allow them to be managed for multiple use and not necessarily for the purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness designation. Title IV: Idaho Rural Economic Development - Requires the Secretary to promote ecosystem restoration, rehabilitation programs, and projects through technical assistance, grants, and cooperative agreements with Idaho agencies, local governments, private corporations, and landowners. Authorizes appropriations."
