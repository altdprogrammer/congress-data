    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to provide that if a State Governor submits a redesignation of an area from nonattainment to attainment and such designation is based upon attainment of the relevant national ambient air quality standard for three consecutive years, such redesignation shall become effective immediately upon receipt by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Requires the Office of Technology Assessment to study methods for implementing enhanced inspection and maintenance programs. Includes within such study an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of such methods. Directs the Administrator to republish the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance guidance document and incorporate the study's findings. Grants States one year from the study's publication date to submit or revise implementation plans with respect to the enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program."
