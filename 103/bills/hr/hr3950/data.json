Requires the assisted local entities to institute a collaborative structure that trains and coordinates efforts of teachers, administrators, social workers, guidance counselors, parents, and school volunteers to provide concurrent social services for at-risk students at selected public schools in eligible communities. Allows such entities to develop various programs to serve the comprehensive needs of students, including: (1) homework assistance and afterschool educational, social, and athletic activities; (2) nutrition services; (3) mentoring; (4) family counseling; and (5) parental training. Directs the Secretary to establish a peer review panel to recommend an illustrative model and an evaluation design for such programs. Authorizes appropriations for this Act out of specified amounts from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund."
