    "text": "Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Amendments of 1993 - Amends the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988 (the Act) to reauthorize and revise the Act and its program of grants to States. Requires: (1) increasing involvement of individuals with disabilities (and their families and representatives) in planning, developing, implementing, and assessing technology-related programs, and in decisions related to provision of assistive technology devices and services; (2) providing other assistance to ensure continuance of the comprehensive, consumer-responsive statewide system after Federal support has ended; and (3) promoting systems change to facilitate access to, provision of, and funding for technology-related assistance to individuals with disabilities. Adds mandated activities involving such systems change, including review and possible modification of State laws, coordination among State agencies, and information dissemination and training. Adds authorized activities, including outreach to underserved groups, alternative State-financed systems, support for expenses, equipment demonstration, partnerships, case management, assistance in meeting related requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and recycling activities. Revises application requirements with respect to: (1) designation of responsible entity; (2) agency involvement and coordination; (3) consumer involvement; (4) planning for systems change; (5) assessment; (6) underserved groups; (7) training; (8) consumer assistance, protection, and advocacy; and (9) indirect costs. Allows award of an additional extension grant to any State demonstrating significant progress in meeting the goals of the initial extension grant as well as need for additional support to complete systems change and achieve the Act's purposes. Adds provisions for: (1) timetables for systems change plans; (2) protection and advocacy services; (3) assistance under other laws; (4) evaluation and data collection; and (5) technical assistance and information. Authorizes appropriations."
