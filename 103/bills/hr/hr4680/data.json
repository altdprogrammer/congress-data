    "text": "Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 1994 - Amends Federal law to make it a prohibited personnel practice for any Federal agency official to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of any disclosure of information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member, which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences: (1) a violation of law or regulation; or (2) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to prohibit any Office of Inspector General from disclosing a whistleblower's identity, except in accordance with a request of the Attorney General for the purpose of a criminal investigation. Provides for disciplinary action for violations of this prohibition. Requires every Federal agency Inspector General: (1) to ensure, at the time of receiving any complaint or information from an employee, that the employee is fully aware of specified rights and remedies; and (2) to disclose to an employee, within a reasonable time, any information that might be evidence of a retaliatory action or of an intent to take such an action."
