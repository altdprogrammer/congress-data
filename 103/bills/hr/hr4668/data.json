    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1994-06-28", 
    "text": "Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1994 - Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue a certificate attesting to the adequacy of garbage reception facilities at a port or terminal only if an onsite inspection has been conducted prior to the issuance of a certificate. Makes such certificates valid for a period of five years unless there is a change of operator. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require the operators of ports or terminals subject to MARPOL Protocol (the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973) requirements relating to reception facilities to post placards stating that users should report facility inadequacies to the Secretary. Requires all vessels to display placards and conduct briefings that notify the crew and passengers of requirements of Annex V of the Convention. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse or revoke certain permits to proceed or depart of foreign vessels in violation of MARPOL requirements. Provides for a toll-free telephone number for reporting MARPOL violations. Amends the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 to express the sense of the Congress that certain shipper insurance policies should not provide for the payment of penalties under the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Requires persons in charge of vessels to include information on the disposal of onboard waste in the notice of arrival to the port. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a Marine Debris Coordinating Committee. Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to extend authorized appropriations for regional marine research programs from FY 1996 through FY 2000."
