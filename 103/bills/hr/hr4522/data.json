Revises the schedule of application fees for personal communications services and amateur vanity call signs under the Act. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) use of such moneys; (2) recovery of executive and legal costs incurred by the FCC; (3) establishment and adjustment of fees; (4) regulatory fees for satellite television operations; and (5) governmental entities use for common carrier purposes. Directs the FCC to: (1) develop accounting systems for the purposes of making adjustments authorized by this Act; and (2) annually prepare and submit to the Congress an analysis of such systems and afford interested persons the opportunity to submit comments concerning the allocation of costs. Authorizes the FCC to: (1) designate an entity to make inspections of ship radio stations; and (2) narrow the circumstances under which the required annual inspection may be waived in the public interest. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) expedited Instructional Television Fixed Service processing; (2) tariff rejection authority; (3) refund authority; (4) licensing of aviation, maritime, and personal radio services by rule; (5) forfeitures for violations imperiling safety of life; (6) use of experts and consultants; and (7) the statute of limitations for forfeiture proceedings against common carriers.
