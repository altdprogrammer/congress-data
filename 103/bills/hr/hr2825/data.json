Establishes the Job Training Council, composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor, and the Director of the Office of Management and the Budget as Chairperson. Authorizes the Council to make matching grants to: (1) nonprofit organizations for retraining dislocated workers; and (2) nonprofit educational telecommunications organizations for developing, producing, and distributing instructional telecommunications materials and services for local vocational and technical educational schools and colleges. Sets forth priorities for persons to be served and for areas of high labor unemployment rates. Authorizes the Council to waive for a nonprofit organization inconsistent requirements of different Federal job training assistance programs for adults and out-of-school youth under specified conditions, including local government certification. Directs the Council to disseminate information on successful retraining models developed by any grant recipient under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
