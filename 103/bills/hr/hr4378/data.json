States that the portion of such amount not attributable to wages and wage-related rural hospital costs shall be equal to such portions of such amount for hospitals in another urban area. Requires the Secretary to adjust the proportion of hospitals' costs taking into account only costs attributable to wages and salaries, employee benefits, and professional fees. (This eliminates payment differentials between urban and rural hospitals.) Expresses the sense of the Congress that payment reductions made to providers under Medicare should be adjusted to reduce their disproportionate impact upon providers in rural areas. Subtitle B: Other Programs - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 to extend through FY 1997 the authorization of appropriations for rural health transition grants. Title II: Programs of Public Health Service - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary to make grants to public and private entities for demonstration projects for: (1) telecommunications which make medical advice and technologies available to rural area health professionals; and (2) increased access of rural populations to primary health services. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Antitrust Provisions - Provides antitrust exemption guidelines for certain rural hospitals. Title IV: Commission on Reducing the Burden of Regulations and Paperwork on Small Rural Hospitals - Establishes the Advisory Commission on Reducing the Burden of Regulations and Paperwork on Small Rural Hospitals to analyze and report to the Secretary and the Congress on the impact on such hospitals of governmental regulations and paperwork."
