    "text": "Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to include among its purposes the advocacy of fishery habitat protection. (Sec. 4) Revises the guidelines governing permits for foreign fishing vessels. (Sec. 5) Repeals the large-scale driftnet fishing reporting requirements. (Sec. 6) Modifies the national standards for fishery conservation and management to include the mandate that conservation and management measures minimize the incidental catch of non-target living marine resources. (Sec. 7) Expands the number of voting members on the Pacific Fishery Management Council to include one appointed from an Indian tribe with federally recognized fishing rights from a member State. Prescribes selection guidelines for such Indian representative. Requires each Regional Fishery Management Council to: (1) submit to the Secretary of Commerce proposed regulations and/or a fishery management plan for the prevention of overfishing of stock; and (2) submit annually for publication by the Secretary a listing of all essential fish habitats for all fishery management plans in effect on that date. Expands the guidelines governing disclosure of the financial interests of Council members. (Sec. 8) Modifies the guidelines governing: (1) the contents of fishery management plans and regulations; (2) pre-rulemaking procedures; and (3) rulemaking procedures. (Sec. 11) Expands the conditions under which a foreign fishing vessel may engage in fish processing within the internal waters of a State to mandate the submission by the vessel operator of specified fish tonnage reports. (Sec. 12) Modifies the guidelines governing: (1) proscriptions under this Act; (2) civil penalty review and permit sanctions; and (3) enforcement actions. (Sec. 15) Declares that claims for observers' wages shall be considered maritime liens against the vessel and be accorded the same priority as seamen's liens under admiralty and general maritime law. (Sec. 17) Authorizes appropriations."
