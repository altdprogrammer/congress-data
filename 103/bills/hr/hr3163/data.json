    "text": "Debt Collection Act Amendments of 1993 - Amends Federal law to require the head of an executive or legislative agency (who, currently, is merely authorized) to: (1) contract with a collection service to recover indebtedness owed to the United States; (2) collect such indebtedness from Federal employees in installment deductions; (3) disclose certain information to a consumer reporting agency when trying to collect a claim; and (4) collect such a claim by administrative offset. Requires the head of a Federal agency to report promptly to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) any debt that has been paid in full. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the IRS to disclose address information in accordance with any law granting a Federal claim against a taxpayer. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress after annual audits of each Federal agency on: (1) the amount of debt owed to the agency; (2) the amount that is delinquent; and (3) action taken by the agency to recover such debt. Repeals the termination date of the pilot debt collection project of the Department of Justice. Requires the Attorney General to include in the annual report to the Congress on activities to recover indebtedness the total cost of the pilot project and the total amount of debt recovered under it. Requires that recovered funds be used to reduce the Federal deficit. Requires a percentage of recovered funds to be used by the agency in collecting indebtedness. Prohibits the head of a Federal agency from making a loan until the loan applicant has been prescreened to determine creditworthiness. Requires the IRS to disclose address information to a Federal agency for use in collecting a claim. Prohibits the head of a Federal agency from making a loan to a loan applicant who owes a delinquent debt to the Federal Government, including the IRS. Allows the use of administrative charges by the Secretary of the Treasury for improving credit management techniques."
