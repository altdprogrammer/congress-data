    "text": "Veterans Health-Care Reform Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide medical care as needed for any disability of a veteran who meets any of the following conditions: (1) the veteran has a service-connected disability; (2) the annual attributable income of the veteran does not exceed a specified amount; (3) the discharge or release from duty was for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; or (4) the veteran is in receipt of, or would be entitled to, disability compensation. Outlines provisions concerning the computation of the annual income and corpus of the estate of the veteran for purposes of determining annual attributable income. Outlines the various types of health care, services, and other benefits to which such qualifying veterans are entitled. Directs the Secretary to contract for needed care for such veterans when Department of Veterans Affairs facilities are geographically inaccessible, lack sufficient capacity, or are otherwise incapable of furnishing such care. Outlines requirements for such alternative care. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) repair or replace any prosthetic device, hearing aid, spectacles, or related devices reasonably necessary to a veteran when damaged or destroyed by a fall or other accident; (2) furnish hearing assistance devices to veterans profoundly deaf and entitled to compensation on account of hearing impairment; and (3) contract for nursing home care for any veteran who has been furnished hospital care in the Philippines and who requires protracted nursing home care. Repeals a provision prohibiting the Secretary from furnishing care and treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans for alcohol and drug dependence and abuse after December 31, 1994, and requiring specific appropriation for such program. Repeals a provision limiting the payment of certain beneficiary travel expenses to and from Department medical facilities. Authorizes the Secretary (currently the United States) to recover the cost of certain care and services provided by the Department if such veteran would have received payment for receiving such care or services from a third party."
