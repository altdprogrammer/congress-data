Requires State procedures prohibiting the issuance or renewal of certain professional, occupational, business, and driver's licenses to noncustodial parents who are: (1) delinquent in the payment of child support; or (2) the subject of an outstanding failure to appear warrant related to a child support proceeding on the State's crime information system. Provides for: (1) attachment of bank accounts to satisfy child support arrearages; and (2) the reporting of child support obligations to credit bureaus. Requires State procedures under which each parent of an individual is liable for the financial support of any child of that individual to the extent the individual is unable to provide such support."
