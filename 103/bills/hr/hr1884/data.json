Limits such penalties to ten years' imprisonment, unless the offense caused serious physical injury to, or endangered the life of, a patient (up to 20 years' imprisonment) or caused the death of a patient (up to life imprisonment). Specifies that the sentencing court shall order a person convicted of an offense under this title to pay restitution to the patient and any payor for losses sustained as a result of the offense. Provides for criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of health care fraud. Authorizes the Attorney General to make payments of up to $10,000 to persons who furnish information unknown to the Government relating to a possible prosecution for health care fraud, with exceptions. Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Attorneys, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to hire, equip, and train personnel in connection with the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud cases. Includes within the scope of the mail fraud statute cases involving matter to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier. Title II: Health Care Fraud and Abuse Commission Act of 1993 - Health Care Fraud and Abuse Commission Act of 1993 - Establishes the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Commission to investigate the nature, magnitude, and cost of health care fraud and abuse and develop methods for its prevention, detection, and prosecution or litigation. Authorizes appropriations."
