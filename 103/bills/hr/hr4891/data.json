    "text": "United States China Policy Act of 1994 - Affirms the President's policy and makes specified recommendations for the conduct of U.S. policy toward China, including those for promoting human rights. Makes it U.S. policy to promote: (1) an effective legal system based on the rule of law; (2) respect for human rights; (3) the emergence of civil society; and (4) the creation of institutions that provide humane and effective governance. Earmarks U.S. Information Agency funds to carry out such objectives. Makes additional funds available for international broadcasting to China. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, in the event that international humanitarian organizations undertake activities in China related to the treatment of prisoners, the President should make available an additional contribution to such organizations to support such activities. Endorses President Clinton's efforts to work with U.S. business leaders to develop voluntary principles to advance human rights in China and commends U.S. companies that have adopted such principles. Urges the President to encourage other governments to adopt similar principles. Authorizes the President to establish a U.S. commission on law and society in the People's Republic of China."
