Establishes in the Treasury the Invest in America Fund and requires deposits into the Fund in an amount equal to deposits received from NATO nations for the payment of such costs. Authorizes the appropriation of Fund amounts for various general purposes. Provides for the expedited consideration, in the granting of funds from such appropriations, to State, county, or local areas experiencing a high level of unemployment due to the realignment or closure of a military installation or facility or the cancellation or curtailment of a major defense contract."
