    "text": "Russian River Fisheries and Riverbed Restoration Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct one or more pilot projects on the main channel of the Russian River in California which may be identified in the Russian River Resource Enhancement Plan, to demonstrate measures to reestablish a channel and floodway in dynamic equilibrium with the River and to prevent the down cutting of the River bed. Requires the Chief of the Soil Conservation Service, working through the Resource Conservation Districts and with the California Department of Fish and Game, to carry out high priority fish habitat restoration projects on the River's tributaries or watershed restoration projects that are identified in and are consistent with the objectives of the Program Plan. Directs the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to review the effects of the operation and water release schedule of the Coyote Dam in Mendocino County on bank erosion problems, river channel down cutting, decreases in groundwater supplies and scour of riparian habitat. Requires the Secretary to review the effects that the operation of Warm Springs Dam in Sonoma County will have on fish habitat in Dry Creek and downstream reaches of the River, including potential effects that the project will have on the middle reach of the River when fully operational. Establishes the Russian River Basin Advisory Committee to advise and assist the Administrator and the Chief regarding the implementation and monitoring of the activities authorized by this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
