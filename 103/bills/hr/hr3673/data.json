Directs the agency head to pay annually to the pertinent local government an amount equal to the real property taxes computed on the current market value of each parcel of private land acquired by it after October 1, 1992, other than by contemporaneous land exchange. States that if such payment is made to a State or local government with respect to a parcel of land under this Act, the payment shall be reduced in proportion to the payment in lieu of real property taxes, if any, which is made relating to the same parcel of land under any other Federal law. Authorizes appropriations."
