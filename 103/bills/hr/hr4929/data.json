Authorizes the Secretary to make such grants only if: (1) the applicant agrees that project services involved will be provided in the language and cultural context most appropriate for the individuals served; and (2) an application is submitted in such form and manner, and contains such agreements, assurances, and information, as the Secretary determines to be necessary. Authorizes appropriations."
