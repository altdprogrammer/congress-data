    "text": "Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 1993 - Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 regarding title to intellectual property arising from cooperative research and developments agreements (CRADAs) to: (1) direct Federal laboratories to ensure that such title is assigned to the collaborating parties to the CRADA in exchange for reasonable compensation to the Federal laboratory; (2) authorize a Federal laboratory to retain (and practice on a worldwide basis) a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license from the collaborating parties for such property; and (3) authorize a Federal laboratory to require a collaborating partner to grant a license to use such property to a responsible applicant. Defines intellectual property rights as: (1) \"patents\" in the case of Government-owned, Government-operated Federal laboratories; and (2) \"patents, copyrights, and computer chip mask work registration\" in the case of Government-owned, contractor-operated Federal laboratories. Sets forth a framework for the distribution of income from intellectual property received by Federal agencies or laboratories. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on the effectiveness of the income-sharing programs established under this Act. Amends the Bayh-Dole Act to grant this Act precedence over its provisions."
