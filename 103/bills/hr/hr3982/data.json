Removes provisions which prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing a permit for the disposal of radioactive waste in the ocean until the permit applicant prepares a Radioactive Material Disposal Impact Assessment. Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect the transportation of material containing de minimis levels of radioactivity for purposes of dumping it into ocean waters under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972."
