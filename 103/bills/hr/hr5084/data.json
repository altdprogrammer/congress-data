Directs the Secretary to provide officials who are designated as census liaisons by local governments with access to census address information for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the Bureau's address information for census and survey purposes and together with such access, provide an explanation of duties and obligations under this Act. Limits such access to the addresses within the local government represented by the census liaison or an adjacent local government. Requires the Bureau to respond to each recommendation made by a census liaison concerning the accuracy of address information, including the determination (and reasons therefor) of the Bureau regarding each such recommendation. Prohibits a census liaison from using information made available under this Act for purposes other than the purposes specified in this Act. Makes provisions that require, with exceptions, that such information be treated as confidential applicable to local government census liaisons. Imposes a fine and up to five years' imprisonment on whoever being or having been a census liaison wrongfully discloses such information. Requires: (1) the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, acting through the Chief Statistician, to develop an appeals process for those States and local governments which desire to appeal determinations of the Bureau; and (2) the Postal Service to provide to the Secretary for use by the Bureau such address, address- related, and point of postal delivery information, including postal delivery codes, determined by the Secretary to be appropriate for any census or survey being conducted by the Bureau."
