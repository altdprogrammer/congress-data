Establishes general labeling requirements, including that any required cautionary statement be displayed in English, in conspicuous and legible type (consistent with specified Federal regulations), and in its entirety on the principal display panel of the product's package, on any descriptive material accompanying the product, in the case of bulk sales of such product when unpackaged, on any bin, any container for retail display, and any vending machine from which the product is dispensed. Sets forth exceptions, including for products manufactured outside the United States. Treats a balloon, ball, marble, toy, or game that is not in compliance with labeling requirements as a misbranded hazardous substance. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) preemption; (2) reporting requirements; and (3) confidentiality.
