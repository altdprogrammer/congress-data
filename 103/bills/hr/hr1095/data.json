Prohibits the amount of honorarium accepted from exceeding the usual and customary fee for the services for which the honorarium is paid, up to $2,000. Subjects the acceptance of any honorarium to financial disclosure. Requires the rules and regulations of each supervising ethics office (ethics office) designated under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to include procedures under which certain senior level or high-salaried noncareer officers and employees must notify their respective ethics office before accepting any of the honoraria permitted above that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed $200 in value from any one source in a calendar year. Requires each ethics office to compile and make public all notifications received during each calendar quarter. Subjects to specified penalties any person who fails to notify the appropriate ethics office before accepting honoraria. Amends the Federal criminal code to waive certain postemployment restrictions on Members of Congress and congressional employees and on certain senior executive branch personnel with respect to a communication or appearance made solely on behalf of a candidate for Federal or State office, in his or her capacity as a candidate, a political party, or certain political organizations, with specified exceptions."
