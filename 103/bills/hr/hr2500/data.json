Requires that each plan be submitted to each State having jurisdiction over a covered interjurisdictional river and that the director of each State fish and wildlife agency be offered the opportunity to choose whether the strategy will apply to that State. Mandates a pilot test and report to the Congress regarding the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement, including: (1) the impacts of navigation, flood control, power generation, irrigation, and municipal water supplies projects on Mississippi River drainage basin fishery resources; and (2) a comprehensive study of the management, research, and restoration needs of the fisheries of the river's drainage system. Authorizes appropriations."
