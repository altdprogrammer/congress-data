Requires that projects be designed to demonstrate a reduction in costs, an increase in access to care, and improvements in the quality of care. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Attorney General to issue a three-year certificate of review to medical facilities that enter into cooperative agreements with respect to the provision of expensive, capital-intensive medical technology or other highly resource-intensive services. Prohibits criminal or civil antitrust actions against a facility for conduct in compliance with a certificate. Allows any person injured as a result of conduct engaged in under a certificate to specified relief."
