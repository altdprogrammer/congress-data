Requires the Director of Recycling Research and Information to: (1) make grants for studies and scientific research relating to recycling of postconsumer materials; and (2) conduct a public outreach program. Requires each manufacturer of a recyclable product to provide for the recycling of increasing minimum percentages of the products manufactured during specified years. Prohibits manufacturing a product for which the prescribed recycling rate was not met for the preceding year. Prohibits manufacturing a nonrecyclable product if a recyclable substitute is readily available. Directs the Secretary to designate a product as nonrecyclable if it is not technically or economically feasible to be recycled. Authorizes nonrecyclable products to be so labeled. Provides for recycling seals of approval for recyclable products and for products containing a certain percentage of recycled postconsumer materials. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to revise provisions concerning Federal procurement of recycled goods. Applies procurement requirements to: (1) Federal agencies that have procured over $10,000 of items; and (2) other entities that have used funds appropriated to a Federal agency to which such procurement policies apply. Prohibits Federal agencies, for purposes of determining whether to procure items composed of recovered materials, from determining that a price is unreasonable unless it exceeds by more than ten percent the price of items not meeting the recovered materials content standards. Sets forth: (1) specification requirements for procuring agencies; and (2) deadlines for the issuance of guidelines by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the procurement of specified items. Directs the Administrator to review and increase the minimum content standards for procured items every four years. Revises provisions concerning the affirmative procurement program. Requires manufacturers of items to provide vendors with certifications of the minimum recovered materials content used or to be used in such items."
