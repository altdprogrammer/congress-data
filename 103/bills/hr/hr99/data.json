Directs the Secretary, at the President's request, to provide until April 1, 1994, further additional funds of up to $10 billion to the RTC out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated to it. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary shall begin to take necessary measures to implement the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 regarding the capitalization of the Savings Association Insurance Fund."
