Directs the President, upon request, to designate a personal representative who, together with representatives designated by the government of the area, shall consult in good faith and develop Articles of Relations and Self-Government. Declares that, upon enactment by the Congress of a resolution approving the proposed Articles, they shall be submitted to the citizens of the insular area in a local government-organized plebiscite and shall take effect if ratified by a majority vote."
