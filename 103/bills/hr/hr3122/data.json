    "text": "Veterans' Long-Term Care Act of 1993 - Defines \"long-term care,\" for veterans' benefits purposes, as a continuum of institutional and noninstitutional programs and services that provide restorative care and support through a time period generally exceeding 90 days. Makes eligible for long-term care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs any veteran: (1) being treated for a service-connected disability (SCD); (2) who has an SCD of 50 percent or more, for the treatment of any disability; (3) who is eligible for pension from the Department, for the treatment of any disability; and (4) for any disability resulting from Department treatment. Authorizes the Secretary to provide long-term care to certain nonqualifying veterans when medically necessary and subject to facility availability. Requires the Secretary to establish a schedule of long-term care copayments, and a long-term care coinsurance plan. Deems Department long-term care providers to be Medicare participating providers for purposes of Medicare payments under the Social Security Act. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with non-Department facilities for the provision of long-term care for veterans when Department facilities are inaccessible or otherwise incapable of providing such care. Requires such facilities to meet certain standards. Authorizes the provision of in-kind assistance to such facilities in lieu of payments. Authorizes the Secretary to provide social support services, including personal care and homemaker services, as part of long-term care services provided. Directs the Secretary to designate geographic areas of the United States as veterans' service areas in which long-term care will be available. Requires a report. Requires operation of such service areas by October 1, 1999. Directs the Secretary to regularly assess Department needs for new long-term care services. Establishes in the Treasury the Veterans' Long-Term Care Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements for the establishment on Department property of veterans' continuing care facilities in which veterans reside while receiving appropriate care. Requires a Department medical center, outpatient clinic, or nursing home to be colocated with such facilities. Requires at such facilities the establishement of a team of primary care providers to be known as the Veterans' Continuing Care Center Health team. Requires congressional reports."
