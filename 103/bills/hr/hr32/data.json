    "text": "Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the Maurice River, the Menantico Creek, the Manumuskin River, and the Muskee Creek in New Jersey as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to administer such segments in association with appropriate political jurisdictions and in accordance with plans prepared by the Cumberland County Department of Planning and Development and respective municipal governments. Authorizes the Secretary to provide planning assistance and enter into agreements to ensure that State and Federal programs are carried out in a manner that is consistent with river management plans. Directs the Secretary to review compliance with the locally adopted river management plans biennially and to report to appropriate congressional committees on any deviation which may diminish the values for which the river was designated. Encourages the Secretary to work with municipalities to negotiate agreement for designating additional segments of the Maurice River and its tributaries and report to the Congress thereon. Authorizes appropriations. Excludes such designated segments from provisions under the Act that authorize Federal acquisitions of lands within the segments' boundaries."
