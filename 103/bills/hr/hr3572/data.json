Defines a \"Phase I Environmental Site Assessment\" as a process by which a person determines whether a parcel of real property is subject to recognized environmental conditions which indicate the likely presence of a hazardous substance or petroleum product and the likely release into the ground, groundwater, or surface water. Provides for approval of an organization if it meets minimum standards for curriculum, program, facilities, training, and certification methods. Makes such approval valid for up to five years. Bars unapproved organizations from issuing degrees signifying that a recipient is a certified environmental site assessor or qualified to perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. Prescribes civil penalties for such violation. Authorizes appropriations."
