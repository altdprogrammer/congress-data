    "text": "Violent Repeat Offender Incarceration Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to individual States and to States organized as multi-State compacts to develop, expand, modify, or improve correctional facilities and programs to ensure that prison cell space is available for the confinement of violent repeat offenders. Sets eligibility requirements for such grants, including assurances that: (1) the States have implemented, or will implement, correctional policies and programs designed to provide sufficiently severe punishment for violent repeat offenders; (2) the prison time served is appropriately related to the determination that the inmate is a violent repeat offender and is for a period of time deemed necessary to protect the public; (3) the States have implemented policies that provide for recognition of victims' rights and needs; (4) funds received will be used for correctional facilities and programs that ensure that prison space is available for the confinement of violent repeat offenders and to supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, and local funds; and (5) the States have a comprehensive correctional plan which represents an integrated approach to the management and operation of correctional facilities and programs. Requires documentation of a multi-State compact agreement specifying the development, expansion, modification, or improvement of correctional facilities and programs. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent of the costs. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) request the Directors of the National Institute of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to provide technical assistance and training to States that receive a grant; and (2) assist with an evaluation of programs established with funds under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
