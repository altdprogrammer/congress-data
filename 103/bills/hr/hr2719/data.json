    "text": "Defense Reuse Community Partnership Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, in order to fulfill responsibilities under the base closure laws, to contract with independent entities (site managers) for the management of site planning, approval, preparation, and disposal of excess and surplus real property at military installations to be closed or realigned under a base closure law. Prohibits each site manager chosen, during the term of the contract and five years thereafter, from bidding on or acquiring any real property located at such installation. Outlines site manager qualifications and general duties. Requires the appraisal of each proposed sale parcel at each such military installation. Directs a site manager and the Secretary to develop a detailed budget for each phase of the site preparation and approval process for each installation. Directs the site manager to sell site parcels after obtaining all required approvals. Divides the sale proceeds between the Department of Defense, the site manager, and appropriate local authorities in a specified priority. Requires certain reports."
