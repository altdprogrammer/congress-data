Authorizes the Secretary to utilize the resources of Fort Wadsworth for any other purposes consistent with the community reuse plan or other initiatives for Naval Station New York. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into: (1) appropriate leases or other agreements with any person, firm, association, organization, corporation, or governmental entity for the use of any property within Fort Wadsworth, Fort Hancock, and Floyd Bennett Field in accordance with the general management plan for the Area or for any of the purposes set forth in the Act establishing such Area; (2) appropriate leases or other agreements with any Federal agency to house its employees engaged in activities or programs at Fort Wadsworth, Fort Hancock, Floyd Bennett Field, or in the New York City metropolitan area; and (3) interagency permitting agreements or other appropriate agreements with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Transportation, and other Federal agencies to locate their activities and house their employees at Fort Wadsworth, Fort Hancock, and Floyd Bennett Field. Requires the Secretary to establish competitive bidding procedures to be used for the issuance of such leases. Requires proceeds from the leases, concession, other use authorizations, and services that may be provided by the Area to be retained by the Secretary and credited to the appropriation bearing the cost of preservation, restoration, maintenance, improvement, repair, and related expenses incurred by the Secretary with respect to Fort Wadsworth, Fort Hancock, and Floyd Bennett Field properties, with the balance used to defray other costs incurred by the Secretary in the administration of such properties.
