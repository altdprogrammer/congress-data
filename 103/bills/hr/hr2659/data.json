    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1994-03-24", 
    "text": "Organ Transplant Program Reauthorization Act of 1994 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the grant program for organ procurement organizations and other public or nonprofit institutions to increase organ donation through public education programs, training individuals to request organ donations, and providing technical assistance to organ-procuring organizations and hospitals. Requires priority to be given to grant requests designed to alleviate organ shortages for minority and other populations where there is a greater degree of organ shortages relative to the general population. Revises requirements of organ procurement organizations to increase the rate of donations, including: (1) evaluation of their effectiveness in acquiring organs, especially among minority populations; (2) assessment of the variations in procurement among hospitals within their region; and (3) development of plans to increase procurement for minorities and other populations experiencing organ shortages. Requires the Office of Technology Assessment to report to specified congressional committees on a study of organ procurement organizations. (Sec. 3) Requires participation by transplant recipients and their families on the boards of organ procurement organizations and on the board of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Provides for the more equitable allocation of organ donations. (Sec. 4) Directs the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees on the prevalence and distribution of organ transplants to foreign nationals and nonresident aliens, the equitable allocation systems for organs, and the composition of board membership of organ procurement organizations and the Network. (Sec. 5) Extends the authorization of appropriations for the grant program for organ procurement organizations until FY 1996. (Sec. 6) Comprehensive Child Immunization Act of 1994 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to mandate establishment of a list of the vaccines that the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommends for administration to all children and a recommended administration schedule. Makes the list and schedule subordinate to State law. Mandates allotments to States. Provides for the establishment of State registries to monitor the immunization status of all children. Requires States to: (1) allow parents to opt out of the registry; and (2) monitor and enforce compliance with these provisions by health care providers. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes a national immunization surveillance program to assess the effects of these provisions, provide technical assistance to States, and receive aggregate epidemiologic data collected by States. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the distribution, without charge, of pediatric vaccines purchased by the Secretary to health care providers who are: (1) members of a uniformed service; (2) U.S. officers or employees; (3) federally qualified health centers; (4) migrant or community health centers; (5) entities providing health services for the homeless or for residents of public housing; or (6) public or nonprofit entities receiving funds under provisions of the Social Security Act relating to special projects of regional and national significance. Prohibits a provider receiving the vaccine from imposing a charge for the vaccine but allows a charge for the actual costs of the administration of the vaccine. Mandates activities to improve Federal, State, and local vaccine delivery systems and immunization outreach and education efforts, including a National Immunization Public Awareness Campaign and incorporation of immunization status assessments and referral in the application process for various types of Federal assistance. Authorizes grants to States to develop, revise, and implement immunization improvement plans. Requires States to establish child immunization rate goals. Authorizes appropriations. Requires States to report annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with an estimate of the percentage of two-year-olds who have received specified immunizations, mandating: (1) grants to States that exceed certain percentages; and (2) reinvestment of specified grant percentages in immunization activities. Mandates: (1) a biennial report on the costs, efficiency, and effectiveness of procedures established to deliver vaccine to health care providers; and (2) a report by the National Academy of Sciences on the role of the National Vaccine Program established under this title in achieving progress toward the established immunization goals for the year 2000. Requires that the Vaccine Injury Table of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program include any vaccine on the list established under this subtitle. Allows a special master to award reasonable attorneys' fees whether or not an election has been made to file a civil action regarding a vaccine injury compensation petition. Requires that compensation under the Program be used as determined by the special master to be in the best interests of the petitioner. (Current law requires that the compensation be used, with the consent of the petitioner, as determined by the special master to be in the best interests of the petitioner.) Sets time limits regarding applications for attorneys' fees and costs. Authorizes appropriations for payment of compensation under the Program regarding vaccines administered before the effective date of the Program. Revises requirements regarding: (1) time limits on actions when the Table is revised; and (2) extensions of time limits for decisions. Mandates an annual report on amounts collected under provisions regarding subrogation of petitioners' rights. Requires the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines to monitor the balance of the Vaccine Injury Trust Fund and recommend changes in the tax per dose. Revises requirements regarding vaccine information materials. Authorizes appropriations from the Trust Fund for administering the National Vaccine Program. Removes provisions authorizing grants for research on the prevention and control of diseases through vaccination and related demonstration projects, public information programs, and health professionals training and clinical skills improvement. Allows malpractice coverage, in certain circumstances, for officers, employees, and contractors of entities that are migrant or community health centers or that provide health services for the homeless or for residents of public housing when they provide services to individuals who are not patients of the entities. Requires that appropriations for a malpractice claim fund be made separate from the appropriations for such entities."
