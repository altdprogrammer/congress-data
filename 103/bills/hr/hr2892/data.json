    "text": "Violent Crime Control and Regional Prison Partnership Act of 1993 - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish a Regional Prison Task Force comprised of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and a senior correctional officer of each State wishing to participate, designated by the Governor of the State; and (2) create a plan, in consultation with the Task Force, for the establishment of a nationwide regional prison system. Requires the plan to: (1) define the boundaries and number of regions in which regional prisons will be placed; (2) establish the terms of the partnership agreements that States must enter into with the Attorney General in order to participate in the regional prison system; (3) set forth the role of the Federal Bureau of Prisoners in administering the prisons; (4) determine the way two or more States in a region will share responsibility for the activities associated with such prisons; and (5) specify both the Federal responsibility and the State responsibility (which shall not be less than 50 percent) for construction and operating costs of such prisons. Prohibits a State from sending prisoners to be held at a regional prison unless such State: (1) enters into a partnership under this Act and abides substantially by its terms; (2) establishes minimum mandatory sentences of ten years for persons who are convicted of a serious felony and are subsequently convicted of a crime of violence involving the use of a firearm or a crime of violence involving a sexual assault; (3) establishes a truth in sentencing policy under which offenders will serve no less than 85 percent of the term of imprisonment to which they are sentenced after specified dates; (4) provides pretrial detention similar to that provided in the Federal system; (5) takes steps to eliminate court-imposed limitations on its prison capacity resulting from consent decrees or statutory provisions; and (6) provides specified assurances. Sets forth provisions regarding prisoner eligibility. Establishes in the U.S. Treasury a Regional Prison Fund. Authorizes appropriations."
