    "text": "Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for intentionally: (1) injuring, intimidating, or interfering with any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction because that person is engaging in activities in an animal enterprise; or (2) damaging or destroying the property of a facility because that facility is in part or in whole such an enterprise. Defines \"animal enterprise\" as a commercial or academic enterprise that uses animals for food or fiber production, agriculture, research, or testing; a zoo, aquarium, circus, rodeo, or lawful competitive animal event; or any fair or similar event intended to advance agriculture. Provides for civil actions by aggrieved persons, the U.S. Attorney General, and State attorneys general. Specifies that the Congress does not intend this Act to provide exclusive remedies with respect to the conduct prohibited by it, nor to preempt the legislation of States that may provide such remedies."
