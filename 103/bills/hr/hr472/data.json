Directs the Secretary to establish transfer procedures. Sets forth approval criteria. Authorizes foreign persons to purchase more than a specified percentage of the voting interests of a U.S. air carrier under certain conditions. Title II: Airline Passenger Protection - Requires air carriers that provide air transportation between the same locations as air carriers that become debtors under the bankruptcy laws to provide, on a space available basis, air transportation for persons holding airline tickets sold by the debtor air carrier. Requires the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider: (1) methods of ensuring that each air carrier provides enough seats for persons redeeming frequent flyer awards; (2) requirements to ensure that such air carrier give members of its frequent flyer program adequate notice of material changes in such program; and (3) whether or not frequent flyer mileage obtained under one air carrier's frequent flyer program should be transferable to another air carrier's frequent flyer program as a means of reducing the anticompetitive effects of such program."
