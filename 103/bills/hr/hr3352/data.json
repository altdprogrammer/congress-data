Makes such workers eligible for assistance if the Secretary of Labor determines that a significant number of the workers in a firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and either: (1) the sales or production, or both, of such firm decreased, imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm have increased, and the increase in such articles contributed to such workers' separation or threat of separation and to the decline in the firm's sales or production; or (2) there has been a shift in production by the workers' firm to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm. Authorizes a group of workers, including workers in any agricultural firm, or their recognized union to file with the Governor of a State a petition for certification of eligibility to apply for such assistance. Prohibits a worker from receiving duplicative assistance. Authorizes appropriations."
