Requires that, as early as practicable in each new Congress, any congressional committee which anticipates considering proposed legislation establishing, amending, or reauthorizing any Federal program likely to have a significant budgetary impact on State, local, or tribal governments request the CBO Director to study such proposed legislation to develop information that may be useful in analyzing the costs of any Federal mandates, especially unfunded Federal mandates, that may be included in it. Requires the Director to prepare and submit to the appropriate committee estimates for each public bill or joint resolution reported by an authorization committee of the costs of all mandates in the particular legislation. Authorizes appropriations to CBO to carry out this Act. Sets forth guidelines for congressional consideration of measures reported by authorization committees, making it out of order, for example, to consider legislation containing a Federal mandate which does not contain funding for it, subject to waiver under certain conditions. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives with regard to voting for measures containing mandates, adding requirements for a seven-day layover for certain measures. Title II: Regulatory Accountability and Reform - Requires each agency to assess the effects of Federal regulations on States, and local and tribal governments, including the specific availability of resources to carry out any mandates in those regulations, and seek to minimize those burdens that uniquely or significantly affect such governmental entities, consistent with achieving statutory and regulatory objectives. Requires each agency to: (1) develop an effective process to permit elected officials and other representatives of such governments to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant Federal mandates; and (2) develop a plan for providing appropriate notice to, seeking views from, and advising small governments on compliance with any regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect them before establishing such requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Requires agencies to prepare certain cost-benefit and other statements before promulgating any final rule that includes any Federal mandates upon States or local or tribal governments that may result in expenditures by them in excess of a certain amount in any one year, and before promulgation of any general notice of proposed rulemaking likely to result in promulgation of any such rule. Requires the OMB Director to: (1) collect from agencies the statements prepared under this subtitle and provide copies to the CBO Director promptly after promulgation of the general notice of proposed rulemaking or of the final rule for which the statement was prepared; and (2) establish certain pilot programs to test approaches for reducing reporting and compliance burdens on small governments. Title III: Judicial Review - Disallows judicial review of any action or noncompliance committed under this Act. Title IV: Baseline Study - Requires the Director of the Bureau of the Census to study certain issues involved in calculating the total costs and benefits to State, local, and tribal governments of compliance with Federal law. Authorizes appropriations. Title V: Limitation on Implementation of Federal Mandates; Review and Monitoring of Unfunded Federal Mandates and Implementation of Act - Federal Mandate and Community Assistance Reform Act - Requires the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to: (1) investigate and review on a regular basis the role of unfunded Federal mandates in intergovernmental relations and their impact on local, State, and Federal Government objectives and responsibilities; (2) study and make certain recommendations to the President and the Congress regarding, among other things, flexibility for State and local government compliance with specific unfunded Federal mandates for which terms of compliance are unnecessarily rigid or complex; and (3) monitor and evaluate the implementation of this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Title VI: Private Sector Costs - Private Sector Legislative Analysis Act of 1994 - Requires that, at the beginning of each Congress, the majority leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House prepare for the CBO Director a list of major legislative proposals that they believe are likely to have a significant economic impact and be considered for enactment. Requires that House and Senate leadership review for modification each proposal in such list before adjournment of the first session of each Congress. Requires the Director, upon receiving such a list, to initiate a study of each of the major proposals, topics, and areas of interest in the list for purposes of studying and estimating its economic impact, comparing congressional committee and Federal agency estimates of the impacts of such proposals, topics, or areas. Provides for guidelines for congressional consideration of any bill or joint resolution that is included on such a list."
