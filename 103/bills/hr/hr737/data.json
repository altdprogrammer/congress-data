Specifies that each such defendant shall be held strictly liable in tort for all direct and consequential damages arising from bodily injury, death, and property damage proximately resulting from the discharge of the weapon, with exceptions for: (1) injury while committing a felony; (2) self-inflicted injury; (3) injury by a law enforcement officer; (4) injury by a member of the U.S. armed forces; and (5) injury by a security guard. Authorizes the court to allow the prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney's fee. Sets a two-year statute of limitations that begins with the date the injury is discovered. Makes this title applicable only to weapons manufactured in or imported into the United States after the effective date of this Act. Title II: Report to Victims on Federal Crimes Committed with Firearms - Requires the U.S. attorney prosecuting a case, after a conviction is obtained in any Federal court of a crime during or in relation to which an individual was injured or killed by a firearm, to report on whether title I of this Act applies to the firearm, to the individual, or, if the individual is dead, to the closest relative of the individual (or, if there is no such relative, the estate of the individual). Title III: Revenue Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the tax on firearms. Imposes a floor stock tax on specified firearms. Establishes in the Treasury a Hospital Gunshot Cost Relief Trust Fund to assist hospitals located in urban areas in defraying costs incurred in providing medical care to gunshot victims who are not covered under any health plan."
