    "text": "Pollution Prevention, Community Recycling, and Incinerator Control Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the issuance of permits for construction or expansion of municipal solid waste incinerators. Prohibits Federal agencies, State or local governments, or other waste management jurisdictions from issuing permits to such incinerators after December 31, 1999, unless the applicant demonstrates that: (1) an annual waste composition analysis of the solid waste generated within the area to be served by the facility is conducted; (2) specified percentages of certain waste categories are diverted to waste management methods other than incineration; (3) the facility will not interfere with diversion rates; (4) it is not feasible to manage the remaining solid waste through source reduction, reuse, or recycling; (5) the facility will not adversely affect the environment, human health, or the local economy and is not situated in a nonattainment area identified under the Clean Air Act; (6) the full cost of the facility over its entire life will be less costly than reducing, recycling, or composting waste; (7) the waste management jurisdiction conducts a public participation process; (8) the proposed construction or expansion is approved by the affected unit of local government; (9) firms operating the facility are in compliance with environmental and public health statutes, have paid outstanding fines for violations of such statutes, and make disclosure statements available; and (10) an approved environmental impact statement is completed. Treats ash from municipal solid waste incinerators as a hazardous waste. Requires such ash to be managed in a monofill that contains only such ash and meets specified design requirements. Prohibits the use of such ash for any purpose. Prohibits the incineration of household hazardous waste, batteries, chlorinated plastics, consumer electronics, and yard waste in such incinerators. Prohibits the issuance of permits or prior approval for the construction or expansion of hazardous waste incinerators unless requirements similar to those for municipal solid waste incinerators have been met. Directs hazardous waste management permit applicants to demonstrate that the State in which the incinerator is located, and each State in which generators of hazardous waste to be incinerated at the facility are located, are implementing toxics use reduction programs. Applies this Act to any facility that burns hazardous waste."
