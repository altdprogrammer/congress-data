Directs the Secretary to review the existing System to determine whether there are more appropriate alternatives for managing specific units within the System and to develop a report containing a list of areas where National Park Service management should be modified or terminated. Establishes a National Park System Review Commission to make and report such determinations if the Secretary fails to transmit the report within a specified time period. Title II: New Area Establishment - Removes certain reporting requirements concerning additional areas for the National Park System. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual list of areas recommended for study for potential inclusion in the System to specified congressional committees. Bars the initiation of any study of the potential of an area for inclusion in the System after this Act's enactment, except by specific authorization by an Act of the Congress. Requires studies to be completed within three fiscal years of the enactment date of legislation providing for study. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual list of areas which have been studied previously which contain primarily cultural or historical resources and areas which contain primarily natural resources in numerical order of priority for addition to the System."
