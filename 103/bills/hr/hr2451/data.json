Requires such grant funds to be obtained from FY 1994 Department of Defense research, development, test, and evaluation funds. Provides research institution selection criteria. Requires such research to focus on persons who may have been exposed to environmental hazards or chemical substances while serving on active duty on Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War.
