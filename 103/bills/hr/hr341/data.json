    "text": "Sweatshops Prevention Act of 1993 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the civil and criminal penalties (and liability for settlements) for employers who violate standards for minimum wages, overtime, and child labor. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to seize garments, up to the value of the employer's liability under the FLSA, from the premises of a garment manufacturer employer who has violated any such standards more than two times in a three-year period. Authorizes seizures of all garments produced by homeworkers in violation of the FLSA (or up to the employer's liability if the employer has obtained a certificate to employ such homeworkers but has violated its terms). Sets forth procedural requirements. Amends the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 to extend the statute of limitations on actions to enforce unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime compensation, or liquidated damages under the FLSA, Walsh-Healey Act, or Davis-Bacon Act. Directs the Secretary to establish and encourage closer working relationships among Federal and State agencies responsible for enforcing labor, safety and health, and immigration laws."
