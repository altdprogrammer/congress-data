Gives the Department of State access to the National Crime Information Center and other Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal records for passport, visa, and other immigration related matters. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make membership in a terrorist organization a ground for exclusion from admission into the United States. Requires a U.S. consular official, before issuing a visa to an alien for U.S. admission, to certify that a check of the system has been made and that there is no basis for such alien's exclusion."
