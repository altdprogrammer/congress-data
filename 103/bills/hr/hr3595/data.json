Makes exceptions if the handgun is: (1) used to attend a course of instruction in hunter safety or firearms safety that is conducted by a certified instructor; (2) used for practice, target shooting, or hunting in accordance with State and local law; (3) unloaded and locked in a container while traveling to or from the hunter or firearms safety activities; (4) possessed by the individual, with the consent of his or her parent or legal guardian, on real property that is owned or leased by them; or (5) transferred with the consent of the parent or legal guardian of the individual, with an exception.
