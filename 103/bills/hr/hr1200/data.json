(Sec. 303) Defines a \"comprehensive health service organization\" (CHSO) as a public or private organization which, in return for a capitated payment amount, furnishes or arranges a full range of health services and out-of-area coverage in the case of urgently needed services to an identified population in a specified service area which enrolls voluntarily in the organization. Sets forth various CHSO requirements regarding enrollment, withdrawal for cause, accessibility of services, continuity of care, consumer and provider representation on the board of directors, a patient grievance program, medical standards committees, premiums, utilization and bonus information, provision of services to enrollees at institutions operating under global budgets, marketing of services, and provision of emergency services to nonenrollees.

(Sec. 414) Directs the Board to provide for the assignment of a unique identifier to each participating provider and to each individual eligible for services, which shall be used for claims and payment. Title V: Quality Assessment - Directs the Quality Council to: (1) collect data from outcomes research on an ongoing basis and develop practice guidelines on the basis of such data and existing clinical knowledge; (2) adopt methodologies for profiling the patterns of practice of health care professionals and for identifying outliers (i.e., health care providers whose patterns of practice suggest quality deficiencies); (3) develop standards for the development of centers of excellence for designated procedures and for education of and sanctions for outliers; and (4) disseminate all quality guidelines and standards to the States for implementation.

Mandates that the quality review entity be administratively independent of the individual or board that administers the program and not provide any financial incentive to reviewers to favor one pattern of practice over another. (Sec. 503) Expresses the intent to replace random utilization controls with a systematic review of patterns of practice that compromise the quality of care by January 1, 1998. Supercedes all existing Federal utilization review programs, including random case-by-case reviews and programs requiring pre-certification of medical procedures on a case-by-case basis, with exceptions. Specifies that nothing in this section shall preclude case management of catastrophic, mental health, or substance abuse cases where necessary to achieve appropriate, cost-effective, and beneficial comprehensive medical care.

Permits the use of statistical models to estimate State capitation amounts. Sets forth State adjustment factors to reflect differences in relative needs for funds and directs that such factors be applied in a budget-neutral manner resulting in no change in total Federal expenditures from the national per capita average. (Sec. 603) Requires each program to submit to the Board a proposed and final annual budget broken into quality assessment, professional training, administrative, and operating components, with the operating component broken into facility-based services, individual practitioner payments, payments to CHSOs, and payments for other items and services.

Permits programs to provide for a process for the approval of capital expenditures based on information derived from regional planning agencies.

Permits programs to adjust payments amounts within their budgets to encourage provision of appropriate services in underserved areas. (Sec. 619) Authorizes programs to utilize alternative payment methodologies, provided that such methodologies do not affect the entitlement of individuals to coverage, the weighting of fee schedules to encourage an increase in the number of primary care providers, the ability of individuals to choose among qualified providers, the benefits covered under the Program, or compliance with the State health security budget. Requires States to report on the operation and effectiveness of alternative methodologies to enable the Board to evaluate the appropriateness of applying such methodologies to other States.
