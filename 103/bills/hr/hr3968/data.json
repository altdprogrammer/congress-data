    "text": "Violent Repeat Offender Incarceration Act - Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to individual States and to States organized as multi-State compacts to develop, expand, modify or improve (develop) correctional facilities and programs to ensure that prison cell space is available for the confinement of violent repeat offenders. Sets eligibility requirements for such grants, including assurances that: (1) the States have implemented, or will implement, correctional policies and programs designed to provide sufficiently severe punishment for violent repeat offenders, including violent juvenile offenders, and that the prison time served is appropriately related to the determination that the inmate is a violent repeat offender and is for a period deemed necessary to protect the public; (2) the States have implemented policies that provide for recognition of victims' rights and needs; (3) funds received will be used to develop correctional facilities and programs to ensure that prison space is available for the confinement of violent repeat offenders and will be used to supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, and local funds; (4) the States have a comprehensive correctional plan which represents an integrated approach to the management and operation of correctional facilities and programs and meets specified requirements; and (5) the States have involved counties and other units of local government, when appropriate, in the development of correctional facilities and programs designed to ensure the incarceration of violent offenders. Directs the Attorney General, in making such grants, to give special consideration to the special burden placed on States which incarcerate a substantial number of inmates who are in the United States illegally. Authorizes the Attorney General to request: (1) the Directors of the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to provide technical assistance and training to States that receive a grant under this Act to achieve the purposes of this Act; and (2) the Director of the NIC to assist with an evaluation of programs established with funds under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
