States that certain claim settlement payments made by the Administrator to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation shall be credited against BPA payments owed to the Treasury. Directs the Administrator to offer to include provisions in future electric power service contracts that preclude further increases in the refinanced principal amount or interest rate obligations to the Government."
