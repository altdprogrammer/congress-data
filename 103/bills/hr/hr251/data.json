    "text": "Monetary Policy and Treasury Finance Enhancement Act of 1993 - Requires at least ten percent of the aggregate face amount of longer-term public debt obligations (bonds or notes which mature at least five years after the date of issue) issued during a fiscal year to be in the form of indexed obligations. Specifies a higher requirement in certain cases. Allows the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bond and note obligations which mature at least 270 days but less than five years after the date of issue in the form of indexed obligations. Prohibits more than 50 percent of the aggregate face amount of bond or note obligations which mature on any day from being in the form of indexed obligations. Bases indexed obligations on the Consumer Price Index. Provides for the Secretary to determine the amounts, maturities, and timing of issuances of indexed obligations. Requires the Secretary to monitor the ownership and trading activity of indexed and nonindexed obligations having the same maturity dates to assure liquidity and pricing reliability. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on provisions of this Act every two years until the tenth year after enactment. Expresses the intent of the Congress with respect to Federal income tax treatment of indexed and nonindexed obligations."
