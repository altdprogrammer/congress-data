Makes private U.S. shipyards eligible for program financial assistance or participation. Title II: Guarantees of Obligations for Vessel Construction and United States Shipyard Modernization - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to authorize guarantees of obligations for eligible export vessels (defined as vessels constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in the United States which will be placed under the laws of another country). Authorizes such guarantees only if the eligible export vessel: (1) will aid in the transition of U.S. shipyards to commercial activities or preserve shipbuilding assets essential in war or a national emergency; and (2) is not transferred to any country hostile to U.S. interests. Authorizes loan guarantees for advanced shipbuilding technology and modern shipbuilding technology of a general U.S. shipyard facility. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Series Construction Assistance - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay assistance to a U.S. shipyard owner for the construction of any commercial vessel that is one of a series of vessels for which payment of assistance is approved under this title.
