Increases budget authority for Department of Justice regional offices of the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act with regard to unfair immigration-related employment provisions to: (1) authorize penalties collected under such provisions to be used in carrying out enforcement activities; (2) require inclusion of enforcement and related activities in certain reports to the Congress; (3) establish a national toll-free telephone hotline; (4) subject persons who engage in pervasive violations of such provisions to a one-year Federal contract disqualification; and (5) provide for District Office receipt of charges. Directs the Attorney General to appoint a citizens and community group panel, including members of specified Mexican-American organizations, to monitor the application of such anti-discrimination provisions and to report annually to the Attorney General and to the Congress."
