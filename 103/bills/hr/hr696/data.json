Sets forth mitigating and aggravating factors. Establishes procedures for a special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death is justified. Requires the court to: (1) instruct the the jury that, in considering whether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not consider the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim; and (2) impose a sentence of death if the jury (or if there is no jury, the court) returns a recommendation of the death penalty. Sets forth procedures for review and implementation of a sentence of death. Provides for appointment of counsel in Federal capital cases for indigent defendants. Sets standards for competence of counsel. Specifies that appointment of counsel in the Federal habeas corpus review of State capital cases is discretionary."
