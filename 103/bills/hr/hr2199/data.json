Polluter Pays Clean Water Funding Act - Title I: State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to add to the list of projects eligible for State water pollution control revolving fund assistance: (1) coastal nonpoint pollution control programs; (2) wetlands protection, remediation, and restoration; (3) watershed planning and management; (4) public water conservation and reuse; and (5) low-income water and sewer assurance programs. Establishes conditions on a State's authority to make grants from such funds. Makes eligible for grant assistance projects: (1) to be carried out in political subdivisions with 5,000 people or fewer or in communities where water and sewer bills exceed a specified percent of median family income; (2) for control of nonpoint source pollution; and (3) to establish a low-income water and sewer assurance program. Revises allotment provisions concerning State revolving funds to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish an allotment formula based on State populations. Directs the Administrator to establish minimum standards for low-income water and sewer assurance programs eligible for assistance under this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Excise Taxes on Substances Contributing to Water Pollution, Etc. - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on the discharge of any taxable chemical pollutant to water or any publicly owned treatment works. Exempts from such tax discharges of chemical pollutants used exclusively for any residential or farming use or any use by any Federal, State, or local agency. Imposes a tax on any fertilizer, pesticide, or animal feed which is: (1) manufactured or produced in the United States or entered into the United States for consumption use or warehousing; and (2) sold or used by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. Exempts articles which are to be exported or sold for export from such tax. Imposes a tax of 1.95 cents on each thousand gallons of water sold for use or used by the ultimate consumer in a taxable use. Makes persons using the water liable for the tax. Establishes the Clean Water Trust Fund to make expenditures to carry out State water pollution control revolving fund activities."
