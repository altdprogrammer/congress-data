Requires a farm labor contractor to be bonded in order to receive a certificate of registration. Makes existing discretionary grounds for registration refusal mandatory. Establishes discretionary grounds for registration suspension and revocation. Sets forth certain employment disclosure requirements. Extends housing and vehicle safety protections to a worker's accompanying family members. Requires an agricultural employer who uses a farm labor contractor's services to take reasonable steps to determine whether the contractor has a certificate of registration. Increases administrative sanctions for violations of such Act. Establishes a private right of action on a bond. Authorizes an agricultural worker or his or her representative to file a complaint alleging a violation of such Act. Requires an agricultural employer to provide protection against heat stress, field sanitation, and child care (in the case of an employer of at least 25 employees)."
