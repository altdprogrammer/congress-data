Creates a private right of action for violation of Federal law prohibiting employment of unauthorized aliens. Directs the Attorney General to provide grants to the States for immigration assistance and enforcement. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to condition Federal assistance upon assurances that the recipient State actively enforces sanctions against the employment of unauthorized aliens. Amends Federal immigration law to permit complaints alleging employment of unauthorized aliens to be registered in person or by toll-free telephone number. Authorizes the Attorney General to seek judicial review if adversely affected by a final order regarding an assessment for employment of unauthorized aliens. Title II: Improving the Employment Verification System - Restricts the authority of the Attorney General to expand the list of acceptable employment verification documents. Transfers from the President to the Attorney General responsibility for monitoring and evaluating the employment verification system. Directs the Attorney General to report to the Congress on the consolidation into a single tamper-resistant document of documentation evidencing temporary work authorization. Title III: Additional Penalties and Increases in Penalties - Declares alien employment without authorization unlawful and establishes civil penalties. Precludes aliens engaged in unlawful employment from eligibility for adjustment of immigration status. Increases the civil and criminal penalties for: (1) employment of unauthorized aliens; and (2) document fraud."
