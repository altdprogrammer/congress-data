Authorizes certain expenditures for administrative expenses, limiting reception and representation expenses of the Board, Secretary, and Administrator of the Commission. Authorizes the purchase of passenger motor vehicles for replacement only, requiring that certain vehicles purchased be built in the United States. Gives Congress' consent (as required under the Constitution) for Commission employees to accept civil employment with agencies and organizations affiliated with the Government of Panama. Requires that the employment be approved by the Commission's ethics official and the Commission's Administrator. Amends the Panama Canal Act of 1979 to require that certain negotiated grievance and binding arbitration procedures under Federal law be available as if Commission employees were not excluded from specified adverse personnel actions provisions."
