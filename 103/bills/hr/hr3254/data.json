Prohibits the expenditure of FY 1996 funds for the Critical Technologies Institute. Title II: General Provisions - Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to direct the NSF to include in its annual report to the President a strategic plan defining its goals, criteria, and procedures. (Sec. 202) Requires the NSF Director (Director) to submit to the Congress an annual upgrade and maintenance plan for national research facilities. (Sec. 203) Amends the Academic Research Facilities Modernization Act of 1988 to require the NSF Director, when making awards for academic facilities maintenance, to exclude from consideration after FY 1995 certain institutions or consortia which received Federal maintenance funds for projects that were not subjected to a competitive, merit-based award process. (Sec. 204) Prohibits a science-technology center from being disqualified from competition for funding support under NSF informal science education programs on the basis of: (1) geographic location; (2) size of population served; or (3) date on which it commences operations. (Sec. 205) Amends the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to include within its target population women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups. (Sec. 207) Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 and the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1988 to modify certain administrative procedures. Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, 1977 to repeal its mandate for an Office of Small Business Research and Development. (Sec. 209) Requires the Director to establish a program to develop school curriculum materials that promote the relationship of environmental and economic and technical activities. (Sec. 211) Prohibits the awarding of funds to any grantee who reported FY 1994 Federal research grant outlays in excess of $10 million unless such grantee agrees to reimburse NSF from prior unobligated research amounts for any increased indirect expenses. (Sec. 212) Requires grants and contracts to be made on a competitive basis. (Sec. 213) Prohibits grant or contract awards to educational institutions which prevent military recruiting. (Sec. 214) Expresses the sense of the Congress that entities receiving assistance under this Act should purchase only American-made equipment and products. Title III: Academic Research Facilities Modernization - Instructs the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a multiagency Federal program plan to provide financial support to institutions of higher education to modernize obsolete science and engineering research facilities. Title IV: International Scientific Cooperation - Authorizes the Director to: (1) make grants to domestic organizations for \"debt-for-science\" exchanges; and (2) facilitate and participate in the establishment of binational and multinational endowed science foundations. Requires the NSF Director to submit to the Congress a strategic plan for NSF international scientific cooperation activities. Title V: Undergraduate Education - Requires each educational institution receiving a FY 1995 research grant to provide NSF with specified information on its undergraduate mathematics, science, and engineering activities."
