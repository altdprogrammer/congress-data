Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, if the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that such use may present a risk to the public health, to establish a safe level for a residue of an animal drug when used for such different use and require the development of a practical, analytical method for the detection of residues of the drug above the safe level established. Prohibits such use if it results in residues exceeding the safe level."
