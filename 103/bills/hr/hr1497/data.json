    "text": "Prescription Drug Records Privacy Protection Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make any retailer of pharmaceutical products or services, physician, or administrator of a health benefit plan who knowingly discloses personally identifiable information contained in a prescription drug record of an individual liable to such individual. Makes exceptions with respect to any such disclosures: (1) to the individual; (2) with the informed, written consent of the individual; (3) to a law enforcement agency (LEA) pursuant to a warrant, a grand jury subpoena, or a court order; (4) to an LEA or health care agency for the purpose of addressing illegal drug diversion or improving prescribing practices; (5) pursuant to a court order in a civil proceeding upon a showing of compelling need for the information that cannot be accommodated by any other means, subject to specified conditions; and (6) to any person involved in the administration and review of health care services provided to the individual. Sets forth provisions regarding safeguards against unauthorized disclosure where court orders are granted. Permits persons aggrieved by any act of an individual in violation of this Act to bring a civil action in a U.S. district court for actual and punitive damages, costs, and other preliminary and equitable relief, subject to specified limitations."
