Sets forth the board's oversight functions for environmental and waste management activities. Prescribes guidelines under which Federal and State agencies shall provide the board with specified information regarding environmental restoration and waste management activities at the facilities. Directs the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to perform: (1) public health actions for each facility included in certain DOE programmatic environmental impact statements; and (2) an off-site preliminary exposure assessment for each facility in order to identify potential human exposure to contaminants released from hazardous substances at the facility. Permits any person to petition the ATSDR Administrator for public health assessments. Directs the Secretary of Energy and the ATSDR Administrator to develop a long-range strategy for ensuring the substantive involvement of affected States, Indian tribes, communities, and the public in implementing this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
