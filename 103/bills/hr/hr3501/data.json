    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Violent Crimes Title II: Fraud Senior Citizen Protection Act of 1993 - Title I: Violent Crimes - Amends the Federal criminal code to require a mandatory sentence upon conviction of a felony against an individual age 65 or over (elderly victim). Bars the court from suspending such sentence or giving the defendant probation. Requires that such a sentence be served consecutively and that the court reject specified plea agreements. Authorizes the death penalty in any case in which Federal law punishes conduct that is first-degree murder. Title II: Fraud - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to participate in, and be on the receiving list of law enforcement products of, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Center. Revises provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act to authorize: (1) service of process wherever a party may be found in certain cases of fraud; and (2) the FTC to bring a criminal contempt action for violations of orders in such cases. Requires: (1) the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines to provide for increased offense levels based on the number of victims in cases of fraud and deceit and based on victims being elderly; and (2) (current law authorizes) the court to order restitution to victims of specified violations of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) all U.S. Attorneys should regularly enter information on telemarketing fraud into the database of the National Telemarketing Fraud Working Group; and (2) such Group and the States should continue to cooperate in coordinating the prosecution of offenders in venues that are convenient to the victims. Subjects to civil forfeiture any property traceable to the proceeds of violations of specified anti-fraud provisions which relate to crimes against elderly victims. Requires the court to order violators to forfeit property constituting or derived from proceeds obtained as the result of such a violation. Permits up to 25 percent of the amounts so forfeited to be used to provide restitution to victims. Directs: (1) the Attorney General to prepare model State laws on licensing of home repair contractors, mortgage companies, and prize giveaway companies and to designate 50 positions for attorneys and support staff for the prosecution of consumer fraud and for law enforcement and consumer fraud education programs; and (2) the Social Security Administration to conduct a study of Medicaid and social security fraud. Extends mail fraud provisions to cover private courier services."
