    "text": "Veterans' Education and Training Act of 1994 - Provides for the continued use (currently terminates at the end of FY 1994) of veterans' basic educational assistance for approved flight training for regular veterans, post-Vietnam era veterans, and members of the reserves. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to use the facilities of any federally recognized Indian tribe in providing training or work experience for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Allows for the payment of a subsistence allowance to veterans performing training or work on the facilities of such an Indian tribe. (Sec. 4) Includes within the definition of \"educational institution\" for purposes of the provision of educational assistance to veterans, until September 31, 1996, entities that provide training required for the completion of any State-approved alternative teacher certification program. (Sec. 5) Prohibits a veteran eligible for educational assistance from enrolling in any course at an institution outside the United States unless the institution is an approved institution of higher learning and the course is approved by the Secretary. (Sec. 6) Provides for the conditional approval of correspondence courses as courses for which veterans' educational assistance may be provided. (Sec. 7) Increases from $12 million to $13 million the annual limit on the amount authorized to be provided to State and local educational agencies for furnishing courses of education to veterans under the educational assistance program. Removes an educational agency reporting requirement with respect to the provision of such services. (Sec. 9) Continues the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education through December 31, 2003. (Sec. 10) Increases from $5 million to $6 million the annual funding ceiling for veterans' educational and vocational counseling services obtained by the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Sec. 11) Amends the Service Members Occupational Conversion and Training Act of 1992 to: (1) repeal the 18-month limit on training under such Act for employment in stable and permanent positions; (2) revise certain certification requirements under such training program; (3) allow assistance to be paid on behalf of eligible persons for training under two or more training programs if the per-person annual training limit is not exceeded; and (4) allow a person to enter into a job training program on the day that official employer notification is given (currently, the person must wait two weeks after such notification)."
