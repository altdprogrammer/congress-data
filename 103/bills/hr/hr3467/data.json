Requires that the Fund: (1) consist only of amounts equal to the net deficit reduction estimated to result from the Act; and (2) be used exclusively for health care reform. Excludes amounts in the Fund that result from the net total of direct spending and receipts provisions calculated according to provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 from the totals under other provisions of that Act. Amends Federal law to require inclusion in the President's budget of Fund information and amounts."
