    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. economic cooperation projects in China or Tibet should adhere to specified principles, including to: (1) suspend the use of merchandise manufactured by convict or forced labor; (2) seek to ensure political and religious freedom without fear of one's employment status; (3) ensure that methods of production do not pose a danger to project employees and the surrounding environment; (4) strive to use business enterprises that are not controlled by China; and (5) promote specified freedoms in China. Requires the Secretary of State to forward a copy of such principles to member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and encourage them to promote such principles. Requires each U.S. parent company conducting an economic cooperation project in China or Tibet to register with the Secretary and indicate whether they agree to implement such principles. Sets forth specified reporting requirements. Authorizes Federal agencies to intercede with a foreign government or national regarding export marketing activity in China or Tibet on behalf of such a parent company only if such company adheres to such principles."
