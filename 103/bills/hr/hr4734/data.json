(Sec. 4) Directs the USTR to prepare an environmental assessment for each free trade agreement. (Sec. 5) Directs the USTR to: (1) consider the results of such consultations with respect to a major trade action before formulating any negotiating position for such action; and (2) review such negotiating position and determine its compatibility with U.S. laws that protect environmental resources or encourage sustainable development. (Sec. 6) Directs the Council on Environmental Quality: (1) to monitor the effects of major trade actions on environmental resources within the United States; and (2) together with the Secretary of State to cooperate with other nations to monitor and determine the effects of such actions on such resources outside the United States. Requires the Council to report every three years to the Congress on the results of such monitoring."
