    "text": "Coeur d'Alene Basin and Spokane River Restoration Act of 1994 - Establishes the Coeur d'Alene Basin Restoration Corporation and the Coeur d'Alene Basin Advisory Committee. Directs the Board of the Corporation to adopt a Basin Restoration Plan for the Coeur d'Alene Basin, Idaho, and the Spokane River, Idaho and Washington State. Requires the Plan to: (1) identify all sources of mining waste and other discharges into the Basin and River; (2) inventory existing projects and activities to restore, remediate, or prevent damages from mining waste and other pollution; and (3) identify additional projects needed to carry out such activities. Preempts any conflicting Federal, State, or local laws. Exempts the Corporation from liability for the costs of removing or remediating releases of hazardous materials, including liability under provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund) Prohibits a project from proceeding until the Board determines that the project meets all requirements under Federal, or more stringent State and tribal, environmental laws. Funds the Corporation's activities through congressional appropriations and private contributions from companies that have been involved with mining activities in the Basin. Establishes the Coeur d'Alene Basin Restoration Fund. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the intent of the Congress that the mining companies of the Basin that contributed to the release of hazardous materials should: (1) contribute a fair portion of the cost of restoring natural resources; and (2) upon payment of a fair contribution, be assured that no further liability for response costs or natural resource damages may be imposed upon them. Deems such companies to have satisfied liability that may otherwise be imposed by CERCLA if they contribute at least 25 percent of the amount appropriated by the Congress to carry out this Act. Grants such companies an offset against liabilities if they contribute less than the required amount. Authorizes the Corporation, the State of Idaho, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, and the United States to pursue all actions under CERCLA unless the companies satisfy their liabilities regardless of whether the Basin Restoration Plan is implemented. Tolls all statutes of limitation for cost recovery and natural resource damage actions against the mining companies until January 1, 2018."
