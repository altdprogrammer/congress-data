    "text": "Military Land Reform and Reassessment Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to permit: (1) the military department of any State (currently, limited to Federal departments and agencies) to use, occupy, and develop public lands, subject to specified requirements; and (2) the use of public lands within the State by the military department of one or more States for military training, equipment testing, or other authorized military activities. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) issue a general authorization for the military department of one or more States to use public lands for activities the Secretary finds are not likely to result in a significant degree of residual contamination of affected lands; (2) permit such use for activities that would result in a significant degree of residual contamination under specified circumstances; and (3) waive rental charges for the use of public land by a State military department for military training, equipment testing, and other authorized military activities. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) reporting requirements; and (2) reimbursement by the Secretary of Defense of a State military department for costs to such department incident to the use of lands by a State National Guard or by U.S. armed forces for specified purposes. Revises provisions with respect to authority over the interchange of lands. Sets forth provisions regarding the monitoring of, effect of, and restrictions on military aircraft overflights over nonmilitary public lands and lands managed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Defense to submit to the Congress an inventory of all public lands withdrawn for military purposes. Requires each future-years defense plan to include an identification of public lands whose withdrawal under the Engle Act is expected to be requested during the years covered by such plan. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the termination of military uses of withdrawn public lands; and (2) restrictions on use for military purposes of lands in the Orchard training area, Idaho."
