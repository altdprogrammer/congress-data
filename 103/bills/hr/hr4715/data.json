Revises such provisions to: (1) authorize the appropriate Secretary to convey such lands by patent, if appropriate; (2) increase the maximum value of lands that may be so conveyed to $250,000; (3) provide for conveyance of parcels of 40 acres or less (currently, ten acres or less) subject to specified encroachment, or of tracts of parcels of any size involving adjacent parcels subject to similar encroachment; (4) authorize conveyances of qualified tracts of lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails System, national monuments, or national recreation areas by cash sale only, at fair market value, with the proceeds to be accumulated into a restricted fund for purchase of additional private lands within or adjacent to such special areas; and (5) authorize boundary adjustments within such specially designated areas in order to resolve encroachments which existed before the time of designation."
