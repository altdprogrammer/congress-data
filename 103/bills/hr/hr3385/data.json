    "text": "International Counterfeiting Deterrence Act of 1993 - Establishes the International Counterfeiting Deterrence Strike Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, to study: (1) means for international coordination and cooperation to combat counterfeiting, including international agreements; (2) available technological devices and methods to enhance detection and enforcement; and (3) the usage of U.S. currency overseas and the correlation of such uses with counterfeiting. Establishes the Currency Design Commission and empowers it to redesign U.S. currency for counterfeit deterrence purposes. Charges the Director of the U.S. Secret Service with establishing a team of experts to assist and provide training to foreign government entities with respect to counterfeit detection, investigation, and prosecution activities. Directs the Chairperson of the Strike Force to: (1) seek to enter into negotiations with officials of foreign countries in which a significant amount of U.S. currency is counterfeited; and (2) report to certain congressional committees. Cites circumstances under which the President may proscribe any transfer of funds between persons in the United States and those of a foreign country in which significant amounts of U.S. currency is counterfeited. Amends Federal criminal law to establish penalties, including imprisonment, for counterfeiting U.S. currency abroad. Directs the Strike Force to recommend to the President and the Congress sanctions against State-supported counterfeiting. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Export-Import Bank from engaging in any credit activity with a country determined by the President to be involved in State-supported counterfeiting. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to set license requirements for countries involved in State-supported counterfeiting. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit Federal assistance to a country determined by the President to be involved in State-supported counterfeiting."
