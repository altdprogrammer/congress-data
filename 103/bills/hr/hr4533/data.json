    "text": "National Park Service Entrepreneurial Management Reform Act of 1994 - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to increase fees for admission to units of the National Park System (NPS) and other specified areas. Makes receipts from admission available, subject to appropriation, for authorized resource protection, rehabilitation, and conservation projects. (Sec. 2) Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a pilot project at Yosemite National Park that utilizes incentives, including waiving or reducing admission fees, to encourage use of public transit which serves the purpose of reducing vehicular traffic within such park. Revises provisions regarding the issuance of lifetime admission permits, including a limitation that such a permit entitles only the permittee and the accompanying spouse to free admission. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress respecting areas where the Secretary determines that admission fees would be appropriate but where such fees are prohibited by law, and areas where such fees are authorized but not being collected. Increases the penalty for violations of rules and regulations regarding admission and special recreation use fees. Modifies provisions regarding the use of fees collected. Requires that specified receipts be covered into a special National Park Renewal Fund. Makes such funds available for resource protection, research, interpretation, and maintenance activities related to resource protection and visitor enjoyment in areas managed by the National Park Service. Repeals a requirement that qualified public or private entities selling annual admission permits reimburse the United States for the full amount to be received from the sale of such permits when or before the agency delivers the permits to such entity for sale. Directs the Secretary to establish reasonable fees for nonrecreational uses of NPS units that require special arrangements. Prohibits charging an admission or recreation use fee for entrance into, or use of, any federally owned area operated and maintained by a Federal agency which is used for outdoor recreation purposes, except as provided for by such Act. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) negotiate and enter into agreements with State or local governments, individuals, or other entities for the purpose of sharing costs or services in carrying out authorized functions and responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to NPS units; and (2) provide, subject to appropriation, the Federal funding share from any funds available to the National Park Service in carrying out such agreements. (Sec. 4) Requires any funds payable to the United States as restitution for damages to national park resources or property to be paid to the Secretary and made available for improvement, protection, or rehabilitation of damaged resources or property."
