    "text": "Rapid Deployment Strike Force Act - Directs the Attorney General to establish in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) a Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) to assist units of local government in combating crime. Provides that: (1) the RDF shall be headed by a Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI and comprised of approximately 2,500 Federal law enforcement officers with training and experience in the investigation of violent and drug-related crime, criminal gangs, and juvenile delinquency and community action to prevent crime; and (2) to the extent that the RDF is staffed through the transfer of personnel from other entities in the Department of Justice or any other Federal agency, such personnel shall be replaced through the hiring of additional law enforcement officers. Authorizes the Deputy Assistant Director, on application of the Governor of a State and the chief executive officer of the affected local government (or, in the case of the District of Columbia, the mayor), and upon finding that the occurrence of criminal activity in a particular jurisdiction is being exacerbated by the interstate flow of drugs, guns, and criminals, to deploy on a temporary basis an RDF unit to the jurisdiction to assist State and local law enforcement agencies in the investigation of criminal activity. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) applications for assistance; (2) conditions of deployment; and (3) deputization of RDF members. Directs the Attorney General to establish and administer an annual leave system applicable to the Federal law enforcement officers serving in the RDF. Requires that: (1) RDF units be based in the Nation's major regions at locations and in facilities determined by the Attorney General; (2) RDF members receive training and education in the regional crime problems of the region where they are based; and (3) the Deputy Assistant Director, whenever possible, deploy units in the region where they are based. Provides for the use of the RDF, when not deployed, to provide training and education to local law enforcement agencies and to support Federal law enforcement efforts."
