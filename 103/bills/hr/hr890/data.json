Requires the FDIC to transfer, within 18 months after beginning to pay off depositors, any unclaimed deposits to the State of a depositor's last known address (or, if the address is outside the United States, to the State in which the failed institution had its main office). Permits an insured depositor to claim from the FDIC after the 18-month period any deposit a State has refused to accept, but only until the receivership is terminated. Permits States to keep an unclaimed deposit for ten years, after which, if remaining unclaimed, it must refund the deposit to the FDIC. Makes a specified rule for receiverships in progress before the enactment of this Act."
