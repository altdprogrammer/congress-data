Title I: Derivatives Dealers - Sets forth: (1) registration and notice requirements for derivatives broker/dealers and material associated persons of such broker/dealers; (2) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rulemaking authority over derivatives dealers; and (3) membership requirements in a registered securities association for derivatives dealers. Title II: Broker-Dealer Oversight Reforms - Authorizes national securities exchanges and registered securities associations to prescribe internal rules and enforcement guidelines for members engaged in derivatives transactions and for material associated persons. Requires SEC financial responsibility rules to include maintenance of sufficient capital levels taking into account selected activities of any registered derivatives dealer that is a material associated person of a broker or dealer. Includes within SEC risk assessment guidelines the derivatives transactions of government and municipal securities broker/dealers, and of registered broker/dealers."
