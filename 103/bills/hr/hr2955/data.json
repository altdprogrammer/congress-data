    "text": "Business and Consumer Lending Stimulus Act - Prohibits Federal banking regulatory agencies from imposing or enforcing for a specified period any leverage limit for an adequately capitalized insured depository institution requiring a ratio of tangible equity to total assets greater than three percent. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require Federal banking regulatory agencies to: (1) consider, when prescribing real estate lending standards, their impact upon the availability of credit for certain target groups; and (2) minimize any negative impact. Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to direct the Appraisal Subcommittee to encourage the States to enter into reciprocity agreements with sister States allowing licensed appraisers in one State to perform appraisals in other States. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to certain congressional committees on the effect of risk based capital standards upon insured depository institutions, the availability of credit, and the domestic economy. Requires Federal banking regulatory agencies and the National Credit Union Administration to establish an independent appellate process within each agency to review regulatory determinations. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) to study and report to the Congress on the effect of sterile reserves. Directs the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to study and report to the Congress on the budgetary impact of the payment of interest on sterile reserves. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to cite circumstances under which the Resolution Trust Corporation may waive its rights to repudiate an agreement to sell credit card accounts receivable. Requires Federal banking regulatory agencies to coordinate examinations conducted at an insured depository institution with Federal and State sister agencies so as to minimize the disruptive effects upon the institution's operations. Directs the Board and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to jointly study and report to the Congress on ways to streamline the credit-granting process. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 to increase the number and kinds of disclosures required of insured depository institutions with respect to loans made to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and start-up enterprises. Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to treat as a bank, for certain purposes of the Federal Reserve Act, a savings association that is well capitalized without including goodwill in calculating its core capital (thus accelerating the effective date of the sister thrift exemption for well-capitalized institutions)."
