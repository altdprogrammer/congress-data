Bases the tax on the weight of the unprocessed fish and makes the owner or operator of the vessel liable for the tax. Establishes a Pacific Whiting Fisheries Research Trust Fund for expenditures for habitat restoration, restoration and rebuilding of fisheries and fishing stock, and by-catch gear selectivity and reduction research. Appropriates taxes imposed by this Act to such Fund."
