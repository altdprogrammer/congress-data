    "text": "Arson Prevention Act of 1994 - Amends the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to direct the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration, acting through the Office of Fire Prevention and Arson Control, to carry out a demonstration program under which not more than ten grant awards shall be made to States or consortia of States (States) for programs relating to arson research, prevention, and control. Directs the Administrator, in carrying out such provision, to award two-year grants on a competitive, merit basis to States for projects that promote one or more of specified goals, including: (1) improving the training by States leading to professional certification of arson investigators; (2) providing resources for the formation of arson task forces or interagency organizational arrangements involving the police and fire departments and other relevant local agencies; (3) combating fraud as a cause of arson and advancing research at the State and local levels on the significance and prevention of fraud as a motive for setting fires; (4) combating juvenile arson, drug-related arson, and domestic violence as a cause of arson; and (5) improving the capability of firefighters to identify and combat arson through expanded training programs. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the structuring of applications; (2) State qualification criteria; (3) the extension of grants; (4) technical assistance; (5) consultation and cooperation with other Federal agencies; (6) assessment; and (7) the purchase of American made equipment and products by grant recipients. (Sec. 4) Includes within a provision requiring the Administrator to provide training and instructional materials in skills and knowledge necessary to assist Federal, State, and local fire service and law enforcement personnel in arson prevention, detection, and control, a requirement that particular emphasis be placed on the needs of volunteer firefighters for improved and more widely available arson training courses. (Sec. 5) Prohibits making certain funds available to a State or local government under the Act unless such government has a policy to actively promote the training of its firefighters in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (Sec. 6) Exempts Federal employee housing that does not have an adequate and reliable electrical system from the requirement for protection by hard-wired (but requires battery operated) smoke detectors. (Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations, including appropriations for basic research on the development of an advanced course on arson prevention and for the expansion of arson investigator training programs at the National Fire Academy and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center or through regional delivery sites. (Sec. 8) Prohibits any funds from being authorized to be appropriated for any fiscal year after FY 1996 for carrying out the programs for which funds are authorized by this Act or the amendments made by this Act."
