Authorizes the Secretary to submit for approval to specified congressional committees proposed modifications to the NHS. Specifies that a modification may only take effect if a law has been enacted approving such modification. Requires the Secretary to submit proposed modifications, including a list and description of additions to the NHS consisting of: (1) connections to major ports, airports, international border crossings, public transportation and transit facilities, interstate bus terminals, rail, and other intermodal transportation facilities; and (2) any Congressional High Priority Corridor or any segment thereof established by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) which was not identified on the designated NHS, subject to the completion of feasibility studies. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress a proposal for a comprehensive National Transportation System using the NHS as the backbone for establishing such System. (Sec. 102) Freezes funding allocations under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program at the FY 1994 levels for the remaining three years of ISTEA. Authorizes a State to obligate funds apportioned to it for such programs only for specified transportation projects or programs determined by the Secretary to be likely to contribute to the attainment of a national ambient air quality standard (as under current law) or maintenance, subject to specified requirements. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to establish a program to require States to conduct an analysis of the life-cycle costs of, and carry out a value engineering analysis for, all projects on the NHS. Requires the Secretary to permit a State highway department, in accordance with standards developed by the Secretary, to include a clause in a contract for the construction of any Federal-aid highway project requiring the contract to warrant the materials and work performed. (Sec. 104) Requires that: (1) contracts or subcontracts for engineering and design services be performed and audited in compliance with cost principles contained in Federal acquisition regulations; and (2) the recipients of Federal funds accept indirect cost rates established in accordance with such regulations for one year applicable accounting periods by a Government agency or independent certified public accountant if such rates are not currently under dispute.

Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) placing apportionments withheld from a State by the Secretary in escrow pending satisfaction of minimum utilization requirements; (2) a sunset provision for availability of such apportionments; and (3) exemption from certain requirements where a State has implemented a documented waste tire abatement program that will result in the elimination of tire stockpiles by 1997. Authorizes a State for any year to meet up to half of the minimum utilization requirement by using an equivalent amount of recycled rubber for alternative applications, other than making asphalt pavement, if the State certifies that such alternative application does not present a threat to safety, human health, or the environment and it is demonstrated that such applications provide equal or enhanced engineering benefits.
