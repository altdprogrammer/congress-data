  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1994-10-06", 
    "text": "A Living Wage, Jobs for All Act - Declares that the Congress affirms the basic economic rights and responsibilities under the 1944 \"Economic Bill of Rights\", while updating and extending it to include that: (1) every adult American able and willing to earn a living through paid work has the right to a free choice among opportunities for useful and productive part- or full-time paid employment at decent real wages or for self-employment; and (2) every adult American unable to work for pay or find employment has the right to an adequate standard of living that rises with increases in the wealth and productivity of the society. (Sec. 2) Makes it the responsibility of each Federal agency and commission, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to perform so as to help establish and maintain conditions under which all adult Americans may freely exercise the economic rights specified in 1944 and in this Act. Prohibits Federal agencies or commissions from directly or indirectly promoting recession, stagnation, or unemployment as a means of reducing wages and salaries or inflation. (Sec. 3) Directs the President to establish a program to implement such basic economic rights and responsibilities. Sets forth policies and projects to be included under such program. Includes such program in the annual submission of budget. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to provide grants and other incentives to States and local governments to encourage short- and long-term public works and public services planning in urban, suburban, and rural areas, in order to implement such basic economic rights and responsibilities. Requires applications for such assistance to include strategic and tactical plans. (Sec. 5) Makes it the policy of the Federal government to cooperate with other nations' governments and the United Nations to help develop an international community based on rising living standards, particularly for those people with the lowest levels of income, wealth, access to public facilities, free trade union organization, and political power. Directs the President, through appropriate Federal agencies, to review all Federal law and regulations that interfere with implementation of such policy, taking specified factors into consideration. Makes U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development contingent upon development and implementation of policies and procedures that will: (1) raise the standard of living in countries receiving assistance from such Fund or Bank, rather than impose austerity; and (2) contribute to such countries' economic viability, credit worthiness, and ability to import goods and services from the United States. Directs the President to: (1) instruct the U.S. representative to the United Nations to propose a series of international and regional conferences on alternative methods of planning for the reduction of involuntary unemployment; and (2) promote, through the Secretary of Labor, the convening in the United States or elsewhere of international and regional conferences on coping with unemployment and underemployment and moving toward fuller employment in the world. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in promoting such conferences, to provide financial and technical assistance to organized labor and cooperative, community, nonprofit, and voluntary organizations, giving priority to widespread communication on controlling facility closings and capital flight by large businesses and on facilitating transnational labor organizations and collective bargaining. (Sec. 6) Directs the President, in the next annual message to the Congress, to propose establishment of a Conversion Planning Fund. Requires such Fund to promote and activate short- and long-term plans for coping with declines in civilian or military activities by developing policies, programs, and projects to expand economic activities in sectors where additional or improved goods or services are needed. Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer one percent of amounts appropriated for military activities of the Department of Defense to the Fund. Authorizes appropriations, in addition to such transferred funds, as necessary for the Fund. (Sec. 7) Directs the President to establish an annual schedule for implementing this Act, including specified recommendations for restructuring Federal budget priorities and promoting educational activities within each State on locally-based overall planning. Amends the Employment Act of 1946 to: (1) include such implementation schedule in the annual Presidential economic report; and (2) provide for Joint Economic Committee oversight of actions taken or proposed to be taken under this Act. Sets forth requirements that specified types of impact analyses and other information be contained in: (1) all budgetary data for specific programs, whether in budget messages and resolutions or in legislative authorizations and appropriations; and (2) all Presidential budget messages to the Congress. (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations."
