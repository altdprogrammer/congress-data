    "text": "Interstate Commerce Commission Sunset Act - Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to terminate, as of October 1, 1994, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) as an independent executive agency of the U.S. Government. Transfers to the Secretary of Transportation the functions, powers, and duties of the ICC relating to the regulation of rail transportation and to certain other surface transportation regulation. Prohibits any State or its political subdivision or any interstate or other political agency of two or more States from enacting or enforcing any law, rule, or standard relating to interstate or intrastate rates, routes, or services of motor carriers, motor private carriers, water carriers, freight forwarders, or transportation brokers. Authorizes the President to take specified action upon a determination that the government of a contiguous foreign country has engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or restrictive practices having a substantial adverse competitive impact upon certain U.S. transportation companies. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to the Congress, two years from the effective date of this Act, a status report and evaluation concerning the implementation of the National Governors' Association Consensus Agenda on standards for uniform State regulation of interstate motor carriers. Transfers to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jurisdiction over certain motor carriers, water carriers, freight forwarders, and railroad passenger carriers. Grants to the FTC the exclusive power to enforce certain regulations governing the transport of household goods."
