Specifies that no benefits shall be provided to any individual confined in a correctional facility pursuant to that individual's conviction of a felony offense, except that the Secretary of Labor may pay a specified percentage of the benefits to such individual's dependents. Requires a Federal, State, or local agency to make the name and social security account number of any individual who is confined in a correctional facility under the agency's jurisdiction pursuant to the individual's conviction of felony offense available to the Secretary upon request to carry out provisions of the Act. Revises provisions of the Federal criminal code to provide that whoever knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact or makes or knowingly uses a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the application for or receipt of Federal employees' compensation shall be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 and/or up to five years' imprisonment."
