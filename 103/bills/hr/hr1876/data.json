Provides that implementing bills involving tariff and nontariff trade agreements shall be effective only if, among other things, the President, at least 120 calendar days (currently, 90 days) before he enters into such agreement, notifies the Congress of his intention to enter into it, and publishes such intention in the Federal Register. Extends congressional \"fast track procedures\" to such implementing bills through April 16, 1994. Requires specified advisory committee reports regarding such agreements to be provided to the President, the Congress, and the United States Trade Representative no later than 30 days after the President notifies the Congress of his intention to enter into the agreement, but before January 15, 1994."
