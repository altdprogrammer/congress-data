Amends SSA title IV part F (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program) to tie revised work supplementation and community work experience programs under such part to the new State programs established above under SSA title IV part A. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to allow States to elect to subsidize jobs for work supplementation program participants out of funds that would otherwise be payable as food stamp benefits. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to pay such States amounts equal to such food stamp benefits. Title II: Expanded State Waiver Authority - Establishes an Interagency Waiver Request Board in order to provide a focal point within the Federal Government for the development and coordination of requests to waive specified provisions of various social welfare statutes to improve opportunities for low-income individuals and families to achieve self-sufficiency. Title III: Miscellaneous Amendments - Amends SSA title IV part A to: (1) require AFDC recipients addicted to alcohol or drugs to undergo appropriate treatment as a condition of receiving AFDC; and (2) change AFDC rules for disregarding earned income."
