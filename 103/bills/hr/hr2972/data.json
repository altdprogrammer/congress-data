Restricts such a bank's loans and investments to provide a reasonable economic return to the bank and its shareholders consistent with its primary community development purpose. Mandates: (1) such bank's coordination with certain Federal agencies regarding its community development activities; and (2) an annual onsite examination to evaluate its compliance with this Act and its record of meeting community credit needs. Title II: Conforming Amendments - Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to: (1) authorize the National Credit Union Administration Board (the Board) to provide technical assistance to community development credit unions by using the interest earned from authorized investments in Treasury securities; and (2) direct the Board to study and report to certain congressional committees on regulatory and legislative changes that may be necessary to ensure the viability and productivity of community development activities by credit unions."
