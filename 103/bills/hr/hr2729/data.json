    "text": "Congressional Accountability Act - Makes any provision of Federal law applicable to the House of Representatives and to the Senate to the extent that it relates to: (1) the terms and conditions of employment (including hiring, promotion or demotion, salary and wages, overtime compensation, benefits, work assignments or reassignments, termination, and family and medical leave) of employees; (2) protection from discrimination in personnel actions, including discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including marital and parental status), or national origin within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, age within the meaning of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, or handicap or disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; (3) the health and safety of employees; or (4) the availability of information to the public. Establishes in the legislative branch an Office of Compliance to study and report to the Congress on the application of such laws. Sets forth provisions relating to congressional procedures for approval of Office regulations. Requires the Board of Directors of the Office to carry out an information program to acquaint Members of the House, Senators, and congressional employees with the provisions, including remedies, of the laws applicable to the Congress under this Act. Requires the procedure for consideration of alleged violations of such laws to consist of the following steps: (1) counseling; (2) mediation; (3) formal complaint and hearing by a hearing board; and (4) judicial review of a hearing board's decision. Declares that any intimidation of, or reprisal against, any employee because of the exercise of a right under this Act constitutes an unlawful employment practice that may be remedied in the same manner under this Act as is a violation of a law made applicable to the Congress. Requires the records and decisions of hearing boards and the decisions of the Select Committee on Ethics to be made public if required for judicial review. Limits a congressional employee to the judicial proceeding provided by this Act to redress prohibited practices."
