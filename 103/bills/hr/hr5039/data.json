Provides for similar requirements for receiving assistance under the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program. Requires AFDC to be provided to the parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative on behalf of the unmarried minor and any of the minor's dependent children. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make matching grants to any Home for Single Dependent Minor Parents in which a qualified minor is living. Requires certain welfare benefits for minors living in Homes for Single Dependent Minor Parents to be provided in the form of payments to such entities. Denies AFDC and Federal rental housing assistance to drug addicts and alcoholics who do not undergo appropriate treatment for their substance abuse. Requires pregnant women under age 19 who are on Medicaid and addicted to drugs or alcohol to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of any treatment the woman is receiving for such condition, and with State imposed requirements for monitoring and testing to ensure the individual's compliance with treatment requirements. Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 with regard to Homes for Single Dependent Minor Parents. Title II: Rehabilitation Grants for Housing and Services Facilities - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to carry out a program to provide assistance to eligible nonprofit entities for rehabilitation of existing structures for use as facilities to provide housing and services to pregnant women and to single dependent minor parents and their children. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible nonprofit entities to rehabilitate existing structures for use as housing and services facilities for pregnant women and for single dependent minor parents and their children."
