Requires the Secretary of the Interior to finalize a new comprehensive management plan for the Area by January 1, 1996, and to review and revise it at least once every five years thereafter. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, to establish a visitors center to interpret the history and geological, ecological, natural, cultural, and other resources of the Area and the biology of the raptors and their relationships to man. Authorizes the Secretary to permit visitor use of the public lands in the Area in a manner that is consistent with this Act. Permits continued use of the Area's Orchard Training Area by the Idaho National Guard for up to five years pending completion of research concerning military use of such lands. Authorizes the continued grazing of domestic livestock within such Area. Requires the Secretary to study, identify, and, where appropriate, initiate land exchanges to resolve ownership conflicts within the Area. Releases lands within the Snake River Birds of Prey National Area that have been found unsuitable for wilderness designation from further management pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Authorizes appropriations."
