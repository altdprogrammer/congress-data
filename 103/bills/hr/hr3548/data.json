Requires the Secretary to pay specified amounts of surcharges received from coin sales to: (1) the Secretary of the Interior for construction of the Andersonville Prisoner-of-War Museum in Andersonville, Georgia; (2) an endowment fund to be established by this Act for the maintenance of the Museum; (3) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to maintain national cemeteries; (4) the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to help raise an endowment for the Memorial's maintenance and for the addition of names; and (5) the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation, Inc., to create, endow, and dedicate the Women in Military Service for America Memorial. Title III: Reform of Commemorative Coin Programs - Declares that specified congressional committees should not report or otherwise clear legislation for consideration by the House of Representatives or the Senate that provides more than two commemorative coin programs for any year, unless the committees determine, on the basis of a recommendation by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee, that extraordinary merit exists for an additional commemorative coin program. Requires: (1) recipients of commemorative coin surcharges to file quarterly and final expenditure reports with the Director of the United States Mint and the Comptroller General; and (2) the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on the payment and expenditure of any surcharges based on such reports."
