Authorizes the Secretary to make loans for joint ventures. Establishes loan preference criteria, limitations, and repayment terms. Prohibits: (1) loans to a joint venture if, as a result of the joint venture, a U.S. small business would transfer any business activity that it has been carrying out to a location outside the United States; and (2) goods produced pursuant to a joint venture that receives a loan from being imported into the United States. Provides for a contract with a private entity for the establishment of a data base to facilitate joint ventures between U.S. and independent state small businesses. Authorizes appropriations."
