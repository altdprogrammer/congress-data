Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit issuance of either a construction permit or combined construction and operating license for a utilization facility used for the generation of electricity for commercial sale, unless: (1) there is in existence a federally licensed facility for the interim storage or permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel generated by the utilization facility; and (2) the Secretary has certified that the facility will have an adequate capacity to accept all such waste and spent nuclear fuel generated during its lifetime."
