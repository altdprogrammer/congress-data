Prohibits the sale or lease of defense articles or services by the U.S. Government to any country or international organization that is known to have sent letters to U.S. firms requesting compliance with, or soliciting information regarding compliance with, the secondary or tertiary (currently, primary or secondary) Arab League boycott unless the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the country or organization does not currently maintain such a policy or practice. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the pilot visa waiver program through FY 1995. Authorizes the Secretary of State to expend a specified amount from the Department of State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs appropriation for the purchase of real property for use by the Department of State for its Miami Regional Center. Establishes principles for Voice of America broadcasts. Amend the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to extend a provision which authorizes the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) to transfer funds between accounts during the second fiscal year of an appropriation cycle. Requires that significant consideration be given to foreign language competence in the evaluation, assignment, and promotion of Foreign Service officers of the Department of State, Agency for International Development, and USIA. Authorizes the USIA Director to administer au pair programs through FY 1995. Permits funds derived from the sale of real property assets of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Munich, Germany, to be expended to meet one-time costs associated with the consolidation of U.S. Government broadcasting activities."
