Authorizes the President to reduce such duty rate to the extent that China has made progress towards: (1) enforcing laws to provide effective natural resource protection and achieving effective pollution abatement and control standards to protect the air, water, and land, both domestically and internationally; and (2) adhering to internationally recognized worker rights. Prohibits any duty reduction from being less than that imposed on products from countries that receive nondiscriminatory treatment. Requires excess revenues to be deposited into the Treasury. Directs the President to report annually to the Congress with respect to China's progress toward reaching the above-mentioned goals and of any duty reductions implemented as a result of such progress."
