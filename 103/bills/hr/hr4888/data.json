    "text": "District of Columbia Government Revenue Bond Delegation Authority Act of 1994 - Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (the Act) to allow the District of Columbia Council to authorize the issuance of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations to borrow money to finance, undertakings by District agencies or authorities which operate pursuant to any enterprise fund and other qualified applicants in the areas of sports and entertainment complexes, parking and convention facilities, and elementary and secondary education facilities. Provides for the payment and securing of such bonds, notes, or obligations from available enterprise fund revenues and designated taxes. Authorizes the District Council to delegate to any agency or instrumentality of the District government its authority to issue taxable or tax-exempt revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations to borrow money to finance specified activities. Allows the issued revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations to create a security interest in certain District revenues, including but not limited to designated taxes, as additional security for their payment. Exempts such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations from the provision that requires prior congressional approval of amounts being obligated or expended by officers or employees of the District government. Provides that fees or revenues to secure revenue bonds shall not be considered as general obligations of the District for purposes of limitations on borrowing and spending by the District government. Permits any Act of the District Council authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds, general obligation notes, revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations to take effect on the date of enactment of such Act."
