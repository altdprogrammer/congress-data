    "text": "Emerging Telecommunications Technologies Act of 1993 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to require the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct, at least biannually, and to report to specified congressional committees, the FCC, and the Secretary of Commerce annually on, joint electromagnetic spectrum planning with respect to: (1) future spectrum requirements for public and private uses and the allocation actions to accommodate those uses; and (2) actions to promote the efficient use of the spectrum. Directs the Secretary to submit to the President and the Congress a report identifying bands of frequencies that: (1) are allocated on a primary basis for Government use and eligible for licensing pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act); (2) are not required for the present or identifiable future needs of the Government; (3) can be made available for use under the Act (other than for Government stations); (4) are most likely to have the greatest potential for productive uses and public benefits; and (5) will not result in excessive costs to the Government or losses of services or benefits to the public. Prohibits withdrawal of the assignment of frequencies to any Federal power agency. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress a report which makes a preliminary identification of reallocable bands of frequencies. Directs the Secretary to convene an advisory committee to assist in carrying out this Act. Directs the President, after receiving the final report, to: (1) withdraw the assignment to a Government station of any frequency which such report recommends for reallocation; (2) withdraw or limit the assignment to a Government station of any frequency which such report recommends be reallocated or made available for mixed use; (3) assign or reassign other frequencies to Government stations as necessary to adjust to such withdrawal or limitation of assignments; and (4) notify the FCC and the Congress of actions taken. Authorizes the President to substitute alternative frequencies in the interest of national defense, important governmental needs, public health or safety, or Federal financial considerations. Directs the FCC to submit to the President and the Congress a plan for the distribution of the reallocated frequency bands. Authorizes the President to reclaim reassigned frequencies for reassignment to Government stations. Authorizes appropriations."
