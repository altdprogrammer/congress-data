Gives preference to applications: (1) from States with demonstrated ability or commitment to computer-based technology education; and (2) describing projects serving school districts serving a large number or percentage of economically disadvantaged students. Requires such projects to: (1) be provided in a continuous four-year form to consecutive groups of students at the applicable grade levels; (2) be conducted in not more than seven public schools within the State; and (3) ensure each student in such classes participates and has access to a computer at school during the school year and at home during the school year and summer. Requires the use of grant funds to provide: (1) hardware and software components to all sites; and (2) training for classroom teachers as well as parents, administrators, and technical personnel.
