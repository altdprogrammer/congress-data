Requires the Secretary of State to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the effectiveness of the U.S. policy of sharing information produced by U.S. radar installations and military aircraft with governments in South America for purposes of identifying and disrupting controlled substances trafficking activities; and (2) any adverse implications that such policy may have on U.S. national security interests."
