Requires a State to provide assurances that the average amount the State intends to expend per family for such emergency assistance for the fiscal year would not exceed such average amount for the immediately preceding fiscal year. Encourages the States to combine funds available for such purposes under the AFDC program with funds available under other Federal, State, or local programs, including the Community Development Block Grant program, the Home Investment Partnership program, and the programs under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act."
