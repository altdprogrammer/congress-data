    "text": "Economic and Employment Impact Act - Directs the Comptroller General to prepare an economic and employment impact statement to accompany each bill, resolution, or conference report before it may be reported or otherwise considered on the floor of either House. Requires such statement to: (1) state the extent to which enactment of such legislation would result in increased costs to the private sector, individuals, or State and local governments; and (2) include a detailed assessment of the annual impact of such legislation on consumer and business costs, employment, the Gross Domestic Product, and other specified criteria. Provides that such statement may consist of a brief summary assessment if preliminary analysis indicates that the aggregate effect of the legislation is less than $100 million or 10,000 jobs in national employment. Provides for waivers from such requirements under certain national security emergency conditions. Provides that it shall not be in order in either House to consider any legislation that does not include such a statement. Allows a point of order under this rule to be waived. Requires each regulation and proposed regulation promulgated by an executive department or agency to be accompanied by such a statement and published with it in the Federal Register."
