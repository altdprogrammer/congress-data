Requires the Director of such Office to report annually on the programs and activities assisted under the Women's Educational Equity Act. Women's Educational Equity Act of 1993 - Amends the Women's Educational Equity Act (part A of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) to reauthorize and revise grant programs to encourage gender equity throughout the educational system, including grants for model equity programs, local implementation, and research and development. Gives the Director of the Office of Women's Equity specified responsibilities under such Act. Extends the authorization of appropriations. Title II: Gender Equity in Elementary and Secondary Education - Subtitle A: Teacher Equity Training - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish gender equity requirements and training programs for teachers and other educational personnel (or parents) with respect to: (1) basic program requirements (under chapter 1 of title I for educationally disadvantaged children), innovative projects, schoolwide projects, parental involvement, and program improvement; (2) use of Even Start program funds; (3) secondary school programs (for basic skills improvement and dropout prevention and reentry); (4) local targeted assistance programs (under chapter 2 educational improvement partnership); (5) Eisenhower Mathematics and Science program school teacher training and national programs; (6) Women's Educational Equity personnel training and career education programs; (7) gifted and talented students personnel training; and (8) computer-based instruction personnel training under the Secretary's fund for innovation in education. Subtitle B: Gender Equity in Math and Science - Amends ESEA to revise the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education program with respect to: (1) grants to higher education institutions for elementary and secondary mathematics and science programs of school teacher training in gender-equitable instruction, targeted intervention and followup to encourage historically underserved students, and community-based informal education for historically underserved and underrepresented students; and (2) national model program grant priority for gender equity in computer use and teaching practices. Subtitle C: Dropout Prevention for Pregnant and Parenting Teens - Amends ESEA with respect to pregnant teenagers, teenage parents, and the children of such teenagers under various programs, including: (1) Even Start programs; (2) secondary school programs for basic skills improvement and dropout prevention and reentry; (3) local targeted assistance programs; (4) State and local drug abuse education and prevention programs; (5) assistance to address school dropout problems; and (6) assistance to provide basic skills improvement. Subtitle D: Schools Free from Sexual Harassment and Abuse - Amends ESEA to make an environment free from sexual harassment and abuse a distinguishing feature of effective schools. Adds programs to address sexual harassment and violence as part of efforts to ensure that educational institutions are free from threats to student and employee safety (among programs which may be receive Women's Educational Equity assistance). Includes the areas of sexual harassment and assault among those for which grants for comprehensive school health education may be used. Subtitle E: Link-up for Learning - Establishes a program of three-year grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) in partnership with other eligible entities for up to 80 percent of the costs of coordinated educational and other student support services for at-risk youth. Makes eligible for such a grant: (1) an LEA that seeks to plan and implement a coordinated services program for at-risk students with at least one other cooperating public agency; and (2) a consortium, including at least one LEA and one cooperating public service agency, formed to coordinate support services for at-risk students. Allows nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and private enterprises with special experience or expertise to participate as cooperating agencies. Establishes a Federal Interagency Task Force to identify means to facilitate interagency collaboration at Federal, State, and local levels to improve support services for at-risk students. Directs the Secretary of Education to study and report to the Congress on regulatory and legislative obstacles to coordinated support services and innovative procedures and programs. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle F: Child Abuse Education and Prevention - Amends ESEA to direct the Secretary of Education to use specified funds to carry out programs for child abuse education and prevention curriculum development and teacher training, including a demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle G: Data Collection - Amends ESEA to revise various data collection provisions to require collection, cross-tabulation, and reporting by sex within race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status (with respect to schoolwide projects, program improvement, secondary school programs, National Diffusion Network, evaluations and reporting, Eisenhower Mathematics and Science programs, State reports, assistance to address school dropout problems, and evaluations by the Secretary). Title III: Gender Equity in Higher Education - Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education to disclose gender participation rates and program support expenditures in college athletic programs to prospective students and, upon request, to the public. Directs the Secretary of Education to compile and publish annual reports of such data submitted by the institutions."
