Title II: Policy Coordination and Technology Programs - Subtitle A: Policy Coordination and Program Planning - Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to: (1) ensure the coordinated, interagency promotion of the research, development, and adoption of environmental technologies; and (2) develop priorities for Federal environmental technology research, development, and adoption efforts. (Sec. 202) Requires the Director to coordinate Federal activities and resources that are applied to life-cycle assessment in order to maximize the contribution of such assessments to sustainable economic development. (Sec. 203) Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to include goals for sustainable economic development within technology innovation programs. Includes such goals in other existing programs under specified Acts. Subtitle B: Environmental Technology - Establishes an Environmental Technologies Development and Integration Program, to be administered by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to promote the research, development, and integration of technologies that will contribute to sustainable economic development. Makes eligible for assistance projects that: (1) develop advanced, precommercial environmental technologies, with emphasis on technologies that will contribute to sustainable economic development; and (2) develop the integration of multiple steps in the conversion of materials that are involved in the manufacture, reuse, or recycling of a product, the recycling of process wastes, or the provision of a service. (Sec. 211) Prohibits intellectual property owned and developed by a business receiving financial assistance from being disclosed by the Federal Government except in accordance with an agreement.
