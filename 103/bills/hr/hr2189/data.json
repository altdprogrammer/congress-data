Provides for an additional 12-month extension of such exemption (but not beyond April 1, 1995) if the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that a State has made a good faith effort to comply with such Act. Bars exemption extensions for landfills: (1) at which total waste receipts exceed 100 tons daily on average over the term of the extension; (2) which accept wastes other than municipal solid waste; and (3) which have expanded laterally or which are not in compliance with liner standards."
