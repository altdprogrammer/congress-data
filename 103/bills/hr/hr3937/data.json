(Sec. 104) Specifies the kinds of export licenses the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) may require. Prohibits any person from exporting an item that such person knows will materially contribute to a program for the development of a weapon of mass destruction or missile in a country that is not a member of, or a cooperating country with respect to, an export control regime controlling such items. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a United States Commodity Control Index identifying all commodities and technology on which controls are imposed under this Act; (2) specify license requirements for such items; and (3) designate countries and end users to which exports of commodities and technology are controlled. Requires the Secretary to appoint export advisory committees with respect to export controls imposed on such items. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the President to prohibit or curtail the export of commodities or technology that would: (1) significantly enable a country or end user to acquire weapons of mass destruction; or (2) significantly contribute to the military capability of a country so as to prove detrimental to the national security of the United States or its allies. Requires the Secretary to establish a security control list of commodities, technology, countries, and end users with respect to which export controls are imposed by this Act. Requires the Secretaries of Defense and of Energy and the heads of other appropriate agencies to identify commodities and technology for inclusion on such list. Declares that the Secretary shall require authority to export commodities and technology on the security control list to a controlled country, a controlled end use, or a controlled end user. Sets forth provisions regarding the creation of multilateral export control regimes. Provides favorable licensing treatment for the export of commodities and technology among such regimes. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to request that a license be required for such exports if it is determined that the absence of an export license would prove detrimental to U.S. national security. Requires the Secretary periodically to review and remove export controls on computer equipment, computer communications and networking equipment, computer software, and related technology that has become obsolete. Requires the Secretary of State to propose the elimination of controls on mass-market computer equipment to export control regimes that control such equipment. Declares that, in specified circumstances, approval shall be presumed for a license for export to a country of any controlled goods, without regard to their technical specifications, for trade show purposes. Directs the Secretary to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering to study and report to the President and the Congress on the extent to which exports of computers can be controlled, and the policy reasons for maintaining controls. (Sec. 106) Authorizes the President to prohibit or curtail unilaterally the export of commodities or technology whenever it is essential to U.S. national security or foreign policy, or to encourage foreign countries not to support international terrorism. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of State to seek support from other countries and multilateral export control regimes for such controls. Prescribes the legislative procedure for extending controls. Prohibits export or reexport of controlled commodities or technology to countries that have repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism. Declares that crime control and detection instruments and equipment shall be approved for export by the Secretary only pursuant to an export license, with specified exceptions. Declares it to be U.S. policy to maintain, by unilateral controls and other specified means, its international leadership in restricting the export of sensitive dual use items and of munitions to rogue countries such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea. Requires the President to: (1) compile a list of such items and munitions; and (2) instruct the Secretary to require an individual validated license for the export of any listed item to any destination. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the President to prohibit or impose quantitative restrictions on the export of commodities that are domestically in short supply. Directs the Secretary to monitor exports, and contracts for exports, of commodities in cases where the volume of such commodities in relation to domestic supply contributes, or may contribute, to an increase in domestic prices or a domestic shortage, and such increase or shortage has, or may have, a serious adverse impact on the economy. Authorizes an entity, including a trade association, firm, or certified union or group of workers, that is representative of an industry that processes metallic materials capable of being recycled to petition the Secretary to monitor or impose export controls on such exports that are in short supply. Prohibits the export of Alaskan North Slope crude oil, with specified exceptions. Provides for licensing of refined petroleum product exports. Prohibits the imposition of quantitative restrictions based on short supply controls on agricultural commodities (including fats and oils or animal hides or skins) without the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture. Prohibits the exportation of unprocessed western red cedar (Thuja plicata) harvested from State or Federal lands. Declares that shipments of crude oil and refined and partially refined petroleum products for use by the Department of Defense or U.S.-supported installations shall not, for purposes of export controls on Alaskan North Slope oil, be considered to be exports. (Sec. 108) Directs the President to issue regulations that prohibit, with specified exceptions, U.S. persons from supporting any boycott imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States that is not itself the object of a U.S. boycott. (Sec. 109) Specifies procedures for the processing of export license applications, including screening, referral, approval or denial, and appeal of denials. Authorizes the Secretaries of Defense and of Energy to review any proposed export of controlled commodities or technology.
