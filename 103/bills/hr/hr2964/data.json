Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the sale of U.S.-made auto accessories in Japanese markets. Requires the Special Advisory Committee to take into account the barriers to sales in Japanese markets of U.S.-made auto parts and accessories manufactured by companies not affiliated with Japanese-owned or -controlled companies."
