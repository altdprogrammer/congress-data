Requires the denuclearization process to include: (1) a verifiable nuclear test ban agreement and a worldwide agreement to end production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for weapons purposes; (2) phasing out the use of such materials for civilian purposes; (3) strengthening international regimes to prevent countries from developing or assisting others to develop nuclear weapons and creating international mechanisms to enforce these regimes; (4) increased investment in research and development of nuclear safeguard and verification methods and technologies; and (5) phased reductions in the nuclear arsenals of the United States, the Russian Federation, China, the United Kingdom, France, and the nuclear threshold states."
