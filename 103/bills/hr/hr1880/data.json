Requires defense procurement specifications to encourage the use of commercially available systems, supplies, and services. Title II: Retraining Defense Workers for New Employment - Directs the Secretary to establish an Office of Training Oversight and Administration to coordinate and oversee retraining, placement, and other transition assistance for former employees of qualified defense contractors or former civilian DOD employees. Directs the Office to disseminate retraining and placement assistance information. Authorizes the Office to: (1) carry out a skills development program for retraining eligible defense workers in skills determined to be in short supply; and (2) award one- and two-year scholarships to assist such eligible defense workers to attend educational institutions. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Commercialization and Dual-Use Research Opportunities for Defense Contractors and Small Business - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to assist qualified defense contractors to participate in the Advanced Technology Program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other appropriate programs of the Department of Commerce to commercialize significant new scientific discoveries and technologies. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to encourage research proposals involving dual-use applications and proposals involving military to civilian conversion. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make loans to qualified defense contractors to carry out commercialization projects. Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) encourage the creation of industrial parks or technology incubator centers to transfer technology from defense contractors to small businesses; and (2) create and administer an awards program for redirection efforts by qualified defense contractors in the area of commercialization. Title IV: Fast Response State Technological Competitiveness Grants - Provides Federal grants to States for defense reinvestment programs which stress economic development, quality job growth, education and retraining, technology transfer and infrastructure, and enhanced competitiveness. Authorizes appropriations."
