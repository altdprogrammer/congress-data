Requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage such segments through cooperative agreements with appropriate political jurisdictions except that publicly-owned lands within the boundaries of the segments shall be managed by the agency having jurisdiction over them. Requires cooperative agreements for the management of the segments to provide for the long-term protection, preservation, and enhancement of the segments and to be consistent with the comprehensive management plan prepared by the Secretary and with the local river management plans prepared by appropriate local political jurisdictions in conjunction with the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to review compliance with the local river management plans biennially and to report to specified congressional committees on any deviation which may diminish the values for which the river segment was designated. Encourages the Secretary to work with municipalities to negotiate agreement for designating additional eligible segments of the Maurice River and its tributaries. Designates the eligible segments for study as potential additions to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system. Authorizes appropriations."
