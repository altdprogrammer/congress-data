Eisenhower Professional Development Program, to support professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers in core academic subjects and development of curricula aligned with State or local content and performance standards. (This replaces the current Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Education Act programs, but retains certain Federal activities such as the national clearinghouse for science, mathematics, and technology education materials.)
