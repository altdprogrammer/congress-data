Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to maintain U.S. military personnel and installations in such nations after FY 1995 unless the President certifies to the Congress that they have entered into revised agreements. Makes this Act inapplicable if the U.S. armed forces are actively engaged in armed conflict in Europe or the threat of imminent U.S. engagement in conflict in Europe exists."
