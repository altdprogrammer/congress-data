    "text": "Child Support Responsibility Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a national registry of all child support orders. Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require the States to have in effect statutorily prescribed procedures to ensure transmission to such registry of original and modified child support orders. Requires such registry to: (1) maintain abstracts of child support orders; and (2) report to employers whether an employee's legal obligation to provide child support is to be collected through wage withholding. Mandates that child support enforcement agencies have access to certain parent locator information networks. States that grants available to the States under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 shall be reduced for each State that fails to report child support warrants to designated State law enforcement agencies. Amends part D of SSA title IV to increase Federal financial participation for States with unified child support enforcement programs. Instructs the Secretary to establish a child support obligations reporting system for employees using the W-4 forms, according to prescribed guidelines. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prescribe guidelines for: (1) the collection of child support obligations at the source on wages; and (2) the collection of child support obligation through wage withholding. Directs the Secretary to distribute collected child support obligations to the relevant payee. Amends part D of SSA title IV to subject workers' compensation benefits to garnishment. Requires the States to have in effect, with respect to child support arrearages, statutorily prescribed procedures to: (1) place liens on certificates of vehicle titles; (2) attach bank accounts; (3) seize lottery winnings, settlements, payouts, awards, bequests, and sale of forfeited property; (4) pursue cases for the fraudulent transfer of property in order to avoid payment of child support arrearages; (5) withhold occupational, professional, and business licenses; (6) deny driver's licenses and vehicle registrations; and (7) periodically review and adjust child support orders. Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to require consumer reporting agencies to include overdue child support obligations in the consumer's credit report."
