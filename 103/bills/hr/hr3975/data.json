Amends the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act to require that, in certain cases, DoDDS teachers recruited abroad be entitled to the same benefits as teachers recruited in the United States. Requires the Director of Dependents' Education to establish for DoDDS teachers a voluntary leave transfer program and a voluntary leave transfer bank program. Limits the amount of graduate or undergraduate coursework which may be taken under a recertification program for DoDDS professional personnel. Amends Federal law to provide for continued health benefits for DoDDS teachers involuntarily separated from service under a reduction in force."
