    "text": "Congressional Ethics Reform Act - Prohibits a Member of Congress or employee of the legislative branch from soliciting or accepting a gift from any source except as provided in this Act. Provides that a gift accepted under the standards set forth in this Act shall not constitute an illegal gratuity otherwise prohibited by Federal law. Prohibits such a Member or employee from: (1) accepting a gift in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act; (2) soliciting or coercing the offering of a gift; (3) accepting gifts on a basis so frequent that a reasonable person would be led to believe the Member or employee is using his or her public office for private gain; (4) accepting a gift in violation of any statute; or (5) accepting vendor promotional training contrary to any applicable regulations, policies, or guidance relating to the procurement of supplies and services for the Congress. Specifies conditions under which such prohibitions shall not apply with respect to: (1) gifts based on a personal relationship; (2) discounts and similar benefits based on affiliation; (3) honorary degrees; (4) gifts based on outside business or employment relationships; (5) political events; (6) widely attended gatherings and other specified events; (7) food or entertainment in the course of official foreign travel or attendance at an event sponsored by a foreign government; (8) gifts accepted under specific statutory authority; and (9) items intended primarily for free distribution to constituents. Sets forth provisions regarding disposition by a Member or employee of prohibited gifts received, including permitting use of appropriated funds and franked mail to return such gifts. Provides that a Member or employee who promptly complies with disposition requirements shall not be deemed to have improperly accepted a gift. Repeals provisions of: (1) the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 permitting payments of honoraria on behalf of a Member, officer, or employee to a charitable organization or to an organization from which such an individual, his or her spouse, or any relative derives any financial benefit; and (2) the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 regulating acceptance of gifts and payment of foreign travel for Members, officials, or employees of the Senate, their spouses or dependents. Directs the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to prescribe rules establishing the conditions under which their respective Houses may accept payment, or authorize a Member or employee to accept payment on the House's behalf, from non-Federal sources for travel, subsistence, and related expenses with respect to attendance of the Member or employee (or his or her spouse) at any meeting or similar function relating to official duties. Requires the Committees to publish reports in the Congressional Record of payments accepted above $250."
