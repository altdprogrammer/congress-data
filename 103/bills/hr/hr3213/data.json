Outlines the process for such tests. Provides that if the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that it is necessary to include biological monitoring, testing, or assessment methods or whole effluent toxicity tests as a permit condition for publicly owned treatment works, the failure of such tests shall not result in a finding of violation."
