Requires that commercial fishing be allowed in the Park except areas designated as wilderness under the Act. Restricts, in certain areas, the annual average commercial fishing effort for each species and the type of gear allowed. Requires the season to be consistent with and not exceed the commercial fishing seasons established in adjacent waters, with exceptions. Mandates a study of whether the effect of commercial fishing authorized in the Park by this Act is having a detrimental effect on Park resources, including the opportunity for recreational use."
