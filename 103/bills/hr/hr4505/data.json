    "text": "Patent Term Amendment Act of 1994 - Revises Federal patent law to establish a 20-year patent term from the date of filing. Provides that, where the issuance of an original patent is delayed because of a proceeding regarding situations where a patent application would interfere with a pending application or with an unexpired patent, the term of the patent shall be extended for the period of delay up to five years. Sets forth provisions with respect to the filing of a provisional application for a patent. Specifies that a provisional application shall not be entitled to the right of priority of any other application or the benefit of an earlier filing date in the United States. Directs the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office to charge a $150 filing fee on each provisional application for an original patent."
