Amends the Shipping Act of 1984 to require each conference agreement to provide that: (1) any member of the conference may take independent action on any level of ocean freight forwarder compensation required to be filed in a tariff upon not more than ten calendar days notice; and (2) the conference will include the level of ocean freight forwarder compensation in its tariff for use by that member, effective no later than ten calendar days after receipt of the notice, and by any other member that notifies the conference that it elects to adopt such level of compensation on or after its effective date. Prohibits any conference or group of two or more common carriers from limiting the compensation of an ocean freight forwarder in the export foreign commerce of the United States to less than 1.25 percent of the aggregate of all of the rates and charges applicable under the tariff assessed against the cargo on which the forwarding services are provided."
