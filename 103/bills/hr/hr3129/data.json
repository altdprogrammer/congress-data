    "text": "Interstate Bank Consolidation Act of 1993 - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to cite circumstances under which a bank holding company may combine its subsidiary banks that are located in more than one State. Precludes such combinations within a State that has elected to prohibit them. Subjects such interstate bank combinations to the regulatory scheme of the host State. Permits the imposition of a proportion of a shares tax on an out-of-State bank by a host State. Grants the States a specified period within which to elect to either permit or prohibit on a nondiscriminatory basis such interstate combinations within their borders. Amends Federal banking law to reflect the provisions of this Act. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize host State regulatory authorities to enter into cooperative agreements to coordinate their examinations of out-of-State bank branches. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to include within its purview evaluations of the interstate branches of regulated financial institutions. Amends Federal banking law to permit State taxing authorities to review the records of a federally chartered depository institution for State tax purposes. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to prescribe guidelines for the use of bank names in a host State by a bank holding company seeking to consolidate its banks."
