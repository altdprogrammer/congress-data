Directs the President to certify that the peacekeeping operation meets the following policy guidelines: (1) the operation involves an international conflict in which hostilities have ceased and all significant parties to the conflict agree to the imposition of United Nations forces to seek a solution to the conflict; (2) the Congress was notified of the intent to support the operation under specified reprogramming procedures at least 15 days before approval of the operation by the United Nations Security Council; (3) the percentage of the U.S.-assessed share of the operation is no greater than the percentage assessment for the regular United Nations budget; (4) no U.S. intelligence information involving sensitive sources and methods of intelligence gathering will be provided to support the operation; and (5) with respect to units of the armed forces trained to carry out direct combat missions, the operation advances U.S. national security interests, the units are critical to the success of the operation and will be under the command of the United States, and any armed forces member would be protected by the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War."
