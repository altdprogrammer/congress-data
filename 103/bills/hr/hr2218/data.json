(Current law targets these to LEAs in counties with such concentrations.) Requires the State educational agency, in States which receive the minimum concentration grant amount, to allocate such funds among LEAs in rank order of their respective concentration and numbers of children from low-income families and in amounts consistent with the degree of concentration of poverty. Allows only those LEAs with concentrations of poverty exceeding the statewide average to receive such funds. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to use data on counties or equivalent local government units if satisfactory data regarding LEAs are not available to calculate grant amounts."
