    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Education Begins with Families Act of 1994 - Amends the Head Start Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish quality standards for Head Start agencies and programs, including standards for performance in providing required health, education, parental involvement, nutritional, social, and other services, for administrative and financial management, and for facilities' condition and location. Provides for monitoring and for corrective actions or terminations if minimum standards are not met. (Sec. 3) Sets forth goals and priorities for training and technical assistance. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to take certain factors into consideration in allocating funds for program expansion. (Sec. 5) Allocates at least 25 percent of certain excess funds to specified quality improvement activities, plus such additional amounts as the Secretary finds necessary. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to carry out a continuing program of research, demonstrations, and evaluations of Head Start programs, including longitudinal studies, and to report on such activities. (Sec. 7) Establishes programs for families with infants and toddlers. Directs the Secretary to make grants for: (1) programs providing family-centered services for low-income families with very young children, designed to promote child development, parental role fulfillment, and movement toward self-sufficiency; and (2) evaluation of, and training and technical assistance for, projects under the Comprehensive Child Development Centers Act of 1988. Gives time-limited priority to certain entities, including Parent-Child Centers receiving assistance under the Head Start Act and programs receiving assistance under the Comprehensive Child Development Centers Act of 1988, and provides for selection of other grant recipients. Repeals the Comprehensive Child Development Centers Act of 1988 because its functions are being consolidated under the Head Start Act. (Sec. 8) Revises parental involvement considerations with respect to designation of new Head Start agencies. Requires agencies to offer to parents of participating children: (1) family literacy services; (2) parenting skills training; (3) nonpunitive discipline training; (4) child development training; (5) communication skills development assistance; and (6) opportunities to share experiences with other parents. Allows agencies also to opt to offer such parents parental social self-sufficiency training, substance abuse counseling, in-home visitation for families at risk of child abuse and neglect, or other partnership in education activities. Requires a family needs assessment, including consultation with the parents, for each participating family. (Sec. 9) Extends the authorization of appropriations."
