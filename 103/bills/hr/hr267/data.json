    "text": "Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to establish procedures under which a court-martial may prescribe the death sentence. Requires that: (1) the sentence of death be concurred in unanimously; (2) the offense must be one expressly made punishable by death; and (3) the trial counsel must notify the accused of the intent to prove the existence of an aggravating factor, which is required before a sentence of death may be pronounced. Lists aggravating factors, including committing an offense in the presence of the enemy, presenting a grave risk to national security, and attempting to avoid hazardous duty. Requires the military judge, in the presence of the accused and counsel, to instruct the members of the court-martial on the aggravating factors, all applicable requirements and procedures, and the requirement to consider all evidence in extenuation and mitigation before adjudging a sentence of death. Prohibits a death sentence from being adjudged unless each member of the court-martial concurs that: (1) at least one aggravating factor has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the aggravating circumstances substantially outweigh any extenuating or mitigating circumstances or are themselves sufficient to justify a sentence of death. Requires that any aggravating factors found be announced by the military judge upon determination of the death sentence."
