Authorizes the Secretary to carry out such program directly or through grants, commitments for grants, or advances of funds to non-Federal entities. Specifies that such program shall: (1) consist of cost-effective measures and associated works to reduce salinity from saline springs, leaking wells, irrigation sources, industrial sources, erosion of public and private land, or other appropriate sources; and (2) provide for the mitigation of incidental fish and wildlife values that are lost as a result of such measures. Directs the Secretary to submit planning reports concerning the program to the appropriate congressional committees. Prohibits the Secretary from expending funds for any such implementation program before the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary submits such report. Authorizes appropriations."
