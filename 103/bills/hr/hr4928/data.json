    "text": "IDEA Improvement Act of 1994 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to revise the definition of individualized education program to include: (1) statements of the present educational performance levels of the child, and the annual goals designed to help the child succeed, in the general educational program for nondisabled children; and (2) a description of how designed services under the previous program have been modified if the previous annual goals were not substantially achieved. Requires the local educational agency or intermediate educational unit to revise program provisions at the beginning of the next school year for each child who has failed to substantially achieve the goals for the prior school year. Provides for increasing participation of parents in meetings relating to the development of the special education program. Provides for improved communication with parents through clearly written explanations of terminology in notices and publication of procedural safeguards under IDEA. Establishes mediation procedures under the special education program and the early intervention services program for infants and toddlers with disabilities, including requirements relating to State plans, procedural safeguards, regional resource centers, and parent information and training programs. Provides for coordination of services under the special education program: (1) through interagency agreements; and (2) with Even Start, Head Start, and related programs providing family literacy services or other services in which parents or guardians of children with disabilities are eligible to participate. Requires that the parent or guardian has exercised good faith in attempting to resolve the controversy prior to filing a complaint and requesting a hearing, as a condition for reimbursement of attorney's fees."
