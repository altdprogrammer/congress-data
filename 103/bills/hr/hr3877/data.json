    "text": "Two Strikes and In Act of 1994 - Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States and to multi-State compact associations for: (1) developing, constructing, expanding, operating, and improving boot camp prison programs, city or county detention facilities, or low- to medium-security prisons; (2) developing, constructing, and operating prisons that house and provide treatment for violent offenders with serious substance abuse problems; and (3) assisting in activating existing boot camp or prison facilities that are unutilized or underutilized because of a lack of funding. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) provide technical assistance to grantees; and (2) utilize components of the Department of Justice in carrying out this Act. Permits the utilization of grant funds to contract with the private sector to design, construct, or provide any services associated with facilities funded. Sets forth application procedures. Requires a State, to be eligible, to provide a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole for individuals who have been previously convicted of a crime of violence at the State or Federal level. Provides for revocation or suspension of funding where a grant recipient is not in substantial compliance with the terms and requirements of an approved grant application. Grants the Attorney General and the Comptroller General access for the purpose of audit and examination to pertinent records of a grant recipient and of other persons and entities that are involved in programs for which assistance is provided under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
