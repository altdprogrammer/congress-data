    "text": "Brownfield Cleanup and Redevelopment Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) establish certification criteria for State voluntary cleanup programs at eligible facilities; and (2) certify qualified States to carry out cleanup programs at eligible facilities in lieu of any Federal program that addresses the cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Defines \"eligible facility\" as a facility that is determined by a State to have environmental contamination that: (1) could prevent the timely use, development, or reuse; and (2) is limited in scope and can be readily evaluated. Requires the Administrator to ensure that State programs continue to meet the terms of certification by conducting biennial audits. Sets procedures for withdrawal of certification where deficiencies are not resolved. Directs the Administrator to require a State program, to be certified, to provide: (1) that only eligible facilities may paraticipate; (2) adequate opportunities for public participation in the development and implementation of cleanup plans; (3) technical assistance throughout each voluntary cleanup; (4) adequate oversight and enforcement authority to ensure that the voluntary cleanups comply with Federal and State laws; and (5) for State certification to the owner or prospective purchaser of an eligible facility that the cleanup is complete. Prohibits requiring a Federal, State, or local permit for any cleanup conducted under and in compliance with a certified State voluntary cleanup program."
