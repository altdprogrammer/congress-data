Amends the Arms Control and Disarmament Act to grant the Director primary responsibility for the preparation and management of U.S. participation in all international negotiations and implementation forums in arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to provide for the participation of the Director in specified arms export and licensing activities. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for consideration of the Director's judgment in specified nuclear export activities. Requires all determinations under such Act to remove data from the Restricted Data category to be made only after consultation with the Director. Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to require the Department of Commerce to maintain controls over all export items, other than those licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could be, if used for purposes other than those for which the export is intended, of significance for nuclear explosive purposes. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish procedures for establishing a list of such items, permitting automated access to all license applications, and for interagency referral of applications for the export of items on the list."
