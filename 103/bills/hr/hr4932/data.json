Requires the Secretary, in preparing such plan, to comply with specified procedures for negotiated rulemaking, with exceptions, including by establishing a negotiated rulemaking committee and publishing notice within 60 days. Specifies that if a negotiated rulemaking committee reaches a consensus on a plan, the Secretary may submit the plan to the New England Fishery Management Council (and if the Secretary submits the plan, it shall be treated as having been prepared by the Secretary) under the Act."
