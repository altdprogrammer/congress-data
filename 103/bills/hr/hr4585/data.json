Bases such amount on the standard deduction. (Replaces current income tax procedures for individuals.) Increases the basic standard deduction for individuals and includes an additional standard deduction for dependents, with inflation adjustments. (Sec. 102) Replaces the current tax on corporations with a tax on every person engaged in a business activity equal to 20 percent (17 percent after December 31, 1996) of the business taxable income of such person. Makes the person engaged in the business activity liable for the tax. (Sec. 103) Repeals income tax withholding. Title II: Spending Restraint and Budget Process Reform - Subtitle A: Joint Budget Resolution - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to reform the budget process by requiring a joint resolution on the budget instead of the concurrent resolution on the budget. Subtitle B: Zero Based Budgeting and Decennial Sunsetting - Terminates spending authority for unearned entitlements and high-cost discretionary spending programs for FY 1994, and discretionary spending programs (not including high-cost programs) for FY 1995, unless such spending is reauthorized after the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 212) Establishes a point of order against legislation that appropriates funds, which may be waived by a three-fifths vote of each House of Congress. (Sec. 213) Requires the reauthorization of discretionary spending authority and unearned entitlements every ten years beginning in the first decennial census year after 2000. Subtitle C: Spending Caps on the Growth of Entitlements for Fiscal Years 1995 Through 2000 - Declares that for FY 1995 through 2000 the total level of entitlement and mandatory spending, excluding social security, shall not exceed the total level for the previous fiscal year increased by the consumer price index and growth in eligible population. Requires sequestration as necessary to reduce spending. Provides for making uniform reductions with limitations. Lists programs and activities exempt from sequestration and provides exceptions, limitations, and special rules. Establishes a point of order against entitlement programs which may be waived by a three-fifths vote of each House. Subtitle D: Balanced Budget by Fiscal Year 2000 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act to revise the budget enforcement process. (Sec. 231) Establishes maximum spending amounts for FY 1995 through 1999 and revises sequestration procedures for enforcement. (Sec. 233) Establishes a point of order against exceeding permissible total spending. Title III: Regulatory Relief - Subtitle A: Private Property Rights Protection and Compensation - Declares that a private property owner is entitled to receive compensation for any reduction in the value of property of the owner that is: (1) a consequence of a limitation on an otherwise lawful use of the property imposed by a final agency action; and (2) measurable and not negligible. Subtitle B: Measuring Costs of Federal Regulations - Requires the Office of Management and Budget to report annually to the President, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to report annually to the Congress, on projections of costs of complying with Federal mandates. (Sec. 322) Requires the President to make annual recommendations to the Congress to ensure that such costs do not exceed their corresponding baseline costs. Subtitle C: Risk Assessment and Cost/Benefit Analyses and Reports - Includes in CBO reports on the cost of legislation: (1) an estimate of private sector compliance costs in the effective fiscal year and the next four fiscal years; (2) an estimate of the risks to the public health and safety which would result from any significant bill or resolution; and (3) an estimate of the effects of any significant bill or resolution on the economy, including the rate of gross domestic product growth, job loss, and price stability."
