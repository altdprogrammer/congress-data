    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1993-01-05", 
    "text": "Campaign Information Improvement Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to: (1) limit the cost to qualified candidates of broadcasting time for pre-election political advertising to the lowest charge of the station for the same amount of time for the same time of day and day of the week; (2) prohibit any broadcast licensee from preempting the use of any such time purchased and paid for by a qualified candidate, unless the program during which the advertisement was scheduled to appear is preempted due to circumstances beyond the control of the broadcaster; (3) reduce the pre-election period during which the lowest charge is effective from 45 days to 30 days before primary elections and from 60 days to 45 days before general or special elections; and (4) specify that for purposes of calculating a station's lowest charge, broadcasters must consider the charges made during the 60-day period prior to a primary or primary runoff election and during the 90-day period before a general or special election. Requires radio broadcasting stations, in order to have their licenses renewed, to make available without charge not less than 30 minutes of broadcast time during appropriate viewing hours to candidates for the House and Senate within the four weeks preceding election day for policy debates. Imposes the same free-time obligations on cable television operators of channels for public, educational, or governmental use."
