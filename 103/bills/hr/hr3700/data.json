Directs the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General to notify the Child Support Enforcement Division of the Department of Health and Human Sevices (HHS) of the names of any individuals whose assets are seized. Directs the HHS Secretary to then notify the appropriate State agency of the name of any such individual who is delinquent in child support and inform such agency of the seizure. Requires the State agency to then notify the appropriate party to whom such child support is owed. Allows such party to petition the Secretary of the Treasury for arrears payment from seized funds within 30 days from the date of notification. Establishes a trust fund for the making of such payments and related expenses."
