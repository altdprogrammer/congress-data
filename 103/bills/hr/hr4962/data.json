Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to State, interstate, and regional water pollution control agencies and public or nonprofit agencies to assist development of the plan. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the water resources divisions of the Idaho and Washington districts of the U.S. Geological Survey, to: (1) develop an integrated geographic information system of the Coeur d'Alene Basin; (2) convert all partial recording sites in the Basin to continuous monitoring stations with full gauging capabilities and status; and (3) establish additional continuous monitoring sites in the Basin as necessary to carry out basic data collection and monitoring. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service, to: (1) establish a fisheries restoration, development, and conservation program; and (2) conduct a wildlife species and habitat assessment survey in the Basin. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, to carry out specified environmental restoration activities in the Basin. Authorizes appropriations.
