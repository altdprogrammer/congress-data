Requires any transferor who, after a transfer, receives a report that receipt or possession of the handgun by the individual violates the law, to: (1) furnish information to the chief law enforcement officer of the transferor's place of business and the individual's place of residence; and (2) keep confidential any information received which is not otherwise available to the public, with exceptions. Sets forth transferor record-keeping requirements."
