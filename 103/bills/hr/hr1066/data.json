    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1993-02-23", 
    "text": "Antarctic Environmental Protocol Act of 1993 - Directs the Secretary of State to appoint a U.S. representative to the Committee for Environmental Protection (Committee) under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Treaty) (done at Madrid in October 1991). Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) conduct an activity within Antarctica in a manner inconsistent with the Protocol; (2) engage in or knowingly provide assistance to any Antarctica mineral resource activity; (3) introduce any prohibited product within Antarctica; (4) conduct open burning, or operate a landfill at a U.S. coastal facility, within Antarctica; (5) bring any dog into Antarctica; (6) use leaded fuel at a U.S. facility or in a U.S. vessel or aircraft within Antarctica; (7) transport passengers within Antarctica in a vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction unless the owner or operator is required to comply with the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships; (8) engage in specified activities without a permit; (9) violate any terms of this Act; (10) have control of any native bird, mammal, plant, or invertebrate or mineral resource which the person knows was taken in violation of this Act; (11) refuse to permit any authorized U.S. employee to board a U.S. vessel for conducting any search or inspection in connection with enforcement; or (12) interfere with any search or interfere with or resist a lawful arrest or detention. Waives the prohibition on activities conducted without a permit under emergency circumstances. Prohibits specified activities in Antarctica except in accordance with a permit. Prohibits the issuance of a permit unless there is sufficient information to assess possible environmental impacts. Provides that permits which authorize any taking may only be issued for providing specimens for scientific study or for the unavoidable consequences of scientific research activities and subjects permit issuance to certain conditions. Establishes conditions for the issuance of permits for: (1) takings of specially protected species; (2) the introduction of nonindigenous animals or plants; and (3) entry into specially-protected areas. Requires permits which authorize the construction or operation of incinerators to: (1) reduce emissions and restrict incinerated material to food waste; and (2) prohibit the operation of incinerators after 1994, unless there is no alternative for the disposal of food. Authorizes Federal agency activities in Antarctica if the agency monitors them and verifies a minor or transitory environmental impact. Directs Federal agencies, if activities will have more than a minor or transitory environmental impact, to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). Directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, to issue regulations establishing procedures for the environmental assessment of nongovernmental activities in Antarctica. Provides for review of an EIS by the Treaty parties and the Committee prior to permission for an activity to proceed. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary, to implement a plan for monitoring activities within Antarctica that have more than a minor or transitory environmental impact. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary, to develop requirements for contingency plans for responses to incidents with adverse environmental impacts in Antarctica. Requires the Secretary of State to circulate to all Treaty parties all inspection and compliance reports. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to apply Annex IV of the Protocol to all ships of U.S. registry and all ships under U.S. jurisdiction. Applies Protocol requirements to ships currently excluded from the requirements of such Act. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to administer the Protocol. Repeals the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 and the Antarctic Protection Act of 1990. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the prohibition on Antarctic mineral resource activities should remain in effect permanently or indefinitely; (2) the Secretary of State should enter into negotiations with other Treaty parties to conclude an agreement on procedures for liability for damage arising from activities in Antarctica; and (3) the results of all investigations relating to geological processes and structures should be made available to the public. Authorizes appropriations."
