    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) an appropriate commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Mariana campaign of World War II should be planned by the United States in conjunction with the Governments of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior should take steps to ensure that appropriate visitor facilities at War in the Pacific National Historical Park, Guam, are developed and constructed and a monument completed by July 21, 1994, for the historical interpretation of the campaign. Authorizes the Secretary, within the boundaries of the Park, to: (1) construct a monument to commemorate the loyalty of the people of Guam and the heroism of the American forces that liberated Guam; and (2) implement programs to interpret experiences of the people of Guam during World War II, including oral histories of people who experienced the occupation. Requires the Secretary, through the Director of the National Park Service, to develop and submit to specified congressional committees a report containing updated cost estimates for the development of the Park and a general plan to implement this Act, including cost estimates for the design and construction of the monument. Requires the Secretary to take steps to preserve and protect various World War II vintage weapons and fortifications which exist within the Park. Increases the authorization of appropriations for development of the Park."
