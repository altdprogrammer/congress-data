Makes such parcels eligible for transfer upon the enactment and submission to specified congressional committees by Guam of a land use plan. Requires the Administrator to appraise such excess property and submit the appraisals to specified congressional committees. Prohibits the transfer of parcels of land under this Act until after Guam enters into a cooperative agreement with the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, which grants administrative jurisdiction to the Secretary over all undeveloped lands within the boundary of the War in the Pacific National Historical Park to be managed in accordance with the Park's general management plan and in the same manner as federally-owned lands within such Park. Excludes lands owned by Guam at Adelup Point. Requires the conveyance document for any land transferred within six nautical miles of an airport to require a determination by the Federal Aviation Administration of no hazard to air navigation in order for construction or alteration on the property to be permitted. Authorizes the Administrator to disallow transfer of any parcel on which there is severe contamination, the remedy of which would require the United States to incur extraordinary costs. States that all Federal and territorial environmental laws and regulations shall apply to parcels transferred under this Act during and after such transfer."
