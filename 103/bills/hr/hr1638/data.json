Requires the Board to: (1) administer an exam and the awarding of scholarships; and (2) provide for placement of scholarship award recipients at one of the Member Institutes and in positions to fulfill service requirements. Expands the scholarship program to include the top two scorers, rather than just the top scorer, on the exam in each congressional district. Provides that a scholarship shall cover the full tuition and fees of the student at the Academy (currently the scholarship is $5,000 per academic year). Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations. Directs the Administrator of General Services to construct the Academy's headquarters in the greater metropolitan area of Youngstown-Warren, Ohio. Authorizes appropriations."
