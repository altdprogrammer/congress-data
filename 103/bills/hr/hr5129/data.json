Directs the Secretary to cease such reductions if the allied level achieved is equal to or above a specified goal. Urges the President to seek to have European member nations of NATO assume an increased share of nonpersonnel costs of U.S. military installations in such countries in accordance with a specified timetable. Allows the Secretary to continually maintain a European end strength level of 25,000 members. Authorizes the President or the Secretary to waive such reductions in the event of a significant threat to national security. Provides for the allocation of such force reductions among military personnel."
