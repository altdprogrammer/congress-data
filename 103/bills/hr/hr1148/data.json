Title II: Law Enforcement Responsibility Provisions - Subtitle A: Police Accreditation - Establishes procedures by which law enforcement agencies of a State, unit of local government, or non-Federal public agency may apply for law enforcement agency accreditation. (Sec. 202) Grants the Attorney General discretion to provide financial and technical assistance for law enforcement agencies applying for accreditation. Directs the Attorney General to appoint an Accreditation Coordinator to assist such agencies seeking Federal assistance in processing accreditation. Subtitle B: Civilian Protection in Cases of Police Misconduct - Requires that State, local, and public law enforcement agencies have procedures, including specified minimum standards, allowing citizen submission of sworn complaints regarding the action or inaction of a law enforcement agency, its officers, or employees. (Sec. 213) Specifies that any or all records required pursuant to this Act may be sealed to prevent public disclosure if good cause has been shown by order of a court of competent jurisdiction and if such order is public record and states reasons for sealing. Subtitle C: Law Enforcement Officer's Responsibility - Sets forth minimum standards that apply whenever a law enforcement officer is under formal investigation for alleged malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance of official duty, with a view to possible disciplinary action, demotion, dismissal, suspension, or criminal charges, with exceptions. (Sec. 222) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) notice of disciplinary action; (2) entitlement to a hearing; (3) fair representation on complaint review boards; and (4) protection from retaliation for exercising rights. Subtitle D: General Provisions - Grants any citizen or law enforcement officer the right to recover damages, including full reinstatement of a law enforcement officer, from any person or agencies which violate the rights established by this title. (Sec. 233) Specifies that nothing in this title shall be construed to preempt any State law which meets or exceeds the minimum requirements set forth by this title."
