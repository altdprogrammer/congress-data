Requires the disclosure document to be filed annually with the Department, and requires the Department to make available to the Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and other Federal agencies, as requested, copies of such document, as well as provide for public viewing. Requires the Department to establish procedures for the compilation, analysis, and publication of statistical information on franchise ownership and national franchising practices, using as its principal source of information the disclosure documents required under this Act. Requires the Department to take specified actions to ensure that such statistical information is accurate and updated at least annually. Requires the Department to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the information and findings relating to franchise ownership and national franchising practices required to be compiled under this Act. Directs the Department's Bureau of the Census to include in each Business Census beginning with 1997 statistical information on the number, ownership, and operation of franchise businesses."
