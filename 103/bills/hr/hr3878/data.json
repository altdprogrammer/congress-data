Allows the Secretary to exempt categories of research from such consent requirement. Requires congressional notification of such exemptions and a 60-day waiting period before the exemption is effective. Directs the Secretary to establish requirements for obtaining informed consent. Provides for civil actions by those from whom no such consent was obtained, allowing damages, equitable relief, and attorney's fees and costs. Preempts any State law concerning the obtaining of such consent."
