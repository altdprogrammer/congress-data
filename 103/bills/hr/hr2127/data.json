Amends SSA title XI to revise demonstration waiver provisions. Amends SSA title IV parts B and E to provide for recovery of training costs. Amends SSA title IV part E to make permanent the independent living program and to maintain basic and additional ceiling amounts at the latter amounts authorized under current law. Provides that in determining the eligibility of an individual aged 16 for foster care maintenance payments under such part, the State agency shall disregard from the resources of the individual an amount not exceeding what the agency determines to be reasonable for the purpose of achieving self-sufficiency. Amends the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 to repeal provisions respecting the annual report on voluntary placement."
