Provides for exchange of information concerning such individuals with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Amends the same SSA titles and Acts to require the appropriate agencies to furnish the Immigration and Naturalization Service with the names and addresses of, and other identifying information on, any individual known to be an illegal alien. Amends AFDC provisions to require termination of benefits for dependent children absent from the home for specified periods of time, with allowance for good cause exceptions."
