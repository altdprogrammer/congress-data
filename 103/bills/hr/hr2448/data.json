    "text": "Radon Awareness and Disclosure Act of 1994 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate model construction standards for controlling radon levels in new vulnerable premises (any frequently occupied space below the third floor of any building other than one used for industrial purposes) which are located in high radon areas and are covered by standards published on March 21, 1994. Requires promulgation of such standards in new vulnerable premises that are not covered by the March 1994 standards within two years of this Act's enactment. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator to ensure that organizations responsible for developing national model codes for new vulnerable premises adopt, and State and local authorities which regulate construction of such premises adopt and enforce, Federal model construction standards. Requires the Administrator to publish a pamphlet describing the standards and their costs and benefits. Directs any person who sells a new vulnerable premises, prior to the signing of a sales contract, to: (1) provide the purchaser with a specified pamphlet on radon prevention in construction; (2) inform the purchaser that the premises are located in a high radon area and that the Administrator recommends that such premises be constructed in compliance with model construction standards; and (3) disclose to the purchaser whether the premises have been, or will be, constructed in compliance with such standards. Directs the Administrator to promulgate guidance for existing vulnerable premises not covered by proposed model standards published on April 12, 1993. (Sec. 5) Authorizes set-asides of grants made to States for radon abatement for local governments in high radon areas. (Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations to require: (1) products for radon measurement to meet performance criteria; and (2) persons offering services for radon measurement or mitigation to meet a level of proficiency. Provides for fees to be imposed on persons manufacturing or importing such products and on persons offering such services to cover program costs. Waives fees for employees of child care facilities, schools, hospitals, or other care facilities. (Sec. 7) Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations for the disclosure of radon in vulnerable premises offered for sale or lease (except leases for terms of one year or less that do not provide for extensions). Requires contracts for such premises to contain radon warning statements and affords potential purchasers the right to conduct a test and access to a radon hazard information pamphlet. (Sec. 8) Authorizes State programs to enforce Federal requirements for incentives for voluntary compliance, radon measurement or mitigation services, or disclosure of information concerning radon, subject to the Administrator's approval. (Sec. 9) Makes Federal agencies subject to Federal, State, and local requirements respecting radon in the same manner as such requirements are applied to nongovernmental entities. (Sec. 10) Directs the Administrator to develop a strategy for identifying areas and buildings within the United States with exceptionally high levels of radon and for reducing such radon levels. (Sec. 11) Requires the Administrator to implement an outreach program to provide information about radon to the medical community. (Sec. 12) Directs the Administrator to ensure that the presentation of information on the health risks associated with exposure to radon is unbiased and informative. (Sec. 13) Authorizes appropriations for radon control activities (except activities to address radon in schools) for FY 1994 through 1997. (Sec. 15) Establishes the President's Commission on Radon Awareness. Requires the Administrator to establish a national education campaign to increase awareness of radon health risks and motivate action to reduce radon levels. (Sec. 16) Expresses the sense of the Congress, in the case of any equipment or products that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided under this Act, that entities receiving such assistance should purchase only American-made equipment and products."
