Provides that payments to States for outdoor recreation may not cover more than 75 percent of: (1) the cost of acquisition of specified lands, waters, and interests; or (2) the cost of revising comprehensive State outdoor recreation plans to conform to specified requirements. Permits counties or political subdivisions to receive funds allocated to States for land acquisition purposes to cover up to 50 percent of the cost of developing or revising local plans to retain land for recreation and open space preservation purposes. Authorizes counties or other governmental entities to receive funds to cover up to 60 percent of the cost of acquiring lands, waters, or interests, following adoption of a plan and through September 30, 1997. Treats Indian tribes and Alaska Native Village Corporations collectively as one State for purposes of receiving outdoor recreation assistance and provides for a competitive grant program for the receipt of such assistance. Requires statewide outdoor recreation plans to contain: (1) a description of Federal and State activities that adversely affect open space and recreational resources; and (2) an evaluation of the extent to which local zoning or the lack of zoning contributes to degradation of State and local projects funded with outdoor recreation assistance. Establishes a program to provide Federal assistance to States, local and interstate entities, and private nonprofit organizations for the protection or establishment of: (1) Greenways (linear parks or open spaces linking natural and cultural features within or near metropolitan areas); and (2) Urban Open Space Preserves (open spaces with natural, rural, or agricultural character within large metropolitan areas). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct studies and report to the Congress on Federal assistance to protect open space areas. Authorizes appropriations from the Fund for loans to State, local, or interstate entities if recreational resources are of vital significance and are in imminent danger of damage or when an opportunity to address a severe recreation deficiency will be foregone. Establishes an advisory board to assist in the selection of projects to receive such assistance."
