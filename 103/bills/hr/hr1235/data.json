    "text": "Congressional Campaign and Administrative Reform Act of 1993 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act (Act) of 1971 to limit multicandidate political committee (PAC) contribution authority. Delineates specified circumstances where an expenditure shall constitute an expenditure in coordination with a candidate rather than an independent expenditure. Amends the Internal Revenue Code with regard to congressional contributions to allow: (1) a credit of up to $100 for an individual and $200 for a joint return; and (2) a deduction of up to $500 for an individual and $1,000 for a joint return. Amends the Act to provide for voluntary expenditure limitations for House of Representatives elections. Subjects to certain limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements any amount (\"soft money\") paid by the national committee of a political party or a State committee of a political party with respect to an activity (such as voter registration or a get-out-the vote effort) which is intended both to influence a Federal election and achieve another purpose. Limits contributions from persons other than local individual residents for House of Representatives elections. Requires members of the House of Representatives to account for franked mail (with specified exceptions)."
