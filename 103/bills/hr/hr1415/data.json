Limits eligibility. Specifies that: (1) the minimum active-duty service requirement of any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs shall apply in determining eligibility for veterans' benefits under this Act; (2) the 12-month requirement under this Act shall not apply to an individual who is permanently disabled in the performance of such service while the vessel is subjected to hostile action; and (3) such service may have been rendered before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act, with a limitation. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide that any medal awarded to a member of the merchant marine for service during a period of war be provided without charge."
