(Sec. 2) Prohibits the Administrator from closing Office field stations, laboratories, or other research centers or permitting Office reductions-in-force unless congressional committees have received advance notice. (Sec. 3) Directs the Administrator to establish in the Office separately identified core research programs consisting of fundamental research on ecology and environmental science and on exposure to, and effects of, environmental contamination. Requires such research to support efforts to assess and mitigate serious environmental risks. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator to establish an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program to conduct environmental research and development to design a long-term environmental monitoring program to determine the current condition of, and trends in, U.S. ecological resources. Requires the Administrator to make available to the public and the Congress statistical data summaries and interpretive reports on ecological status and trends. (Sec. 5) Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a modernization program for Office laboratories to identify, acquire, and maintain modern buildings, facilities, supplies, and equipment needed to conduct high quality research; and (2) conduct studies and make assessments of the adequacy of the equipment and facilities to meet the needs of EPA and to attract well-qualified scientists, engineers, and other appropriate personnel. (Sec. 6) Repeals a required annual report from the Administrator of a five-year plan for environmental research, development, and demonstration. (Sec. 10) Directs the Administrator to: (1) carry out a program of environmental technology transfer and exchange of scientific information to make full use of the Office's research, development, and demonstration efforts; and (2) establish a separately identified research program to improve EPA's capability to identify and assess risks resulting from environmental contamination. (Sec. 12) Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a program to conduct research on lead; (2) carry out a research program within the Office to reduce scientific uncertainties with respect to risk assessment; and (3) report to the Congress on opportunities for the technology transfer of defense-related research for environmental applications. (Sec. 15) Authorizes the Administrator to enter into a cooperative agreement with a non-Government research foundation to conduct research on the disinfection of drinking water, subject to matching funding requirements. (Sec. 16) Directs the Administrator to enter into an arrangement with a private entity to study and make recommendations regarding the Office's acquisition and assistance management practices. Allocates funding for the lead and drinking water research programs and for the private study concerning the Office's acquisition practices. (Sec. 17) Expresses the sense of the Congress that any recipient of a grant under this Act should purchase, when available and cost-effective, American-made equipment and products when expending grant monies."
