Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to assist in studies that identify and plan for heritage areas or State systems or programs for such areas. Requires that such studies provide a means for evaluating candidate areas and systems for further Federal involvement upon congressional authorization. Limits such a grant to 50 percent of the cost of conducting the study. Sets forth provisions regarding application procedures, review criteria, study content, technical assistance, and recommendations for national designation. Establishes the National Partnership System of Heritage Areas. Designates as components thereof: (1) National Heritage Areas or Parks; (2) National Heritage Corridors established by law; and (3) the New York State Urban Cultural Park System. Requires the Secretary to request the Governor of the State in which the designated area or system is located to submit a management plan to the Secretary for review and approval. Permits the Secretary, upon request of a Governor, to provide technical assistance in the preparation and implementation of the plan. Sets forth provisions regarding the role and contents, approval, and implementation of the plans, as well as reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
