Requires the segment to be: (1) administered as a recreational river by the Secretary of the Interior through cooperative agreements between the Secretary and the State of Connecticut and its relevant political subdivisions; and (2) managed in accordance with the Upper Farmington River Management Plan. Deems the Plan to satisfy the requirement for a comprehensive management plan pursuant to the Act. Requires the Director of the National Park Service, or his or her designee, to represent the Secretary on the Farmington River Coordinating Committee provided for in the Plan. Requires the Secretary to offer to enter into cooperative agreements with the State of Connecticut and its relevant political subdivisions in order to provide for the long-term protection, preservation, and enhancement of the segment and to make a similar offer to the Farmington River Watershed Association. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with other parties who may be represented on the Committee; and (2) provide technical assistance, staff support, and funding to assist in implementation of the Plan. Provides that implementation of this Act through such cooperative agreements shall not constitute National Park Service administration of the segment and shall not cause the segment to be considered as being a unit of the National Park System. Requires the Plan to serve as the primary source of information regarding the flows needed to maintain instream resources and the potential compatibility between resource protection and possible water supply withdrawals. Deems the zoning ordinances adopted by specified towns and the river protection overlay districts in effect on the enactment of this Act to satisfy the standards and requirements of the Act. Authorizes appropriations."
