Provides for termination of a child's insurance benefits based on the work record of a stepparent upon the remarriage of the child's natural parent after divorce from such stepparent. Sets forth circumstances in the case of existing entitlements where a child shall be deemed as not dependent on the stepparent (hence ineligible for insurance benefits)."
