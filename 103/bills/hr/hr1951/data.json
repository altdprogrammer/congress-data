Provides that, with the exception of those lands used by the District for the new stadium, use of the National Park Service (NPS) lands leased to the District for stadium and stadium parking lots purposes shall continue in accordance with such Act. Extends the term of the authorized use for a maximum 99-year period. Vests responsibility and authority exclusively in the District for construction, maintenance, and operation of the parking lots on NPS lands leased to the District for parking lot purposes. States that except for that area of land used by the District for the new stadium and that area of land bounded by the Armory Plaza bridge approaches of the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge, specified lands shall be made available to the District during the maximum 99-year term of such use only for overflow parking for not more than 1,200 automobiles and shall be maintained as grassed park land suitable for public recreation uses. Vests responsibility and authority exclusively in the District for construction maintenance, naming, and operation of the new stadium.
