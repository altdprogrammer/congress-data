    "text": "Recreational Boating Safety Improvement Act of 1993 - Amends Federal boating safety law to prohibit a person from operating a recreational vessel under 26 feet in length unless each individual 12 years or younger wears a personal flotation device while on the vessel's deck during operation. Declares that such prohibition shall not be construed to limit a State's authority to establish more stringent requirements for the wearing of personal flotation devices on recreational vessels. Limits to no more than 25 percent of Federal funds for recreational boating safety programs the amount that a State may use for acquiring, constructing, or repairing public access sites used primarily by recreational boaters. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of State recreational boating safety program funds based upon State adoption of laws prohibiting the operation of recreational vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Declares that persons who willfully operate a recreational vessel in violation of this Act may be ordered to complete a qualified recreational boating safety course in addition to or in lieu of other civil penalties."
