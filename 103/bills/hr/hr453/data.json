    "text": "Educational Reform and Flexibility Act of 1993 (Ed-Flex) - Amends the General Education Provisions Act to establish a program for flexibility and accountability in education and related services. Directs the Secretary of Education to assist projects for elementary and secondary schools and other service providers to improve achievement of all students and other participants, but particularly disadvantaged individuals, by authorizing a limited number of waivers by which the performance of schools and programs can be improved by increasing their flexibility in use of resources while holding them accountable for achieving educational gains. Limits such waivers to not more than: (1) six States which have implemented comprehensive regulatory reform plans; and (2) 50 LEAs within each SEA of such States. Authorizes the Secretary to only waive a statutory or regulatory requirement applicable to a program under specified Federal laws relating to elementary, secondary, and vocational education and disadvantaged or homeless students. Authorizes other Federal agency heads, with the Secretary's agreement, to make similar waivers of such requirements applicable to an elementary, secondary, or youth vocational training program administered by such agencies. Limits duration of projects and associated waivers. Requires each project that involves elementary or secondary schools to include participation of an LEA and at least two schools. Requires, to the extent possible, project participation by each grade and academic program in a participating school. Sets forth application and planning requirements. Prohibits waiver of requirements: (1) in awarding new competitive grants to a service provider within the LEA or other applicant participating in such a project; (2) relating to maintenance of effort, comparability, or equitable participation of private school students; and (3) under specified provisions of specified Federal laws relating to individuals with disabilities. Sets forth requirements for reports, evaluations, budget neutrality, and a sunset provision."
