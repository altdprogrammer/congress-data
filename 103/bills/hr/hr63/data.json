Requires inclusion in the plan of any Bureau of Land Management recommendations as to the suitability or nonsuitability of specified lands within the Areas for preservation as wilderness. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to manage the lands and waters within the wilderness study areas to maintain their potential for inclusion within the National Wilderness Preservation System, pending submission of such recommendation and until otherwise directed by an Act of the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands and interests within the boundaries of the Area by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer from another Federal agency, except that such lands or interests owned by the State of Nevada or a political subdivision may be acquired only by donation or exchange. Withdraws all Federal lands within the Area from public land and mining laws (including mineral and geothermal leasing). Authorizes appropriations."
