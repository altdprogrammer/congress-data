(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of Education, under such program, to: (1) reserve specified funds for competitive grant awards to exemplary school programs; and (2) make allotments to State educational agencies (SEAs), for suballotment to local educational agencies (LEAs), based on relative Chapter 1 funding (for educationally disadvantaged students under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965). Requires recipient LEAs to make subgrants to community-based organizations or nonprofit partnerships between the LEA, local colleges or universities, or area-wide collaboratives of private sector businesses.
