Authorizes the FCC to exempt, as public interest requires, certain video and audio programming, including news broadcasts, sporting events, educational programming, and documentaries. Directs the FCC to consider, in its review of an application for renewal of a television or radio broadcast license, whether the licensee has complied with this Act."
