Requires five percent of funds to be withheld in the first fiscal year in which a State is not in compliance with such standard and ten percent for each succeeding year of noncompliance. Releases funds withheld in excess of three fiscal years to States that fail to adopt such standard, but permits such funds to be used only for programs approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminstration to prevent driving while intoxicated. Provides for the release of withheld funds to States that subsequently adopt the standard."
