Prohibits the court from imposing a probationary sentence on, or suspending the sentence of, any individual convicted of such a violation or from making any term of imprisonment so imposed run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, including that imposed for the crime of violence in which the firearm was carried. Permits: (1) any individual age 65 or older who has been imprisoned for at least ten years pursuant to a sentence imposed under this Act to petition the court for suspension of the remainder of such sentence of imprisonment; and (2) the court to suspend the remainder of such sentence upon determining that the person does not pose a danger to the community."
