(Sec. 120) Directs the Administrator to study the feasibility of a University Innovative Research Program which uses institutions of higher education to help meet NASA research and development needs by stimulating non-duplicative technology transfer between education and industry and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation. (Sec. 121) Directs the Administrator to study and report to Congress on the convergence of the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with commercial communications satellite systems. (Sec. 122) Requires NASA to report to Congress on: (1) specific space shuttle cost reduction initiatives; and (2) a plan for an advanced launch technology program. (Sec. 124) Expresses the sense of the Congress that NASA should pursue life and microgravity sciences research related to the causes of breast and ovarian cancers, bone-related diseases, and other women's health issues. (Sec. 125) Requires NASA to transmit annually to the Congress a report containing a complete accounting of all costs of the space station, including cash and other payments to Russia.

(Sec. 129) Requires NASA, in coordination with the Department of Defense and foreign space agencies, to catalogue certain comets and asteroids. Subtitle B: Aeronautics - Declares it is U.S. policy that: (1) revitalizing national aeronautical facilities shall be a major element of Federal investment in aeronautical research and development; and (2) industry and government cost-sharing for facilities construction and use shall be investigated to achieve goals within a constrained Federal budget. (Sec. 152) Directs the President to identify and assess all domestic and foreign aeronautics facilities and determine the risk to U.S. industry competitiveness due to potential unintended transfer of technology. (Sec. 153) Requires the President to work with domestic industries to develop a prioritized strategy for Federal investment in aeronautics research, technology, and facilities. (Sec. 154) Requires the President to develop a site selection plan for the location of new aeronautics research facilitates. Details site selection factors. (Sec. 155) Directs NASA to develop an aeronautical basic research investment plan and work with other Federal agencies to prioritize aeronautical technologies research to enhance U.S. competitiveness. Title II: Commercial Space Launch Amendments - Amends Federal law with regard to commercial space launch activities to extend the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to license commercial reentry vehicles. Requires an annual report to the Congress by the Secretary of Transportation describing licensing activities and reviewing the effectiveness of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation.
