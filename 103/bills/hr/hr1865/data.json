Sets forth specific requirements for grant agreements. Applies certain provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act regarding authorized uses of water pollution control revolving funds, corrective action, and auditing, reporting, and fiscal controls to water supply construction accounts. Sets forth amounts to be allotted to States and U.S. territories. Reserves a specified amount for grants to Indian tribes. Directs the Administrator to develop and submit to the Congress: (1) an estimate of the cost of needed construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of water supply systems in all States; and (2) a study of the economic impact on affected units of government of the cost of installation of water supply systems. Expresses the sense of the Congress that recipients of assistance under this Act should purchase American-made equipment and products. Authorizes appropriations."
