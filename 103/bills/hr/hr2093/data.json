Authorizes appropriations. Provides for the distribution of funds based on the pro rata number of licensed motor vehicles in a State. Limits the total amount of funds to be received by a State. Requires recipient States to distribute at least 50 percent of funds for the installation of clean fuel refueling facilities in the private sector. Makes a State eligible for a grant only if it has: (1) submitted a revision of the applicable implementation plan expressing its intention to adopt standards under the California clean fuel vehicle pilot test program; and (2) has adopted such standards no later than model year 1996."
