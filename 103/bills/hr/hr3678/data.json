Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to assess a fee based on the value of the resources and the public interest served by promoting development of the resources (but prohibits assessing any fee against a Federal agency); and (2) to seek to facilitate projects in the coastal zone that promote the policy set forth in the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. Requires: (1) any Federal agency which proposes to make use of sand, gravel, and shell resources subject to the provisions of this Act to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Secretary concerning the potential use of those resources; and (2) the Secretary to notify specified congressional committees on any proposed project for the use of those resources prior to such use. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of any area or region included in any lease sale in order to establish information needed for assessment and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments of the Outer Continental Shelf and the coastal areas which may be affected by mineral development in such area or region. Directs that, in the case of such agreement, each study pertaining to the agreement under this Act be commenced not later than six months prior to commencing negotiations for such agreement or entering into the Memorandum of Agreement."
