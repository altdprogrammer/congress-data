Requires the development of a Mediplan enrollment mechanism that includes automatic enrollment at birth and the issuance of Mediplan cards for identification and claims processing purposes. Provides the same benefits under the Mediplan program as are provided under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to individuals who are entitled to benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) and enrolled under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program. Provides additional Mediplan coverage to children under age 23, pregnant women, and low-income individuals. Establishes the Mediplan Trust Fund which shall consist of revenues raised by this Act's financing mechanism. Requires the modification of Medicaid (SSA title XIX) and other Federal health programs to avoid their duplication of Mediplan coverage. Requires group health plans which provide their current beneficiaries with benefits in addition to Mediplan benefits to continue to do so, though they need not provide such additional benefits to individuals not entitled to them before this Act's enactment. Provides for the regulation of Mediplan supplemental policies. Allows States to elect to have health care benefits made available instead under an alternative program meeting specified requirements. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to impose an excise tax with respect to Mediplan supplemental policies which fail to meet certain requirements. Title II: Cost Containment - (Sec. 201) Establishes a national budget for Mediplan expenditures. Details formulae for determining such expenditures and subsequent adjustments to them. (Secs. 202 and 203) Provides for the establishment of separate classes of health care services and the allocation of the national Mediplan expenditure budget by class of service. (Sec. 204) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national health expenditures reporting system for purposes related to the national Mediplan expenditure budget. (Secs. 205 and 206) Provides for the adjustment of Medicare payment rates for purposes related to Mediplan health expenditure allocations and graduate medical education. Title III: Financing Provisions - (Sec. 301) Amends IRC to impose an additional income tax on individuals and health service providers in order to finance Mediplan health care premiums."
