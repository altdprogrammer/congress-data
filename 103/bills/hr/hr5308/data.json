Specifies schedules of benefit reductions from ten percent to 100 percent for single and for married individuals. Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to provide annual social security account statements to eligible individuals with respect to such benefit limitations. Adjusts the gradual increase in retirement age from 65 to 68 so as to commence with calendar year 1996 and reach age 68 for those who would attain age 65 in or after calendar year 2031."
