    "text": "Department of Defense Set Aside Enforcement Act of 1993 - Requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to award ten percent of its annual defense procurement contracts and subcontracts to historically Black colleges and universities and small disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses. (Currently, it is a goal of DOD to award five percent annually to such entities.) Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, beginning on October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2000, to meet the ten percent requirement by awarding up to one half of the dollar amount of the contracts awarded to certain entities previously eligible for such contract award but no longer eligible by reason of size. Requires each entity that enters into a prime contract with DOD under the contract award program to spend at least five percent of the amount of the contract for subcontracts with certain covered entities meeting the requirements of small disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses. Requires prime contractor proof of the awarding of such subcontracts. Directs the Secretary to withhold five percent of the prime contract amount from the contract, which shall be used as direct payment to the subcontractors for work completed. Requires that, in a services contract awarded under such contracting procedures, at least 50 percent of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the covered entity. Provides alternative methods for meeting such 50 percent requirement. Outlines requirements for a small disadvantaged or minority-owned business for purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to require, as a condition for approval of a contract with DOD, that the potential contractor provide documentation that it is in compliance with the equal opportunity clause as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations. Requires identical certification by the subcontractors of such contractor."
