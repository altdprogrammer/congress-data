Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to: (1) waive such requirement if it would be inconsistent with the national security objectives of the United States; and (2) allow a contractor to make an exception in the case of a particular craft or trade if there is no individual residing or available for hire in the labor surplus area or county who possesses the skills for that craft or trade."
