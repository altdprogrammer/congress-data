Authorizes appropriations. Title I: Grants to States to Provide Worker Adjustment Assistance Benefits to Eligible Displaced Workers - Directs the Secretary of Labor to make grants to applicant States to provide worker adjustment assistance benefits to eligible dislocated workers. Title II: Worker Adjustment Assistance Benefits - Subtitle A: Income Support - Sets forth dislocated worker eligibility conditions. Requires a dislocated worker to be actively seeking employment or to be enrolled in training to be eligible for income support. Allows those eligible for income support to apply for training under subtitle C. Provides for weekly income support, including amount and duration, income support factors, additional weeks, adjustment of amount, wage supplement offsets, and application of State laws. Subtitle B: Wage Supplements - Provides for weekly wage supplements, in specified amounts for a maximum of 156 weeks, for eligible displaced workers. Makes dislocated workers who are eligible for such wage supplements also eligible to apply for part-time training under subtitle C. Offsets such wage supplement weeks by any income support weeks received under subtitle A. Subtitle C: Training - Sets forth conditions of State approval of training for displaced workers. Requires priority for training for occupations and industries that utilize new technologies. Sets forth requirements relating to State and Federal payment of training costs, as well as training costs paid from other sources. Lists types of training programs that may be approved. Sets certain restrictions on State approval. Makes 156 weeks of such training the maximum number which a dislocated worker may receive. Allows a State to authorize specified limited forms of supplemental assistance during such training. Directs a State to pay costs of any approved on-the-job training of a displaced worker, but only if certain conditions are met, such as nondisplacement of current workers, nonimpairment of collective bargaining agreements, and certification of continued employment for the trained worker. Prohibits declaring a displaced worker ineligible for State or Federal unemployment insurance or benefits under this Act because that individual is in or is entering approved training.
