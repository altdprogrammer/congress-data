Requires computation of the prevailing wage for the particular urban or rural subdivision of the State in which the work is to be performed. Requires establishment as the prevailing wage the entire range of wages paid to the corresponding class of workers in an area. Excludes Federal or federally assisted projects from the determination of prevailing wage, unless there is insufficient wage data. Allows use of semi-skilled helpers, on projects covered by the Act, in areas where such use is an identifiable practice. Prohibits contract-splitting to avoid applications of the Act. Applies the Act to local projects only if at least 25 percent of the project costs are paid by Federal funds. Exempts volunteer labor from coverage under the Act. Provides for direct payment of any back pay due to workers under the Act. Amends the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act to revise payroll information reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary of Labor and the Comptroller General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on implementation and impact on local wages and on local and national economies of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act."
