Authorizes the Secretary to enter into consultative agreements with the Steel Industry Heritage Task Force on projects and studies necessary to fulfill the Concept Plan. Authorizes the Task Force to receive appropriations through the Department of the Interior for projects and studies within the region of Southwestern Pennsylvania comprising the geographical area within the counties of Allegheny, Beaver, Fayette, Greene, Washington, and Westmoreland based on the project criteria established in the Concept Plan. Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Task Force, to undertake plans and studies, including studies of alternatives, special resources studies and new area studies, and management action plans necessary to determine and identify the appropriate role of the Government, through the National Park Service, to conserve and interpret the history of the region. Directs the Historic American Building Survey/Historic American Engineering Record to conduct those studies necessary to document the industrial, engineering, building, and architectural history of the region.
