Asks the States to develop a model statute which includes, with respect to such businesses: (1) licensing requirements and standards; (2) procedures to ensure compliance with Federal cash transaction reporting requirements; and (3) criminal penalties for operation of such a business without a license. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to the Congress on the States' progress in developing and enacting a model statute meeting appropriate requirements and recommendations for appropriate legislative and administrative action, including possible incentives or sanctions for States failing to enact an appropriate model statute or failing to enforce such statute."
