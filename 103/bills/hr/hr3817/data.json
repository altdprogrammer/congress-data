Mandates publication of a list of nations that impose transit fees and withholding of clearance for commercial fishing vessels of those nations for entry into U.S. waters west of a specified longitude, subject to exception. Declares the owner or master of a vessel entering in violation of these provisions to be in violation of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Makes the designation of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary effective on a specified date, notwithstanding specified provisions of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act."
