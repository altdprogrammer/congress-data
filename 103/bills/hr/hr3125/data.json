Directs the Attorney General to: (1) create a national, computerized list of prohibited persons; (2) incorporate State criminal history records into the Federal criminal records system maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; (3) develop hardware and software systems to link State lists with the national list; and (4) provide any responsible State agency with access to the national list upon request. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) procedures for correcting erroneous records; and (2) judicial review with respect to persons erroneously identified as prohibited persons. Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit (with exceptions) any licensed dealer from knowingly: (1) selling a handgun to an unlicensed person unless the dealer has used an electronic device to read the magnetic strip affixed to an identification document issued to such person by the transportation agency of the State in which the premises of the dealer is located; or (2) failing to notify local law enforcement authorities, within 72 hours, of any person attempting to purchase a handgun who is identified as a prohibited person through the use of such a device. Sets penalties for violations."
