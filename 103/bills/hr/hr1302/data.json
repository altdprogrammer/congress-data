(Sec. 106) Prohibits making any federally related mortgage loan secured by residential property located in a hurricane zone unless the property securing the loan has hurricane insurance. (Sec. 107) Requires Federal regulatory agencies to prohibit the lending institutions under their purview from participating in federally related mortgage loans secured by improved real estate or a mobile home located in a hurricane-prone State if neither the State nor the property is in compliance with this Act. Title II: National Hurricane Insurance Program - (Secs. 201-203) Requires the Director to: (1) establish a national hurricane insurance program for residential properties and additional properties if so indicated by further studies); and (2) establish insurability criteria for residential property.

Directs the Director, based upon such rates, to prescribe chargeable premium rates for hurricane coverage.
