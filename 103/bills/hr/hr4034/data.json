Directs the Secretary to give grant priority to local government programs meeting specified criteria, including: (1) targeting youth at the greatest risk of becoming involved in violence and crime; (2) teaching important values and life skills; (3) offering education and counseling in addition to recreation opportunities; and (4) showing the greatest potential of being continued with non-Federal funds or serving as models. Requires local governments, to be eligible for such grants, to include strategies to reduce crime and juvenile delinquency in their five-year action programs for park and recreation recovery. Requires no more than 25 percent of Federal grant funds made available under such Act to be used for program support. Repeals provisions limiting the duration of the urban park and recreation recovery program to five years."
