(Currently, the Bank is prohibited from financing such sales.) Defines a \"qualified country\" as Japan, any member of NATO (other than the United States), and any party to the security treaty (ANZUS Pact) between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (other than the United States). Limits the amount of financing provided in any fiscal year. Repeals provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 concerning the international military education and training program."
