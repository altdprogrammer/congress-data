Prohibits employers who do not provide such notice and benefits from entering into a contract with the United States for provision of products or services involved in the work transfer or substantially similar to such products or services. Provides for enforcement of this title by: (1) investigative and administrative actions and actions for injunctions by the Secretary of Labor; and (2) civil actions by employees, local governments, States, and the Secretary. Requires employers to post notice concerning this title and the filing of a charge. Authorizes civil fines for violations. Title II: Amendments to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act - Amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act to lower the number of employees an employer must have to be covered by such Act to 50 (currently 100) and the number involved to be considered a plant closing or mass layoff to 25 (currently 50 for a closing and various formulas for a layoff). Reduces the aggregate number of weekly hours of such employees by half to reflect such change. Increases the time period of notice required before plant closings and mass layoffs to 180 days. Adds to the damages for which an employer in violation of such Act is liable. Excludes liability for liquidated damages if the violation is a good faith act or omission. Adds required enforcement actions by the Secretary of Labor. Requires (currently allows) the prevailing party in a civil action against an employer under such Act to receive a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs. Requires employers to post notice concerning such Act and the filing of a charge. Authorizes civil fines for violations. Title III: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act and the amendments it makes."
