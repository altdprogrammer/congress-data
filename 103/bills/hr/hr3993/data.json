    "text": "Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit, and establish penalties for: (1) employing or inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, intending that such depiction will be imported into the United States or into waters within 12 miles of the coast of the United States; and (2) knowingly receiving, transporting, distributing, selling, or possessing with intent to transport, sell, or distribute such depiction, with such intent. Repeals the caps on fines for sexual exploitation of children. Subjects individuals who violate prohibitions against sexual exploitation of children (as under current law) or sexual abuse to a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both, and a fine or from five to 15 years, or both, if such individual has a prior conviction of sexual abuse. Sets forth: (1) analogous provisions with respect to certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of children (as under current law) or sexual exploitation of minors; and (2) penalties for conspiring and attempting to violate such provisions. Makes violation of this Act a predicate offense to a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute. Sets penalties for travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in a sexual act with a person under age 18. Expresses the sense of the Congress that each State that has not yet done so should enact legislation prohibiting the production, distribution, receipt, or simple possession of materials depicting a person under age 18 engaging in sexually explicit conduct and providing for a maximum imprisonment of at least one year and the forfeiture of assets used in the commission or support of, or gained from, such offenses."
