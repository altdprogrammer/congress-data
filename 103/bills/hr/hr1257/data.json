Prescribes data collection parameters for designated MSAs and insurers, including: (1) private passenger automobile insurance; (2) homeowners insurance; and (3) dwelling fire and allied lines of insurance. Requires the Secretary to establish a task force on insurance agency appointments to review and report to certain congressional committees on: (1) the status of insurance agency appointments for inner city and minority agents; (2) the practices of insurers in terminating agents; and (3) recommendations to improve the ability of inner city and minority agents to market property and casualty insurance. Permits the Secretary to use data collection contractors and statistical agents. Requires the Secretary to compile data annually for each MSA for all insurers either subject to or exempt from this Act. Provides civil penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to study and report to certain congressional committees on: (1) the feasibility and utility of collecting information on specified characteristics of insurance applicants and the reasons for their rejection; and (2) actions by insurers to meet the property and casualty insurance needs of low- and moderate-income and minority neighborhoods, and the small businesses located in such neighborhoods."
