    "text": "Guam War Restitution Act - Amends the Organic Act of Guam to apply this Act to Guamanians who did not meet the one-year time limitation for filing of death or personal injury claims specified in a certain Act or who suffered other compensable injuries if such Guamanians, their heirs, or next of kin meet the eligibility, time limitation for filing, and other criteria set forth in this Act. Defines \"compensable injury\" as one of the three following categories of injury incurred during, or as a result of, World War II: (1) death; (2) personal injury; or (3) forced labor, forced march, or internment. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to render final decisions concerning claims for awards and benefits under this Act. Sets forth eligibility requirements. Makes awards available to Guamanians who personally received the compensable injury or to their heirs or next of kin in claims for death. Makes benefits available to Guamanians who are heirs or next of kin of the decedent Guamanian who received the compensable injury and who died after September 2, 1945. Requires payment of the award or benefit relating to death to be prorated among the heirs or next of kin claiming for the same death, as provided in the Guam probate laws. Establishes the Guam Restitution Claims Fund, the Guam Restitution Trust Fund, and the Guam Restitution Trust Fund Board of Directors. Permits the Board to make disbursements from the Trust Fund only: (1) to sponsor research and public educational activities relating to Guamanian wartime experiences; (2) to disburse funds as benefits to eligible claimants through a revolving fund for purposes such as post-secondary scholarships and first-time home ownership loans; and (3) for administrative expenses. Limits any remuneration on account of services rendered on behalf of any claimant in connection with any claim to five percent of the amount paid on such claim. Prescribes penalties for violations of such limit. Authorizes appropriations."
