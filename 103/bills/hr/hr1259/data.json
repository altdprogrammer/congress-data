Title II: Grant Assistance for Alternative Use Committees - Authorizes the Council to make a grant to any eligible alternative use committee at a defense business facility for: (1) a marketing expert to determine potential market needs that provide diversification and conversion opportunities; (2) an office; and (3) experts to determine the feasibility of diversification and conversion alternatives for such facility. Title III: Displaced Workers - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to authorize certain funds under the Defense Saving Investment Act of 1991 to be made available for the defense conversion adjustment program. Title IV: Export Opportunities - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to require the Export-Import Bank to include in an annual report to the Congress a description of actions taken to support the commercial diversification of industries dependent on defense spending.
