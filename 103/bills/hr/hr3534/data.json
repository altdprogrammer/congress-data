    "text": "Computer Equipment and Technology Export Control Reform Act - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) conduct annual reviews of export controls on computer equipment and technology; (2) increase certain export control thresholds if warranted by the review; and (3) report review findings to the Congress and the Computer Systems Technical Advisory Committee. Exempts from license requirements for export or reexport to any controlled country digital computers valued at less than $5,000. Directs the Secretary to: (1) identify specified items that will be installed for end-use outside the United States; and (2) publish in the Federal Register the name and specified license requirements for exports to a proliferation end-user (any entity engaged in the design, development, or production of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missiles which is located in a country that is not party to an agreement, to which the United States is a party, to limit the spread of such weapons and activities). Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a license applicant to supply information about proliferation-related activities of an end-user, as a condition of granting a license for export of goods or technology to such end-user, unless the Secretary has: (1) identified the end-user's country as engaged in proliferation activities; or (2) determined there is a specific risk that the exports will be diverted to a country for use in such activities."
