Requires the Plan to: (1) foster local network access and service programs; (2) develop projects and technologies in the fields of education, health care, libraries, and government information access; (3) provide funds for network services to connect with Internet; and (4) provide related personnel training. Authorizes FY 1994 through 1996 appropriations. Requires the Plan to: (1) specify the research and development activities in support of applications and to ensure network security and privacy; (2) specify applications for education at all levels; (3) specify applications for health care, including clinical information systems, information dissemination, and health delivery systems and population data sets; (4) specify applications for libraries, including digital libraries, prototype development, and remote-sensing data base development; and (5) specify applications for public access to Federal, State, and local government information. Authorizes FY 1994 through 1998 appropriations. (Sec. 4) Redefines the assessment responsibilities of the high-performance computing and applications committee (currently the high-performance computing advisory committee). (Sec. 5) Revises provisions regarding the National Research and Education Network Program (currently the National Research and Education Network) to: (1) set forth test bed network characteristics and restrictions; and (2) limit fund use to commercial (non-Federal) entities and systems whenever feasible. (Sec. 6) Subjects procurements of $25,000 or more under the Act to the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act. (Sec. 7) Reduces FY 1994 authorizations of appropriations for Program activities of: (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and (2) the Department of Energy. (Sec. 8) Subjects procurements under the Act to: (1) the prohibition (and contract ineligibility) against the fraudulent use of \"Made in America\" labels; and (2) the provisions of the Buy American Act. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to report to the Congress concerning any related non-domestic purchases. Expresses the sense of the Congress that grant recipients should purchase American-made equipment and products. (Sec. 9) Terminates the Act on October 1, 1998, except for title II and section 305 which shall terminate on October 1, 1996."
