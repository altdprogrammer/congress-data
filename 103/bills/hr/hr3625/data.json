    "text": "GSP Renewal and Reform Act of 1993 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to revise provisions for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Grants the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) the authority to extend preferences. (This authority is currently the President's.) Requires the USTR to certify that a country meets requirements for beneficiary developing country status before the President may make such a designation. Bars countries with free trade agreements with the United States from such designation. Includes compliance with internationally recognized worker rights and enforcement of environmental protection standards as conditions for such designation. Requires the USTR (rather than the President) to list articles to be considered for designation. Makes an article ineligible if it has been made under conditions that violate specified internationally recognized worker rights. Revises limitations on preferential treatment. Requires the USTR to withdraw or suspend duty-free treatment for any article that no longer meets specified requirements. Provides for petitions by any interested person alleging article or country noncompliance, USTR investigations, and judicial review of removal of articles or withdrawal of designations as beneficiary developing countries. Sets forth competitive need limitations. Extends to July 4, 2003, the termination date for GSP duty-free treatment. Requires general reports on GSP by the USTR, annual reports by the Secretary of Labor on the status of internationally recognized worker rights within each beneficiary developing country, and a special joint report by the USTR, the Secretaries of Commerce and of Labor, and the Comptroller General. Requires training on international labor standards for Labor Reporting Officers for U.S. Embassies and for members of certain special committees created by the USTR. Adds a fourth Deputy USTR. Establishes a Bureau of Trade-Related Standards."
