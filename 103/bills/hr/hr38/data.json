Requires the Secretary, in consultation with local tribal leaders, to: (1) protect religious and cultural sites in the Area; and (2) provide access to such sites by Indian peoples for traditional cultural and customary uses. Authorizes the Secretary to permit timber harvesting for commercial purposes as long as it is compatible with the Area's purposes. Requires preparation of a transportation plan to provide for the most efficient use of existing roads and trails, including a system for dispersed recreation which minimizes its impact on significant archaeological and religious sites. Provides for recreational facilities within the Area and a visitor center. Authorizes the Secretary to permit a utility corridor for high power electric transmission lines and scientific investigations. Allows the Secretary to designate zones where, and establish periods when, activities otherwise permitted in the recreation area will not be permitted for reasons of public safety, administration, fish and wildlife management, protection of archaeological or cultural resources, or public use. Prohibits the issuance of any mining location or claim patents after May 30, 1991, with respect to the Area. Permits any party deprived of property rights by such prohibition to file a compensation claim against the United States in the U.S. Claims Court. Withdraws lands within the Area from U.S. mining, mineral leasing, and related laws. Directs the Secretary to expedite a program to determine the validity of all unpatented mining claims within the Area. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) use mineral materials from within the Area for public purposes; and (2) evaluate adjoining lands for possible inclusion in the Area. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with local tribal leaders and the National Park Service, to submit recommendations to the Congress with respect to future boundaries for the Area. Permits lands within the recreation area that are owned by the State of New Mexico or a political subdivision to be acquired only by donation or exchange. Authorizes appropriations."
