Directs the President to use 20 percent of the aggregate amount of foreign assistance allocated each fiscal year for a foreign country to make loans to enable the country to purchase U.S. pollution control products and services and for administrative expenses. Makes such requirement inapplicable if a country assures compliance with pollution control standards and promotes protection of the local environment from damaging industrial practices. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors of each international financial institution to oppose proposed lending unless the Secretary of State determines that: (1) the borrowing country assures compliance with pollution control standards that will protect local environments from damaging industrial practices; or (2) the lending will support an industrial program that has the potential to adversely affect air or water quality or involves hazardous or solid wastes but is designed to protect the environment from damaging industrial practices."
