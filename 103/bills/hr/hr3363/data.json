Limits judicial review to habeas corpus. Creates a separate offense and penalty for an alien smuggler who seriously injures or jeopardizes the life of an alien. Extends penalties to persons who contract to bring illegal labor. Treats smuggling as an aggravated felony. Expands Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forfeiture authority to include any real or personal property used or intended to be used to smuggle aliens, or that constitutes, is derived from, or traceable to such activities. Exempts property used without the owner's consent or knowledge, or not to his or her benefit. Amends Federal law to authorize INS wiretaps for alien smuggling investigations. Brings alien smuggling operations under the purview of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provisions. Title II: Asylum - Revises asylum procedures. Sets forth mandatory and discretionary conditions for granting provisional asylum. States that asylum applications shall be determined by specially trained asylum officers. Terminates an alien's claim for failure to appear at the application provisional asylum hearing. Title III: Inspections - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish specified numbers of preinspection stations at foreign airports identified as last departure points for the greatest numbers of U.S.-arriving passengers and at those with the greatest numbers of U.S.-arriving undocumented aliens (and to assign additional immigration officers at such airports without preinspection stations); and (2) establish an expedited inspection process for U.S. citizens returning by air from abroad. Revises the pilot visa waiver program to: (1) make it permanent; (2) repeal certain paperwork requirements; (3) subject participants to exclusion or deportation without appeal (except for an asylum claim); and (4) require carriers to distribute program information to passengers. Provides for the training of airline personnel in detection of fraudulent documents. Authorizes the Attorney General to reduce, refund, or waive the fine for bringing illegal aliens into the United States if: (1) a carrier followed prescribed screening procedures; or (2) other justifiable circumstances exist. Title IV: Authorization of Appropriations for the Immigration and Naturalization Service - Authorizes appropriations for the Border Patrol."
