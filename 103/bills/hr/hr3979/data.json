    "text": "Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Reform Act of 1994 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require the court, in the case of specified offenses under the Controlled Substances Act or the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, to impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines established by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at sentencing that the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person and that the defendant: (1) does not have more than one criminal history point under the Commission's Guidelines Manual; (2) did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense; (3) was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others (as determined under the Manual) in the offense; and (4) has provided to the Government all information the defendant has concerning the offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan (but specifies that the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide shall not preclude or require a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement). Authorizes the Commission to make such amendments as necessary to harmonize the sentencing guidelines and policy statements with, and promulgate policy statements to assist in the application of, this Act. Directs the Commission to promulgate or amend sentencing guidelines with respect to cases where statutory minimum sentences would otherwise apply to carry out the purposes of this Act so that the lowest sentence in the guideline range is not less than two years in those cases where a five-year minimum would otherwise apply. Provides that, for purposes of provisions regarding modification of an imposed term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the Commission under specified circumstances, with respect to a prisoner the court determines has demonstrated good behavior while in prison, the changes in sentencing made as a result of this Act shall be deemed changes in such a sentencing range."
