Requires non-Federal cost sharing for research and development programs and demonstration projects. Exempts highly innovative technology programs from such requirement. (Sec. 110) Authorizes FY 1995 through 1998 appropriations. Limits related authorizations of appropriations for each of such fiscal years for Energy Supply Research and Development activities. Title II: Fusion Energy Research Program - Directs the Secretary to carry out a Fusion Energy Research Program consisting of activities related to: (1) magnetic fusion energy technology; (2) alternative fusion concepts; and (3) the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). (Sec. 204) Directs the Secretary to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for studies of: (1) fusion technologies; and (2) other energy sources, including deuterated metal. (Sec. 206) Directs the Secretary to study the advantages and disadvantages (including cost estimates) of siting ITER within or outside the United States. (Sec. 208) Authorizes FY 1995 through 1997 appropriations for programs of fusion energy and alternative energy research. Authorizes specified appropriations through FY 2000 for the Tokamak Physics Experiment from the Fusion Energy Research Program. Provides no funds for ITER, nor for any magnetic fusion facility other than ITER and related facilities, and the Tokamak Physics Experiment. Stipulates that this prohibition shall not apply to the design or engineering of fusion materials irradiation test facilities. Title III: High Energy and Nuclear Physics - Department of Energy High Energy and Nuclear Physics Authorization Act of 1994 - Authorizes FY 1996 through 1999 appropriations for Department of Energy programs of: (1) high energy physics; and (2) nuclear physics. Limits related major construction projects. (Sec. 304) Directs the Secretary to enter into negotiations with the European organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) concerning U.S. participation in the Large Hadron Collider project. (Sec. 305) Requires the Secretary to submit an operating plan to the appropriate committees. (Sec. 306) Directs the Secretary to contract for an independent review of the high energy and nuclear physics programs. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to combine the Nuclear Engineering Research and Education program, the University Research Reactor program, and the University Reactor Fuel Assistance program into a new University Radiation Science and Technology program as a separate part of the University and Science Education program. Authorizes FY 1995 through 1997 appropriations. (Sec. 403) Requires an annual foreign participation report. (Sec. 403 (sic)) Prohibits financial assistance awards without a prior merit review process."
