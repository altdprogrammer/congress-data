    "text": "Health Insurance Fairness Act of 1993 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXI, Health Plan Standards. Prohibits an individual health plan, and any person which issues such a plan, from denying, limiting, or conditioning coverage of benefits for an individual, or varying premiums charged, based on the individual's health status or claims experience, except that plans may, for a limited period, exclude coverage of services related to treatment of a preexisting condition. Sets forth similar prohibitions with respect to group health plans. Outlines general requirements for health plans issued to small employers, as well as requirements related to restrictions on rating practices. Requires individual and group plans to be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or approved by a State regulatory program before such plans may be issued. Requires the Secretary to establish specific standards that incorporate the requirements of this Act for individual and group health plans. Provides for establishment of a toll-free telephone information system to: (1) handle the receipt and disposition of consumer complaints regarding plan compliance with applicable standards; and (2) provide information to small employers about insurers that offer health plans meeting such standards. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on issuers of plans that do not meet applicable standards established under this Act. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of such tax. Requires the General Accounting Office to study and report to the Congress on the impact of the standards for rating practices for small group health insurance on the availability and price of insurance offered to small employers."
