Expands the list of eligible students to include those lawfully admitted to the Unitedd States to pursue courses in higher education (currently, only U.S. citizens or those lawfully admitted for permanent residence are permitted). Allows others to receive instruction at the School on a cost-reimbursable, space-available basis, with funds received to be used to maintain and operate the School. Provides identical authority for the Commandant of the United States Air Force Institute of Technology, with the approval of the Secretary of the Air Force."
