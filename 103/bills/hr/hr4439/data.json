Limits the Federal share of the cost of all such rehabilitation activities. Extends to 40 years from July 1, 1995, the repayment period for the construction and rehabilitation costs of such project which are assigned to the irrigation project's users. Provides the rates of assessable charges after such date based upon land acreage irrigated. Allows such charges to be periodically amended by the Secretary of the Interior. Authorizes additional appropriations for the project due to fluctuations in construction costs. Requires appropriate amendment of the contract between the Secretary and the Belle Fourche irrigation district to reflect changes made by this Act."
