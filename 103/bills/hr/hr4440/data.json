Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the content of the Plan; (2) performance measures; (3) goals; and (4) the content of the Report. Requires a District management employee who is designated in such Report as being directly responsible for the achievement of one or more performance measurement goals: (1) the majority of whose goals in such Report does not achieve a designation of at least an acceptable level of performance to be either removed from employment by the District or demoted to a nonmanagerial position; (2) all of whose goals in such Report do not achieve a designation of at least an acceptable level of performance to not receive any increase in pay for the subsequent year, including but not limited to merit increases, cost-of-living adjustments, and promotions; and (3) the majority of whose goals in such Report do not achieve a designation of at least a superior level of performance to not receive a promotion or performance bonus during the subsequent year. Allows additional limitations and regulations to be applied to such promotions, performance bonuses, and increases in pay. Requires the District, subject to the approval of the Office of Management and Budget, to amend its management and personnel laws and regulations to be in conformance with this Act. Directs the General Accounting Office to audit the Performance Accountability Reports of the District, including the District's compliance with the personal accountability provisions in this Act."
