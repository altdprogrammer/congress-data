    "text": "National Environmental-Economic Recovery Act of 1994 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to make a grant to the IRCA (Industrial Resource Consultants of America) Foundation to establish a facility meeting specified criteria, including: (1) electric energy production from solid wastes; (2) location in a depressed community; (3) provision of electricity and steam to energy intensive industry customers at specified discounted market rates; and (4) acquisition of a continuing supply of feedstock to sustain maximum operational capability through long-term contracts with governmental sources. Requires customers of such facility to reinvest a specified percentage of resultant savings in either capital investments or increased employment. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on whether additional grants should be forthcoming based upon the following considerations: (1) increased employment resulting from the relocation of energy intensive industry; (2) effective disposal of solid wastes; and (3) easier, less expensive energy production."
