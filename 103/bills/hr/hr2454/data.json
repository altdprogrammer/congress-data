    "text": "Procurement Efficiency Act of 1993 - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to require the Secretary of Commerce to establish a computerized data base regarding procurements to be conducted by executive agencies and subcontracts to be awarded pursuant to those procurements. Requires each executive agency to make procurement records readily available to other agencies. Increases the small purchase threshold. Requires executive agencies to include citations of specific statutory authority in regulations governing procurement. Provides for a representative of the Small Business Administration (SBA) on the Cost Accounting Standards Board. Sets forth requirements for the transmittal of proposed rules, including rules related to procurement, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA. Authorizes the Chief Counsel to issue a statement of opposition to such rules. Requires heads of executive agencies, in the case of procurements for which a notice is not required, to submit to the Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy, before issuing a procurement solicitation, the justification for not furnishing the notice. Directs the Administrator to review such justifications at least once every five years to determine their continued appropriateness."
