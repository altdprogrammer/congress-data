Allows such a statute to contain other offsetting provisions that reduce spending or non-emergency appropriations for the designated emergency. Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or joint resolution containing an emergency designation, if the legislation provides an appropriation for any other item or matter."
