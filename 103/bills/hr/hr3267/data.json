Title II: Work Hours - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require overtime to be paid at two times the regular hourly rate (currently, one- and one-half times). Reduces the regular 40-hour workweek to a 30-hour workweek. Title III: Wages - Establishes the minimum wage at $7 an hour. Title IV: Tax Incentives for Full Employment - Expresses the sense of the Congress that appropriate tax incentives should be provided to businesses that hire new employees, create new jobs, provide ongoing education and training for their employees, provide child care arrangements for their employees, establish health care plans for their employees, and undertake research and development. Title V: Entitlement Programs - Expresses the sense of the Congress that individuals who receive assistance under any Federal entitlement program should seek to obtain employment providing livable wages and, where appropriate, affordable child care arrangements."
