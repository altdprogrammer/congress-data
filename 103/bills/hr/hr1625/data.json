Prohibits any medical malpractice liability action from being brought in any State court unless there has been an initial resolution under an alternative dispute resolution system. Requires a pre-trial settlement conference, before the trial of any medical malpractice liability action, where each party must present a settlement offer. Sets limits on damages and attorney's fees. Provides a defendant charged with negligence a complete defense if the appropriate practice guideline was followed. Amends title XI (General Provisions) of the Social Security Act to set aside funds for practice guidelines. Sets forth requirements for alternative dispute resolution systems."
