Requires: (1) each licensed dealer to post conspicuously at his or her place of business a copy of such provision in block letters that are not less than one inch in height; and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that such provision appears on the form required to be obtained by a licensed dealer from a prospective transferee. Sets penalties for violations of this Act."
