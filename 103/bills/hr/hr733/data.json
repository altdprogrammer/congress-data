Requires solicitations made in writing to: (1) be presented in readily understandable language; (2) be located in a conspicuous place; and (3) appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast with other printed matter on the solicitation. Requires solicitations made through audio communication to be clearly audible and in language readily understandable. Requires solicitations made through visual communication to: (1) appear in lettering of sufficient size to be easily read by the viewer; (2) be shown against a background which does not impair the legibility of the communication; and (3) remain in view for a period sufficient to enable the viewer to read the communication. Describes the information to be included in financial reports of organizations which solicit contributions by mail. Requires such organizations to furnish the Postal Service any information it may require to assure compliance with this Act. Describes the types of organizations to which this Act does not apply.
