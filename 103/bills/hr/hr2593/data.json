Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) minimum standards of conduct (good faith, due care, and limited fiduciary duty) for each party to a franchise agreement; (2) a prohibition against requiring the inclusion of a franchise agreement term or condition which violates this Act or relieves a person from a duty or liability under this Act; (3) a prohibition against the waiver from compliance under this Act; (4) legal actions brought by persons injured or damaged by a violation of this Act; (5) the right to arbitration or mediation in lieu of a legal action; and (6) the obligation to comply with all applicable State franchising laws to the extent not inconsistent with this Act."
