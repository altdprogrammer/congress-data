Reduces the number of benefit weeks available during such extended period after October 2, 1993, to seven or 13, as applicable. Modifies the final phase-out period for continuation of claims. Repeals provisions which allow certain claimants who have exhausted benefits to choose EUC benefits in lieu of regular State benefits at the beginning of a new benefit year. Amends the Social Security Act to require the State agency administering the State unemployment law to establish and use a system of worker profiling of all new claimants for regular compensation to: (1) identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular compensation and will need job search assistance services; (2) refer identified claimants to reemployment services available under State or Federal law; and (3) collect follow-up information on such services and employment outcomes. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report to the Congress on such profiling system. Makes a technical amendment to Unemployment Trust Fund provisions. Extends a reporting date for an advisory council on unemployment compensation. Provides for a temporary increase in the sponsorship period for aliens under the supplemental security income program. Provides for an extension of the program of emergency unemployment compensation benefits for railroad workers."
