    "text": "Public Lands Corps Act of 1993 - Establishes a Public Lands Corps in the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to carry out authorized conservation, restoration, and rehabilitation projects on public lands or Indian lands. Requires the Corps to consist of men and women between the ages of 16 and 25 with high school diplomas or the equivalent. Authorizes the Secretaries to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with any qualified youth or conservation corps to perform the projects. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) preferred project characteristics; and (2) provision of facilities, services, and supplies and establishment of conservation centers for project programs. Authorizes the Secretaries to provide for the placement of qualified college students or recent college graduates as Resource Assistants in Federal land managing agencies to carry out research or other technical functions. Declares that the purposes of the Resource Assistant Program are: (1) to augment the work force of the Federal land managing agencies through more extensive use of college students and recent college graduates; and (2) to enhance exposure to the conservation agency work place as a potential career. Directs the agency to implement the Program through existing nonprofit organizations if they can provide an appropriate level and quality of program. Requires participating nonprofit organizations to contribute 25 percent of the total costs of each Program participant recruited and placed through that organization. Applies provisions of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (the Act) relating to living allowances, terms of service, educational benefits or awards, and nondisplacement to participants in the Public Lands Corps and Resource Assistant Program. Authorizes the Secretaries to pay up to 75 percent of the costs of any project carried out on public lands by a qualified youth or conservation corps. Permits the remaining 25 percent of such costs to be provided from nonfederal sources in the form of funds, services, materials, or equipment. Prohibits cost sharing in the case of such project carried out on Indian lands. Authorizes appropriations."
