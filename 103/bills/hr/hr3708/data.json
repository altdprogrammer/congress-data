(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and submit a new comprehensive general management plan for the Site to specified congressional committees. (Sec. 103) Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring any lands or interests in lands contaminated with hazardous substances that would require removal or remedial action at the expense of the United States. Directs the Secretary to take steps to obtain cost recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) for any funds of the National Park Service expended on removal or remedial action with respect to contamination within the Site. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to preserve the collection of railroad equipment (including locomotives and rolling stock) present at the Site as of enactment of this Act. Limits the number of locomotives operating at the Site to the number operating as of June 22, 1994. Prohibits Federal funds from being expended for access between the Site and any structure that is privately owned or operated for profit. Requires the Secretary to preserve the artifact collection and archival materials located at the Site. Authorizes the Secretary to provide a regular excursion from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Moscow, Pennsylvania. Prohibits the Secretary from expending funds of the National Park Service for the restoration or maintenance of tracks, bridges, or tunnels outside the Site, except certain funds appropriated before November 15, 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) pay customary and appropriate track usage fees; and (2) provide additional annual excursions if no such excursion is longer than 60 miles one way. Sets forth user and interpretive fee provisions. (Sec. 105) Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area - Amends Federal law to change the map reference for the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area with respect to its boundary. Title III: Civil War Battlefield of Corinth, Mississippi - Corinth, Mississippi, Battlefield Act of 1994 - Authorizes the Secretary to acquire by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange such lands or interests as the Secretary deems necessary for the construction of an interpretive center to commemorate and interpret the 1862 Civil War Siege and Battle of Corinth. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) construct, operate, and maintain on the property so acquired a center for the interpretation of the Siege and Battle of Corinth and associated historical events; and (2) mark sites associated with the Siege and Battle of Corinth National Historic Landmark if such sites are determined by the Secretary to be protected by State or local governmental agencies.
