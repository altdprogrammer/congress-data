Requires the Council to meet not less than once and, if the Chair determines necessary, up to four times each year (currently, at the call of the Chair and not less than once each three months). Includes among requirements for State plans (in order to receive allotments) coordination and cooperation among bordering States with respect to areas in which logical geographic groupings across State borders would be appropriate (currently, among States that share any standard metropolitan statistical area). Authorizes appropriations. Directs the General Accounting Office to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on the duplication of Federal emergency medical services and trauma activities."
