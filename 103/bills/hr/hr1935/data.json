Provides additional funding for vitamin A supplementation and fortification programs and iodine and iron supplementation and fortification programs for pregnant women. Directs the Agency for International Development, during FY 1994 through 1996, to ensure that a specified amount in local currencies made available under foreign assistance programs is used to provide training, compensation, and other support for maternal and child health workers in developing countries. Authorizes appropriations. Reduces funding for military assistance programs during such fiscal years in order to provide funding for this Act without increasing the foreign assistance budget."
