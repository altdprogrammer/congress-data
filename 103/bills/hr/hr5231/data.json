    "text": "Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to utilize the resources of the Presidio in California to provide for and support programs and activities that foster research, education, or demonstration projects and that relate to the environment, energy, transportation, international affairs, arts and cultural understanding, health, and science. Grants the Secretary authority to: (1) negotiate and enter into specified interagency agreements and leases for the use of property within the Presidio; and (2) retain the proceeds from leases under this Act and from concession and other use authorizations and services provided by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area for five years or until the leased property is transferred to the Presidio Trust (established by this Act). Establishes within the Department of the Interior the Presidio Trust to manage the leasing, maintenance, rehabilitation, repair, and improvement of property within the Presidio which is transferred to the Trust by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to transfer to the Trust, subject to specified requirements, a leasehold in the Letterman-LAIR complex, Fort Scott, Main Post, Cavalry Stables, Presidio Hill, Wherry Housing, East Housing, the structures at Crissy Field, and such other properties within the Presidio as the Secretary and the Trust deem appropriate. Requires the Trust to obtain such competition as is practicable in the circumstances, maintain liaison with the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Advisory Commission, and meet with the Commission at least annually. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits an entity from expending funds appropriated pursuant to this Act unless it complies with the Buy American Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that only American-made equipment and products should be purchased by entities receiving financial assistance under this Act. Requires the head of each Federal agency to notify each such recipient of this congressional statement. Provides that if a court or Federal agency determines that any person intentionally affixed a \"Made in America\" label to any product sold or shipped to the United States that is not made in the United States, such person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract made with funds provided under this Act."
