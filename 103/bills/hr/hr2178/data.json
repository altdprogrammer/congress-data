(Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to waive mandatory registration statement filing requirements, or the payment of a fee, for any person not domiciled in the United States who solely offers hazardous materials for transportation from a place outside of the United States to the United States if the country in which such person is domiciled does not require U.S. domiciliaries to file such statements, or to pay such fee, when making such an offer. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to make grants to Indian tribes for the development of emergency response plans with respect to hazmat transportation through Indian lands. Requires States or Indian tribes receiving such grants to ensure that such emergency planning is coordinated with emergency plans conducted by adjacent States and Indian tribes. (Sec. 106) Requires the Secretary to make sure that the training requirements of hazmat employees with respect to the safe hazmat transportation, and emergency response to accidents, do not duplicate Department of Labor and Environmental Protection Agency regulations. (Sec. 107) Requires States, local governments, or Indian tribes that levy fees in connection with hazmat transportation to comply with certain disclosure requirements. (Sec. 108) Changes from annual to biennial the Secretary's periodic comprehensive hazmat transportation report to the President. (Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary to ensure that the National Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems Program addresses the use of intelligent vehicle-highway system technologies to promote hazmat transportation safety. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for the promotion of certain emergency response information technologies. (Sec. 110) Requires the Secretary to issue final regulations under specified dockets concerning: (1) crashworthiness protection requirements for tank cars; and (2) detection and repair of cracks, pits, corrosion, lining flaws, thermal protection flaws, and other defects of tank car tanks. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary to study the existing practices regarding the placement of cars on trains, with particular attention to the placement of hazmat cars. (Sec. 112) Requires the Secretary to amend Federal regulations on hazmat transportation and motor carrier safety to prohibit the driver of a motor vehicle transporting hazardous materials in commerce or of any commercial vehicle from driving it onto a highway-rail grade crossing without sufficient space to drive completely through the crossing without stopping.
