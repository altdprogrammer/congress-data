(Sec. 1002) Revises competition requirements, among other changes prohibiting purchase or contract class considerations by subject agencies in determining whether the exclusion of a particular source of covered items from competition in procurements to establish alternative sources of supply will result in reduced costs and increased competition or be in the interest of national defense. (Sec. 1003) Revises certain qualifying circumstances for award of contracts between $100,000 and $1 million under noncompetitive procedures. (Sec. 1011) Revises solicitation requirements, among other changes requiring the head of a subject agency to: (1) include cost or price as a factor to be considered in evaluating competitive proposals; and (2) disclose certain information to offerors on the importance of other evaluation factors in relation to cost and price. (Sec. 1012) Relocates provisions concerning purchase option evaluation. (Sec. 1013) Modifies notice requirements, providing, among other changes, for notice by electronic means. (Sec. 1014) Provides, under certain conditions, for: (1) debriefings furnishing unsuccessful offerors certain basic information on the contract award; (2) protest files affording offerors reasonable access in protests to the Comptroller General (CG); and (3) award of multiple contracts for the same supply or service. (Sec. 1016) Authorizes the head of a subject agency to: (1) take certain actions, such as issuing a new solicitation or terminating a contract, if, in connection with a protest, a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with the law; and (2) pay certain costs involved in the protest, including reasonable attorney's fees, subject to prescribed limitations. (Sec. 1021) Eliminates: (1) certain restrictions on cost and incentive contracts; and (2) annual reports by DOD advocates for competition. Part II: Civilian Agency Acquisitions - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA) to make changes similar to those in part I above with respect to civilian agencies. Provides for: (1) solicitations for contracts to be awarded using sealed bid procedures; (2) multiyear contracts for the acquisition of property and services; and (3) severable contracts for procurement of services for periods crossing fiscal years. Part III: Acquisitions Generally - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (OFPPA) to: (1) require establishment of policies and procedures for encouraging the consideration of past contract performance in selecting contractors; (2) require the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (Administrator) to prescribe for executive agencies guidance regarding such consideration; (3) repeal certain congressional reporting requirements on executive agency contract competition; and (4) direct the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) to promulgate regulations to discourage the use of nonstandard contract clauses on a repetitive basis. Subtitle B: Truth in Negotiations - Part I: Armed Services Acquisitions - Amends Federal law (Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA)) to revise cost or pricing data requirements to: (1) repeal the sunset date for the requirement that offerors submit cost or pricing data for prime contracts above the $500,000 threshold (thus making it permanent); (2) provide for periodic inflation adjustments in such threshold; and (3) make changes in exceptions to data submission requirements. (Sec. 1204) Provides for consistent time references with respect to when an agreement on the price of a prime contract is effective for purposes related to contract price reductions because of defective data. Part II: Civilian Agency Acquisitions - Amends FPASA to replace requirements governing submission of cost or pricing data and commercial pricing for supplies with requirements similar to those under TINA (and the changes made above by this subtitle to TINA) governing submission of such data. Subtitle C: Research and Development - Extends the competition requirement for awards of DOD research and development (R&D) grants and contracts to nonprofit organizations other than federally funded research and development centers.
