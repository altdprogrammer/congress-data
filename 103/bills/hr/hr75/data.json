Provides that if the President determines that a balanced budget is not feasible, and submits written reasons in support of such determination, then the President may submit two budgets, one in compliance and one in deficit. Title II: Amendment to Congressional Budget Act of 1974 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require that any budget submitted by the congressional Budget Committees not be in deficit. Provides that if either committee determines that it is infeasible to submit a balanced budget, then such committee may submit two budgets, one of which is in deficit, together with written reasons for such determination. Requires each concurrent resolution on the budget to contain reconciliation directives necessary to implement the resolution. Sets forth requirements for the Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives, if it reports any rule or order providing for the consideration of any concurrent resolution on the budget. Makes it always in order in the Senate to consider a budget resolution consisting of the text of a budget submitted by the President. Title III: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective for the concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1995."
