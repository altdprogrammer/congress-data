    "text": "Youth Homicide Violence Reduction and Mediation Act of 1993 - Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) most directly affected by crime and violence, giving priority to LEAs in urban areas in which the homicide rate for youth has increased by more than five percent in comparison to the preceding year or exceeds the State or national homicide rate for youth by more than seven percent. Requires an LEA, to be eligible to receive a grant, to give assurances that it has developed, or is developing, violence reduction and peer counseling programs as part of the educational curriculum at each school. Permits grants to be used for: (1) training programs for teachers and counseling staff to assist students in the effective use of interpersonal and negotiation skills; (2) counseling programs for victims and witnesses of crime in schools; (3) programs for conflict resolution and peer mediation counseling for students, teachers, and other personnel in regular contact with students at school; and (4) training of parents and community members in techniques that reduce violence and promote mediation. Sets forth application and reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
