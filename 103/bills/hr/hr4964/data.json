Requires the Secretary to ensure that, as a group, such demonstration projects serve urban, rural, and linguistically and culturally diverse clients and include the broadest possible range of services. Specifies other program requirements. Requires the Secretary to make three-year grants (renewable for another three years) to States to carry out such a project. Requires each State conducting a demonstration project to report to the Secretary on: (1) Federal, State, and local administrative policies and laws identified as impediments to the coordination of the delivery of services to needy families with children; and (2) measures the State has taken or intends to take to eliminate or reduce such impediments."
