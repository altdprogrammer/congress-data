Eliminates the program's first-time homebuyer requirement. Requires HOME investment trust funds and specified homeless assistance programs to comply with current housing affordability strategy. Revises program matching requirements. Eliminates the program's independent audit requirement and revises environmental review provisions. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to: (1) permit the use of community development block grant (CDBG) funds for program administrative costs; and (2) suspend certain CDBG requirements for disaster areas. Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to reduce matching grant requirements under the HOPE for homeownership of single family homes program."
