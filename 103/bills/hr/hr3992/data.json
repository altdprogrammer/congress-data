Prohibits, with respect to FY 1995, providing foreign assistance to Russia unless the President certifies to the Congress for that fiscal year that the Russian Government has provided the U.S. Government with a full and accurate accounting of the espionage activities related to the Aldrich Ames case. Requires the President to report to the Congress for each fiscal year: (1) the amount, purpose, and effectiveness of foreign assistance provided to Russia for the preceding fiscal year; (2) a detailed accounting of the amount of foreign assistance appropriated which has not been expended and its status; and (3) an estimate of the total amount of capital exported from Russia during the previous fiscal year. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the U.S. Government should oppose all lending to Russia by the international financial institutions to which the United States is a member unless the Russian Government is in compliance with the conditions for assistance set forth by this Act."
