Conditions grant eligibility on a prison providing: (1) an organized program of manual labor and discipline designed to build character, instill a sense of maturity, promote a positive self-image for offenders, and foster respect for authority; (2) training or vocational education; (3) treatment and counseling to all inmates who are addicted to drugs or alcohol; (4) a corrective therapeutic environment; (5) an agreement that specifies procedures to ensure compliance with boot camp requirements and resentencing by the court to traditional prisons for noncompliance; and (6) a community adjustment phase that begins after an inmate has successfully completed a boot camp prison term which includes specified restrictions. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) application requirements; (2) review of State applications; (3) allocation and distribution of funds; and (4) evaluation (including reports on recidivism rates among participants). Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Boot Camp Option for Nonviolent Drug Offenders - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to authorize the court, in the case of a defendant who is convicted of simple possession of a controlled substance that did not involve violence, to sentence the defendant to incarceration in an intensive confinement center (i.e., a boot camp prison) and make any mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment otherwise required inapplicable (with provision for resentencing the defendant to a term not less than the sentence otherwise required if the defendant is in substantial noncompliance with the requirements of the center)."
