    "text": "Budget Control Act of 1994 - Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit a report to the Congress setting forth projected direct spending targets for FY 1994 through 1997. Makes the initial targets equal to the total outlays for all direct spending (except net interest and deposit insurance) as determined above by OMB, subject to annual adjustment for increases in numbers of direct spending program beneficiaries, and for revenue and emergency legislation. Requires an annual review of direct spending and receipts by the President as part of the budget process. Specifies the information to be included in the President's budget, such as information on target adjustments, and, in appropriate cases such as where direct spending outlays for the current year are projected to exceed applicable targets, a special direct spending message that includes a draft resolution recommending reduced outlays or increased revenues by specified amounts. Sets forth procedures governing congressional consideration of such recommendations (which may not consist of any proposed changes under the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Program), including: (1) requirements for a separate vote in the House of Representatives to increase direct spending targets; and (2) special rules regarding the applicability of budget process and enforcement provisions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) whenever budget resolutions or reconciliation legislation proposing target changes, outlay reductions, or revenue increases are reported. States that: (1) the procedures set forth in this Act shall not apply when the coverage for any fiscal year is less than one-half of one percent of the direct spending target for that year; and (2) the President and the Congress should seriously consider all other alternatives before recommending reductions in means-tested programs. Declares it shall not be in order in the House to consider any general appropriation bill if the President has submitted a special direct spending message until the Congress has adopted a concurrent budget resolution meeting the requirements of this Act."
