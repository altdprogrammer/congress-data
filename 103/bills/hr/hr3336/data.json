    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to require the court, in the case of a conviction for a Federal violent felony, to sentence the defendant to life imprisonment if the defendant has previously been convicted of two other violent felonies. Specifies that this provision shall not be construed to prevent the imposition of the death penalty. Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General to study all military installations selected before the enactment of this Act to be closed pursuant to a base closure law to: (1) evaluate the suitability of any of these military installations, or portions thereof, for conversion into Federal prison facilities; and (2) identify three of them that are most suitable for such conversion. Directs the Secretary to transfer, without reimbursment, jurisdiction over the three installations to the Attorney General for conversion into Federal prison facilities designed to incarcerate persons convicted of a Federal violent felony. Authorizes the Attorney General to accept transfers, upon a space available basis, from overcrowded State prisons of persons previously convicted of a Federal violent felony or who are serving a sentence of more than 20 years."
