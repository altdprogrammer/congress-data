    "text": "War Powers Amendments of 1993 - Amends the War Powers Resolution to permit the introduction of the armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated only: (1) pursuant to a declaration of war by the Congress; (2) in accordance with a specific statutory authorization; (3) to contend with an armed attack on the United States or the armed forces; or (4) under certain circumstances to protect U.S. nationals while evacuating them from a situation that threatens their lives or liberty. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds for any such introduction of the armed forces except as described under this Act. Requires the President to consult with the Congress before the armed forces are introduced into hostilities and before they are introduced into the territory, airspace, or waters of a foreign country: (1) while equipped for combat, except for deployments which relate solely to supply, replacement, repair, or training of such forces; or (2) in which there are already armed forces equipped for combat if such introduction would substantially enlarge the number of armed forces equipped for combat or increase the military capabilities of such forces. Declares that the President must ask Members of Congress for their advice and opinions before the decision is made to introduce the armed forces in order to satisfy the consultation requirement. Directs the President, within 48 hours after the armed forces are introduced into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated, to report to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate on: (1) the circumstances necessitating the introduction; (2) the constitutional and legislative authority under which the introduction took place; and (3) the estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or the involvement of the armed forces. Provides for continuing reports at least every six months. Prohibits funding for continued involvement of the armed forces 60 days after their introduction unless the Congress has provided specific statutory authorization and other conditions have been met. Sets forth expedited congressional procedures for the consideration of a privileged resolution authorizing the introduction of the armed forces into hostilities. Authorizes Members of Congress to bring actions for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief for failures by the President to comply with this resolution. Provides for removal of the armed forces from hostilities by court order if the court finds that this resolution has been violated."
