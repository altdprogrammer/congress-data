Prohibits outlays for that year from exceeding this amount unless the Congress, by a three-fifths roll call vote of each House, authorizes a specific excess of outlays over receipts. Requires a two-thirds roll call vote of each House to increase the public debt. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget to the Congress. Requires a two-thirds roll call vote of the total membership of each House before any bill to increase revenue may become law. Waives these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect. Grants the President the authority to disapprove any appropriation or provision and approval any other appropriation or provision in the same appropriation bill."
