Presents a mandatory six fiscal year timetable for achieving a balanced budget. Permits waiver of these balanced budget requirements (not to exceed a ten percent receipt to outlay deficit) in times of national emergency, but only by roll call vote of three-fourths of the total membership of both Houses. Requires a surplus budget with total Government receipts exceeding outlays by two and one-half percent of Federal indebtedness during the 40 fiscal years following achievement of a balanced budget. Requires that any indebtedness ensuing after an emergency waiver shall be extinguished within three fiscal years of being incurred."
