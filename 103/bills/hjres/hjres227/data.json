Affirms support for the commitment made to the General Assembly by President Bush to make bases and facilities available to the Security Council for multinational training of forces under the UN. Urges the President to consult with specified congressional committees in the course of negotiating an Article 43 agreement. Expresses congressional intent to give prompt consideration to any such agreement. Reaffirms Congress's commitment to the principle that congressional approval of an Article 43 agreement shall have the effect of providing the President with full authority to direct that the U.S. armed forces designated in such agreement be employed as may be necessary to support Security Council decisions."
