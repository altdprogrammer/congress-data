(Sec. 2) Sets forth recommended budgetary levels of Federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and credit activity. (Sec. 3) Sets forth Social Security trust fund revenues and outlays for Senate enforcement purposes. (Sec. 4) Sets forth funding levels for each major functional category. Title II: Budgetary Procedures- Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government should sell assets from time to time; and (2) the amounts realized from such sales will not recur on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit. (Sec. 22) Prohibits consideration of budget resolutions, and amendments thereto, which provide for a reduction in the Social Security surplus. (Sec. 23) Establishes Senate pay-as-you-go enforcement procedures effective through FY 2004. (Sec. 24) Establishes Senate procedures to enforce lower discretionary spending limits than those provided in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings). (Sec. 25) Provides for budgetary adjustments to reflect additional new budget authority or outlays for the Internal Revenue Service compliance initiative activities. (Sec. 26) Provides for adjusting budget authority, outlays, and new entitlement authority if health care reform legislation is reported in the House of Representatives. (Sec. 27) Allows for revised spending allocations and revenue aggregates in the Senate for legislation that increases funding for certain purposes when legislation has been reported that will not, if enacted, increase the deficit for FY 1995 through 1999. Title III: Sense of Congress Provisions - Expresses the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted providing enforceable limits to control the growth of entitlement or mandatory spending. (Sec. 32) Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the following legislation should be enacted: (1) legislation providing enforceable limits to control the growth of entitlement or mandatory spending; (2) amendments to the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 to establish a regular procedure to provide assistance for disasters and other emergencies without adding to the deficits; (3) legislation granting the President expedited rescission authority over appropriations measures. (Sec. 33) Expresses the sense of the Senate on controlling non-Social Security mandatory spending after health care reform legislation is enacted. (Sec. 34) Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to budgetary accounting of health care reform, reimbursing State and local governments for illegal immigration costs, baseline budgeting, and the cost to State and local governments of unfunded Federal mandates. (Sec. 38) Expresses the sense of the Senate regarding closing loopholes in foreign tax provisions, creating targets for the growth in tax expenditures, and the budget authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (Sec. 40) Expresses the sense of the Congress on funding health service delivery and water infrastructure in the Indian Health Service. (Sec. 42) Expresses the sense of the Senate on the minimum allocation program for Federal-aid highways. (Sec. 43) Expresses the sense of the Congress that levels of spending set forth in this resolution regarding the International Affairs budget category include an assumption that the United States will oppose attempts by the Russian Federation to intimidate, use military force, or engage in economic coercion to establish a sphere of influence over the former republics of the Soviet Union, the Baltics, or Central and Eastern European nations. (Sec. 44) Expresses the sense of the Senate on limiting ballistic missile defense (Star Wars) spending."
