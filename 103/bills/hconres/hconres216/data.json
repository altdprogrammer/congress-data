Declares that the President, in U.S. bilateral relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, should: (1) place a high priority on whether article 4 of the Vietnamese constitution and any other articles concerning \"democratic centralism\" and \"the leading role of the Communist party\" are repealed, whether article 69 (which strictly controls all religious activity is eliminated), and whether the Vietnamese Government and the Communist Party of Vietnam make formal commitments to permit free and fair elections; and (2) assess the progress that has occurred before taking steps to complete full normalization of relations."
