Includes among such conditions that such Government is making significant progress in protecting and facilitating the activities of human rights groups, participating in and otherwise facilitating conflict resolution efforts and the compilation of a list of all those who have been extrajudicially executed or have disappeared, terminating interference in the nonviolent activities of the political opposition, allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoners, and facilitating the protection and reintegration of returnees."
