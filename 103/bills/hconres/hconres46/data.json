Urges the Commission to establish: (1) and oversee a Border Environmental Guaranty Fund to provide financial guarantees for the repayment of debt instruments issued by public and private financial organizations to fund projects to create, replace, or improve the environmental infrastructure in the region; (2) a program to provide for technical assistance and the exchange of personnel for environmental coordination activities between the United States and Mexico; (3) procedures to promote increased public participation and public disclosure relating to public health and environmental issues in the region; and (4) a U.S.-Mexico Border Volunteer Service to work to expand specified activities of the Senior Corps of Retired Executives, provide certain assistance and advice to border area not-for-profit organizations, and promote initiatives aimed at increasing the level of corporate philanthropy among businesses in the region for alleviating public health and environmental problems. Directs the Commission to submit an annual report to both the United States and Mexican Governments regarding its activities."
