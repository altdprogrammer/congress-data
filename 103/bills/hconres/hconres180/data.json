Declares that the United States: (1) should encourage economic, trade, and investment relationships with the countries of the South Pacific; (2) should seek to maintain its diplomatic presence in the South Pacific region; (3) has interests in preserving the natural resources and biodiversity of the region and is uniquely positioned to promote sustainable development; (4) should cooperate closely with regional governments to strengthen sustainable management principles and practices as they apply to the region's fisheries resources; (5) should avail itself of the opportunity for contact with leaders of all South Pacific countries through regular ministerial/cabinet level meetings; and (6) should take an active interest in the proposed Joint Declaration of Cooperation between the United States and certain Pacific Island governments."
