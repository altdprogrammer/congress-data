Declares that the United States should encourage: (1) other nations with significant markets for Atlantic bluefin tuna to prohibit their importation from harvesting nations which do not comply with the conservation and management recommendations of the Commission; and (2) the Commission to adopt recommendations authorizing the use of discretionary trade actions as enforcement against nations that undermine the effectiveness of such conservation and management recommendations."
