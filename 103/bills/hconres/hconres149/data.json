Applauds the Clinton Administration's emergency assistance to the United Nations/Organization of American States (OAS) effort and expresses hope that such aid is directed through President Aristide. Declares that United Nations and OAS sanctions should be reinstated against Haiti given the existence of human rights violations which constitute noncompliance with the Governors Island Accord. Expresses the sense of the Congress that no U.S. aid should be provided for training or technical assistance of Haitian military and police unless it is done in accordance with plans established by the constitutional government in consultation with the international community."
