Endorses a complete halt to the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, including a mutual verifiable freeze on the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons. Declares that Congress would welcome an international agreement based on specified principles providing for: (1) the staged disarmament of all nations until nonthreatening force levels are reached under effective international inspection and control; and (2) concurrent agreements providing methods for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the creation of a United Nations police force. Requests the President to: (1) transmit copies of this resolution to the heads of government of all nations and to invite them to participate in negotiations on such an international agreement; and (2) report to Congress on the steps taken respecting this resolution and the responses received."
