Requires such committees to submit their recommendations to the Committees on the Budget of their respective Houses. Requires the Committees on the Budget to report to the House and the Senate a reconciliation bill or resolution or both carrying out all such recommendations without any substantive revision. Declares that, in the House of Representatives, no bill or resolution providing new budget authority for FY 1983, or new spending authority first effective in FY 1983 which exceeds the appropriate allocation or subdivision of such new discretionary budget authority or new spending authority shall be enrolled until after Congress has completed action on the second concurrent resolution on the budget. Makes it out of order in either House to consider any bill or resolution or amendment thereto providing new budget authority for FY 1983 or new spending authority first effective in FY 1983 within the jurisdiction of any of its committees unless and until such committee makes the allocations or subdivisions required by the Budget Act. Declares that it is the sense of Congress that if Congress acts to restore fiscal responsibility and reduces projected budget deficits in a substantial and permanent way, then the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee shall reevaluate its monetary targets in order to assure that they are fully complementary to a new and more restrained fiscal policy."
