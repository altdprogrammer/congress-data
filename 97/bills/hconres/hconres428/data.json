Urges the President to: (1) raise the issue of violations of religious freedom at every opportunity; (2) instruct the U.S. representatives to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to work for the establishment of a working group on the elimination of all forms of religious persecution and discrimination; (3) encourage the leaders of other countries to join in condemning all forms of religious persecution and discrimination, to support the establishment of a working group at the United Nations, and to call upon the United Nations to take other specified actions to reduce religious persecution and discrimination; and (4) try to organize a program of action to be taken with respect to governments practicing religious persecution and discrimination."
