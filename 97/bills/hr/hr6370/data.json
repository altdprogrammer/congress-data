Reaffirms U.S. policy toward the Eastern Mediterranean as stated in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Permits the FY 1983 foreign military sales financing program for Turkey or for Greece to exceed the FY 1982 program for that country only if the President makes a specified certification to the Congress. Limits the amount of FY 1983 foreign military sales financing to Zaire. Permits only loan guarantees to be made to Zaire. Prohibits sales credits to Zaire. Prohibits Economic Support Fund assistance to Zaire in FY 1983. Excludes a pro-rata share of fixed base operations costs from the full-cost recoupment requirement of the section of the Arms Export Control Act dealing with sales from U.S. military stocks. Directs the President to grant congressional committees, upon request, access to security assistance surveys conducted by U.S. personnel in foreign countries. (Current law requires the President to grant Congress access only to defense requirement surveys.) Includes within the definition of security assistance surveys: (1) defense requirement surveys; (2) site surveys; (3) general surveys; and (4) engineering assessment surveys. Amends the provision dealing with quarterly reports by the President to the Congress on the estimated number of U.S. personnel abroad to require the estimate to include an estimate of the number of different categories of personnel abroad and an estimate of the number of each category of personnel who were in each foreign country at any time during the quarter. Includes within such report all such personnel in a foreign country in connection with the implementation of: (1) sales and commercial exports under the Arms Export Control Act; or (2) certain assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Authorizes the President to sell defense articles and unclassified defense service publications to a U.S. company for incorporation into end items that will be sold by such company to a friendly foreign country or international organization. Permits such sales only if specified conditions are met. Provides that administrative surcharges for sales of defense articles shall include the recovery of extraordinary expenses incurred by Federal agencies in carrying out such sales. Prohibits the acquisition for the Special Defense Acquisition Fund of any aircraft designed specifically for export which is not in the inventory of the Department of Defense or is in the inventory solely for training purposes.

Authorizes the President to provide free training of foreign military personnel at professional U.S. military schools (other than the Service academies) in accordance with reciprocal programs between U.S. and foreign schools. Increases the authorized appropriations for FY 1983 for peacekeeping operations. Authorizes the President to order the use of Federal agency commodities and services, up to a specified value, for emergency peacekeeping operations. Requires the President to notify the Congress before taking such an action. Revises the limitations on the authority of the President to furnish foreign assistance without regard to the provisions of various Acts. Imposes a ceiling on the amount of sales under the Arms Export Control Act that the President may authorize under such section. Allocates the amount the President may authorize between the funds that the President may make available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act and the funds the President may make available for foreign military sales. Limits the amount of funds that the President may make available under such authority to any one country. Makes the amount higher if the country is the victim of Communist or Communist-supported aggression. Exempts from the congressional prenotification requirements the reprograming of international narcotics control programs or military education and training programs if the reprograming involves less than $50,000 and the programs for that fiscal year were justified to Congress. Amends the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 to change the certification that the President must make to Congress before granting aid to El Salvador. Requires the President to certify that El Salvador's government is: (1) actively engaged in a good faith dialog with all major parties willing to participate in the democratic process to bring about an equitable political solution to hostilities in that country; or (2) unable to proceed with such a dialog because the opposition is unwilling to participate. Directs the President to consult with Congress in making the determinations required in the certification. Requires the President, upon making the first such certification in FY 1983, to also certify to Congress that El Salvador has made good faith efforts to investigate the murders of six U.S. citizens in El Salvador and to bring those responsible to justice. Directs the President to consult with Congress before exercising specified authorities to grant aid to El Salvador. Requires any decision to invoke such authority to take into account the certification criteria established under the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981. Title II: Antiterrorism Assistance - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish antiterrorism assistance for foreign countries. Sets forth the purposes for which antiterrorism activities shall be conducted. Permits training services for antiterrorism to be furnished only within the United States. Limits the amount of time U.S. personnel performing services for a foreign country under the antiterrorism aid program may remain in that country.

Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if the President makes a specified certification to Congress. Requires that the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs be consulted in developing and implementing antiterrorism assistance programs. Prohibits furnishing any antiterrorism assistance until a specified time after the President transmits to the Congress a list of the countries being considered as possible recipients of such assistance for FY 1983. Authorizes Federal agencies to furnish services and commodities, subject to payment in advance, to eligible foreign countries to further the antiterrorism program. Makes the antiterrorism provisions inapplicable to certain information exchange activities of Federal agencies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for antiterrorism assistance. Requires the President to make an annual report to Congress on such assistance. Provides for the administration of the antiterrorism assistance program. Sets forth the expiration date for such assistance.

Amends a specified definition to establish a costing formula for sales of commodities and services provided under the antiterrorism assistance program. Title III: Economic Support Fund - Increases the authorized appropriations for the Economic Support Fund for FY 1983. States that priority consideration should be given in negotiating, planning, and administering economic support programs for countries where significant amounts of illicit narcotics are grown to programs which would stimulate broader development opportunities and strengthen the security of such countries. Increases the authorized appropriations for FY 1983 for the Middle East Special Requirements Fund. Deletes the provisions which earmarked specified amounts for FY 1983 for: (1) Tunisia; (2) Costa Rica; and (3) Nicaragua. Requires consideration to be given to providing assistance to Mozambique. Permits the use of Economic Support Fund assistance for training in South Africa only if the recipients of the training will be able to receive the training in nonsegregated institutions, will be allowed to use all the facilities of those institutions on a racially nondiscriminatory basis, and will not be prohibited from using their training in racially integrated organizations. Provides that any funds not used for such training programs shall be made available for the scholarship program for disadvantaged South African students under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title IV: Development Assistance - Increases the authorized appropriations for FY 1983 for: (1) education and human resources development programs; (2) energy, private voluntary organizations, and selected development activities; (3) international organizations and programs (with specified amounts allocated for certain United Nations funds and programs); and (4) trade and development programs. Extends until September 30, 1983, the agricultural and productive credit and self-help community development programs. Prohibits the use of funds authorized to be appropriated under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for programs or projects benefitting the Palestine Liberation Organization or South West Africa People's Organization. Requires the Secretary of State to report annually to the Congress on the amount of funds spent by U.S. supported international organizations for such programs or projects. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to set a target number of food for development programs for each fiscal year. Directs the President to explain to Congress the reasons for any failure to reach such target. Requires consideration to be given to using the expertise of U.S. nonprofit voluntary agencies and cooperatives in developing and carrying out food for development programs. Requires the agreements entered into under the food for development programs to provide that commodities made available under those agreements or funds generated from the sale of those commodities shall be used to establish rural projects in famine-prone countries. Title V: Other Authorizations - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the authorized appropriations for FY 1983 for international narcotics control. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should give greater priority to international narcotics control as a component of U.S. foreign policy toward the major illicit drug producing nations. Provides that funds made available to carry out the Economic Support Fund programs shall be used for the operating expenses directly attributable to the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of those programs. States that if the operating expenses of the Economic Support Fund's programs for FY 1983 exceeds a specified amount the funds of another agency may be used. Amends the Peace Corps Act to increase the authorized appropriations for FY 1983 for the Peace Corps. Eliminates the ceiling on readjustment allowances for volunteer leaders. Provides for an increase in the readjustment allowances for volunteer leaders that is the same as the increase received by volunteers under an amendment made by the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981. Increases the authorized appropriations for FY 1983 for migration and refugee assistance. Allocates the increase to combat piracy in the Gulf of Thailand. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide assistance to communist countries if the President reports to Congress that making such countries eligible for such assistance is important to U.S. security. (Current law prohibits assistance to such countries unless the President makes certain findings and report to Congress.) Expresses the sense of Congress that up to a specified amount of the development assistance funds available for FY 1983 should be available for development assistance for Haiti. States that such assistance should be provided, to the maximum extent possible, through private and voluntary organizations. Authorizes spending development and military assistance funds for Haiti and extending military sales credits and guarantees to Haiti only if the President makes a specified certification to Congress concerning Haiti. Directs the President to report to Congress six months after such certification on the actions of the Government of Haiti that were consistent with the certification. Prohibits furnishing Economic Support Fund assistance to Haiti until the President has certified to the Congress that Haiti has met certain fiscal performance targets established by the International Monetary Fund.

Authorizes the President to extend such controls beyond a specified date in accordance with certain provisions of such Act.
