    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on the District of Columbia with amendment, H. Rept. 97-102 (Part III)) Title I: Department of State - Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1982 and 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for the Department of State to be used for: (1) administration of foreign affairs; (2) international organizations and conferences; (3) international commissions; and (4) migration and refugee assistance. Limits the amount of any U.S. payment to the United Nations budget to the amount assessed as the U.S. contribution less: (1) 25 percent of the budget for the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People; and (2) 25 percent of the budget for the Special Unit on Palestinian Rights. Makes a specified amount available for an ex gratia payment to Yugoslavia as an expression of U.S. concern for the injuries suffered by a Yugoslav national who was attacked in New York City. Makes available specified amounts for aid in resettling refugees from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Israel. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for payment of the U.S. share of expenses of the science and technology agreements between the United States and Yugoslavia and the United States and Poland. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, and the Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 to authorize appropriations for, respectively, the State Department, the International Communication Agency (ICA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc., to offset fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates occurring after November 30 of the calendar year preceding the enactment of the authorization legislation for such fiscal year (current laws offset fluctuations occurring after November 30 of the preceding fiscal year). Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to transfer from accounts under the heading of administration of foreign affairs to the account set up to offset such fluctuations any amount which exceeds the needs of the approved level of operations because of such fluctuations. Amends the passport provisions to authorize the Secretary of State to set the amount of the fees for issuance of a passport and for executing passport applications. Extends the duration of a passport's validity from five to ten years. Authorizes the Secretary to limit a passport's validity to a shorter period in an individual case or on a general basis pursuant to regulation. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to allow as proof of U.S. citizenship: (1) a passport during its period of validity if such period is the maximum authorized by law; and (2) a Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States. Deletes the limitations under current Federal laws on the authorized appropriations for payment of the U.S. share of the expenses of the: (1) Pan American Institute of Geography and History; (2) Hague Conference on Private International Law and of the International (Rome) Institute for the Unification of Private Law; and (3) Pan American Railway Congress. Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to direct the President to appoint a U.S. representative to the Vienna office of the United Nations. Provides for living quarters for certain U.S. representatives to the United Nations rather than only for the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Credits any payments made by U.S. personnel for such living quarters to the fund used by the Secretary to rent the premises. Provides that the Federal criminal provisions relating to compensation, activities, disqualification, and acts affecting personal financial interests of Federal employees shall not apply to certain private sector representatives on U.S. delegations to international telecommunications conferences. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to limit the duration of any procurement contract for the Department of State or the Foreign Service to five years when: (1) appropriations are available for the first fiscal year and for potential cancellation costs; and (2) the Secretary makes specified determinations. Provides for cancellation of the contract if funds are not available for its continuation. Makes the provisions of the Defense Base Act relating to the compensation for disability or death for persons employed at military bases outside the United States inapplicable with respect to contracts with persons employed by the State Department or the Foreign Service on an intermittent basis. Directs the Secretary to establish an independent Office of Foreign Missions within the Department of State. Authorizes the Director of such Office to: (1) assist Federal, State, and municipal agencies to ascertain the benefits due a foreign mission; (2) provide benefits for or on behalf of a foreign mission; and (3) perform such other functions as the Secretary determines necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to require a foreign mission to obtain benefits from the Director on terms approved by the Secretary or to comply with certain terms, including paying the Director a fee and waiving any recourse against any government authority or employee, as a condition to the performance in the United States of any contract, the acquisition of any real property, or the application for or acceptance of any benefit, if the Secretary determines such actions are necessary to: (1) facilitate relations between the U.S. and a sending state (a state represented by such mission); (2) protect U.S. interests; (3) adjust for costs and procedures of obtaining benefits for U.S. missions abroad; or (4) assist in resolving a dispute affecting U.S. interests. Authorizes the Secretary to require any foreign mission to: (1) notify the Director before such mission acquires or disposes of any real property; and (2) divest itself of or forgo the use of any real property acquired without notice to the Director or exceeding the limits placed on real property available to a U.S. missions in the sending state. Authorizes the Secretary to protect and dispose of any property of a foreign mission which has ceased conducting governmental activities and has not designated a protecting power. Provides for the administration and management of the Office of Foreign Missions. Makes the provisions of this Act applicable to public international organizations. Prohibits compliance with this Act by a foreign mission from being deemed a waiver of any immunity. Prohibits making benefits available to foreign missions contrary to this Act. Extends the privileges and immunities of the Vienna Convention to missions of nonparties to the Convention. Authorizes the President to extend to such missions treatment that is more favorable or less favorable than that provided under the Vienna Convention. Title II: International Communication Agency - International Communication Agency Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1982 and 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for the ICA for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to carry out certain international communication, educational, cultural, and exchange programs.
