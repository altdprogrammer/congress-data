Limits the credit to automobiles manufactured in the United States if the President determines and certifies to the Congress that such limitation does not violate certain international trade agreements. Allows individual taxpayers an income tax credit for five percent of the purchase price of a new principal residence. Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $5,000. Specifies that only one residence of the taxpayer shall be eligible for the credit. Permits an additional ten percent investment tax credit for the purchase of new farm equipment.
