Establishes a ceiling on the quantity of articles which qualify for such duty-free treatment. Permits any interested party to submit a request to the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations that: (1) the aforementioned articles be designated as import sensitive; or (2) such designation be removed. Requires articles subject to certain bilateral or multilateral import restraint agreements and articles subject to specified import relief provisions to be treated as import sensitive articles. Requires the President to report to Congress concerning the economic effect of these amendments on the insular possessions."
