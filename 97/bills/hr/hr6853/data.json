Establishes fines ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 and imprisonment from 30 days to five years, depending on whether the country is in a state of war or persons are being inducted into military service. Provides as a defense to a prosecution for violation of this Act (except its fraud provisions) that such violation was the result of a bona fide religious belief. Establishes penalties for anyone who knowingly uses fraud with intent to interfere with the military or alternative service obligation of another. Provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction."
