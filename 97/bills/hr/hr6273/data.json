Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to allow States to establish procedures to enforce safety standards identical to Federal standards. Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from requiring independent tire dealers and distributors to complete or compile tire registration forms. Requires such dealers to furnish the first purchaser of a tire with a registration form which the purchaser may send directly to the manufacturer of the tire. Directs the Secretary, at the end of the two-year period of the effective date of this Act, to evaluate the effectiveness of the registration procedures. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress before imposing any new requirements. Requires tire manufacturers to reimburse dealers and distributors for reasonable costs incurred with respect to any new requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to issue a public notice of a recall of defective tires."
