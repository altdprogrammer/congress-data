Sets forth the evidentiary and procedural rules for review of a decision by the Board in such Court. Amends Part A (General Provisions) of title XI of such Act to establish the Social Security Court which shall have jurisdiction to review decisions rendered pursuant to benefit entitlement hearings under titles II and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of such Act. Permits the Court to be divided into divisions of one or more judges so that cases may be heard throughout the United States. Requires that Social Security Court proceedings be conducted according to practice and procedural rules prescribed by the Court. Sets forth notice requirements.
