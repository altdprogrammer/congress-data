Declares that no rule shall become effective if: (1) both Houses of Congress adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving it within 90 days of continuous session of Congress; or (2) one House adopts such a resolution within 60 such days and the other House does not disapprove such resolution within 30 days thereafter. Authorizes either House of Congress to adopt a concurrent resolution directing an agency to reconsider and promulgate a rule. Declares that if either House adopts such a resolution and the other House does not disapprove it, the agency rule shall lapse unless the rule is promulgated within a specified period. Requires an agency to conduct a hearing for oral presentations when repromulgating a rule. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for the consideration of resolutions for the disapproval or reconsideration of agency rules. Establishes in each House a Resolution on Regulations Calendar to which any resolutions on rules shall be referred."
