    "text": "Fewer-Mergers, Stronger Small Business Act of 1982 - Imposes an additional income tax on corporations who are parties to a merger involving a large corporate acquisition. Defines \"large corporate acquisition\" as the acquisition during a year of a controlling interest in another corporation if one of the corporation's gross income exceeds $200,000,000 and the other corporation's gross income is at least $10,000,000. Exempts acquisitions of insolvent corporations from such tax. Establishes in the treasury the Small Business Trust Fund. Appropriates to such fund taxes collected from large corporate acquisitions. Specifies that such fund shall be used for the small business innovation research project of the National Science Foundation and to lower the social security payroll tax on employers of 500 or less."
