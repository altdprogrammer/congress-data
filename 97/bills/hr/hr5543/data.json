Limits the total amount payable into the Fund during any fiscal year. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to use specified portions of such funds to: (1) carry out the National Sea Grant College Program; and (2) provide national ocean and coastal resources management and development block grants to each coastal State. Requires such States to report grant allocation and project information, and provide opportunity for public comment before receiving such grants. Sets forth a grant allocation formula based on: (1) actual and future outer continental shelf lease sales, including oil and gas; (2) coastal related energy activities; (3) shoreline mileage; and (4) coastal population. Establishes a minimum grant of one-half of one percent of authorized funds for States having approved coastal management programs. Specifies activities authorized by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (and coastal energy impact program), and living marine and natural resource management projects as eligible uses of block grants. Requires States receiving such grants to submit to the Secretary an assessment of the expenditure of such funds. Directs the Secretary to promulgate implementing regulations."
