    "text": "Clean Air Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Clean Air Act (\"the Act\") to revise stationary source, mobile source, and other provisions of the Act. Title I: Amendments Relating Primarily to Stationary Sources - Fine and Inhalable Particulates - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue air quality criteria and information for inhalable particulates (less than 10 to 15 microns in diameter) within one year of enactment of this Act. Directs the Administrator to propose and promulgate a national primary ambient air quality standard (\"a primary NAAQS\") for inhalable particulates, unless there is no significant evidence that this is requisite to protect public health. Directs the Administrator to determine whether or not fine particulates (less than 3 microns in diameter) should be listed among those air pollutants for which the issuance of air quality criteria is planned. Provides that State implementation plan (SIP) provisions which related to a prior NAAQS and were in effect immediately before the revision or elimination of such NAAQS shall remain in effect until the Administrator determines that an SIP revision has been implemented which takes account of such NAAQS change. Hazardous Air Pollutants - Revises provisions for national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAPs). Directs the Administrator to determine, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, whether or not each of 37 substances (listed in a specified publication of congressional oversight hearings) is a hazardous air pollutant. Requires that each of the 37 substances be included on the NESHAPs list (of substances for which NESHAPs are to be established), unless the Administrator has determined that any of the 37 substances is not a hazardous air pollutant. Requires that the NESHAPs listing determinations for these 37 substances be made within one year of the enactment of this Act. Directs the Administrator, in the case of substances other than those 37 substances, to make determinations within 180 days after receipt of information which indicates that a substance may be a hazardous air pollutant, after notice and opportunity for public hearing. Permits (currently, the Administrator is required) the Administrator to make a new determination in the case of any substance which the Administrator has previously determined not to be a hazardous air pollutant. Requires that any substance which the Administrator determines to be a hazardous air pollutant be included on the NESHAPs list. Directs the Administrator to publish a list of each category of stationary sources which emit in any significant amounts any hazardous air pollutant included on the NESHAPs list. Requires that specified categories be included in the source categories list, and that such list be published 15 months after enactment of this Act for certain categories and 18 months after such enactment for other categories. Directs the Administrator to publish a revised source categories list within one year after any revision in the NESHAPs list. Authorizes the Administrator to revise the source categories list at such other times as may be necessary. Directs the Administrator to publish proposed emission standards for new stationary sources in each source category listed within 30 months of enactment of this Act for certain categories and within 42 months of such enactment for other categories. Directs the Administrator to promulgate such standards within six months after such publication. Directs the Administrator to revise such standards where appropriate following periodic review. Requires such periodic review to be completed within ten years of the date of promulgation of such standards. Provides that such standards shall apply to each hazardous air pollutant on the NESHAPs list which is emitted in significant amounts from sources in such category. Requires that such emission standards (for new stationary sources in each source category listed for NESHAPs purposes) be established at the more stringent of: (1) the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through application of the best system of continuous emission reduction which the Administrator determines is available, taking account of costs, health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements; or (2) the most stringent emission limitation achieved in practice by other sources in the same, or a similar, category. Authorizes the Administrator to distinguish among classes, types, and sizes within categories of sources for purposes of establishing such standards. Sets forth a schedule for completion of specified actions required after enactment of this Act: (1) one year for making the NESHAPs listing determination for the 37 substances; (2) 15 months for publishing the source categories list for certain categories, and 18 months for other categories; (3) 30 months for proposing emission standards for certain source categories, and 42 months for other categories; and (4) six months after such proposal for promulgation of such standards. Provides that no time period under such schedule may be delayed or modified by any petition to the Administrator or by any action brought in any court. Declares that completion of such actions according to such schedule is a nondiscretionary duty of the Administrator. Permits citizen suits against the Administrator in cases of failure or refusal to comply with such schedule. Allows such suits to commence ten days after the plaintiff has given notice of the violation to the Administrator. Prohibits any construction of any new source or modification of any existing source of any hazardous air pollutant on the NESHAPs list if such construction or modification will increase (after the application of federally enforceable emission limitations) the emission of such hazardous air pollutant by a significant amount unless such source is required to comply with an emission standard established on a case-by-case basis by the Administrator (or a State, if delegated). Directs the Administrator to establish a standard for each source at the level which provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health from the hazardous air pollutant, unless the Administrator makes and publishes a detailed finding that such a standard is not economically or technologically practicable. Requires, where such a finding is made, that an individual new or modified source case-by-case standard: (1) be established according to the same criteria as source category standards; and (2) be no less stringent than any applicable source category standard. Provides for the delegation to States of the implementation and enforcement of emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for new or modified stationary sources. Directs the Administrator to establish a procedure, similar to that for State implementation plans (SIPs), under which each State shall submit a plan which: (1) establishes emissions standards for each hazardous air pollutant on the NESHAPs list for each existing source to which a NESHAPs emissions standard would apply if such existing source were a new source; and (2) provides for implementation and enforcement of each such standard as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than three years after establishment of such standard. Permits States to consider the remaining useful life of the existing source in applying such a standard. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe or enforce provisions of such plans where a State fails to do so. Makes it unlawful for any owner or operator of any stationary source to operate such source in violation of any applicable standard under these revised NESHAPs provisions. Eliminates that part of the definition of \"hazardous air pollutant\" which requires that no NAAQS be applicable to such pollutant (but retains consideration of increased mortality or morbidity in such definition). New Source Immunity - Sets forth \"new source immunity\" provisions establishing a ten-year \"grandfather\" period beginning with the commencement of construction of any new stationary source or modification of a major stationary source. Provides that, for such period, such sources shall not be required to comply with any emission limitation or standard under the Act which is more stringent than construction or modification permit requirements. Conditions such immunity upon: (1) issuance of a permit, on or after enactment of this Act, under a permit program of an applicable SIP approved by the Administrator; (2) compliance with permit requirements and with all applicable new source performance standards (NSPS); and (3) no subsequent physical change in the source, or change in its method of operation, which increases air pollutant emissions or results in emissions of any air pollutant not previously emitted. Excludes from such immunity any emission limitation or standard imposed on any stationary source with respect to: (1) hazardous air pollutants regulated under NESHAPs provisions; (2) pollutants with no NAAQS in effect at commencement of construction or modification, but for which a primary NAAQS is later promulgated; or (3) any other air pollutant, if the Administrator judges that the public health or welfare may be endangered. Provides that such immunity shall not prevent the imposition of any emission limitation on any individual piece of process equipment not subject to a permit emission limitation based upon the best available control technology (BACT). Acid Rain - Establishes a new program entitled \"Interstate Transport and Acid Precursor Reduction.\" Establishes an \"acid deposition region\" consisting of 31 States (east of or bordering the Mississippi River) and the District of Columbia. Directs the Administrator to: (1) study air pollution problems associated with long-range transport of pollutants in the portions of the continental United States not included in the acid deposition region; and (2) report the results to Congress within two years. Establishes an acid deposition regional target providing for a ten-year phased schedule of reductions to achieve an annual average emission level that is 10,000,000 tons of sulfur dioxide below the 1980 baseline level. Directs the Administrator, within six months, to compute and publish a target and a schedule for each affected State. Permits two or more States to agree to change their share of the sulfur dioxide emissions reduction (\"reduction\"). Requires that State reduction schedules begin within five years, be substantially complete within eight years, and reach the State target within ten years of enactment of this Act. Sets forth formulas for: (1) State reduction fractions (based on 1980 emissions from electric utility steam generating units); and (2) the 1980 baseline level for the region or any State within the region. Requires States within the region to prepare, publish, and submit to the Administrator, within two years of enactment of this Act, State programs of reduction in accordance with the State schedules. Directs the Administrator to approve State programs, within four months of submission, if such programs: (1) were adopted after public notice, opportunity for hearing, and submission to Governors of the other States in the region; and (2) contain enforceable reduction measures, including emission limitations, monitoring requirements, and compliance schedules. Requires State programs to include enforceable continuous emission reduction measures. Lists some measures that State programs may include. Permits a State or any person subject to State program requirements to substitute a reduction of twice as many units of nitrogen oxide emissions for each unit of required reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions. Provides for an EPA alternative program if a State program: (1) has not been adopted by a State within two years; or (2) has not been approved by the Administrator within two years and four months. Requires, in such cases, that any owner or operator of an electric utility steam generating unit in such State submit, within three years of enactment of this Act, a unit plan and schedule for reductions. Requires unit plans and schedules only from units which: (1) are major stationary sources; (2) are not subject to new source performance standards; and (3) actually emitted, or were permitted to emit, sulfur dioxide during 1980 in excess of a specified rate. Requires that unit plans and schedules provide for a reduction to a specified rate of emissions, according to a phased schedule (beginning within five years, substantially complete within eight years, and finally complete within ten years of the enactment of this Act). Sets forth provisions for approval of unit plans and schedules. Provides that any unit for which a plan has not been submitted and approved must comply with the specified emission limitation within five years of the enactment of this Act. Directs the Administrator to establish a program of purchase and sale of emission reduction credits among stationary sources of sulfur dioxide in five emission reduction credit regions within the acid deposition region. Provides that specified requirements under this Act shall be treated as emission limitation requirements of applicable SIPs. Sets forth procedures for petitions for determination that programs or plans will not meet deadlines and for petitions for review of such determinations or denials. Interstate Air Pollution - Requires that an SIP contain provisions for the establishment of emission limitations to prevent stationary sources within the State from interfering with the ambient air quality of other States. Requires that such SIP provisions conform to the interstate pollution abatement provisions of the Act. Revises interstate pollution abatement provisions to require prior notice to all affected nearby States from each major proposed new (or modified) source which, by itself or in combination with other sources, may interfere with the ambient air quality of another State in a specified manner. Allows any person to petition the Administrator to make a finding that emissions from stationary sources in any State are interfering with the ambient air quality of another State by contributing: (1) concentrations of a pollutant in a nonattainment area; (2) concentrations consuming any part of any maximum allowable concentration or increase over baseline concentrations of a pollutant (under prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (PSD) provisions), in any area which is not a nonattainment area for that pollutant; or (3) to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in such other State. Allows petitions relating to such interference with another State's air quality also to be submitted to the Administrator prior to approval of a SIP or of a construction or modification permit. Prohibits approval in such cases unless the Administrator determines that such interference will not result. Directs the Administrator, within 60 days of receipt of such petition, to make a finding or denial. Directs the Administrator, if such finding is made, to: (1) determine the degree to which sources in each State concerned (including the State adversely affect) contribute to the pollution concentration; and (2) require the SIPs concerned to contain emission limitations and compliance schedules for stationary sources in each State which contribute significantly to such concentrations. Requires that such limitations and schedules reduce such concentrations as promptly as practicable and, in the case of nonattainment areas, not later than the required attainment date for the adversely affected State. Requires that SIPs be revised accordingly within four months of the Administrator's order. Sets forth factors to be taken into account in setting interstate emission limitations at an equitable amount of emission reduction by each source. Allows the establishment of alternative emission limitations for existing sources in accordance with a specified policy. Requires, where appropriate, that construction or modification permits contain interstate emissions limitations established by the Administrator. Sets forth factors which may be taken into account in determining the effect of emissions from sources in any State on air pollution concentrations in any other State. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) - Directs the Administrator to promulgate (or revise) \"new source performance standards\" (NSPS) for specified categories of stationary sources. Requires that such NSPS promulgation (or revision) be completed by the end of: (1) FY 1982 for one list of source categories; (2) FY 1983 for a second list; and (3) FY 1984 for a third list. Expedited SIP Revision Process - Directs the Administrator to approve or disapprove any SIP revision within four months of receipt. Qualifies a SIP revision for a special fast-track review (approval after a 30-day public comment period during which no objections are made) if the revision relates only to one or more of specified items. Prevention of Significant Deterioration - Revises provisions (in Part C of title I of the Act) for Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (PSD). (PSD provisions currently specify allowable short-term and long-term \"increments\" of emissions of sulfur oxide and particulate matter - regulations for other pollutants are not yet final in areas with cleaner air than that required by NAAQS. Currently the smallest increments are allowed in \"class I\" areas, which include \"statutorily designated\" large national parks and wilderness areas, with larger increments in \"class II\" areas, and the largest increments in \"class III\" areas.) Repeals the \"increment\" limitations (specified \"maximum allowable increases over baseline concentrations\") for class III areas. Eliminates provisions for PSD area redesignations as class III areas. Refers, instead, to redesignation as PSD areas other than class I or II areas. Requires States to consult with local governments prior to a PSD area redesignation. Revises PSD preconstruction requirements to replace references to class III areas with references to PSD areas other than class I or II areas. Allows the permitting authority to determine in its discretion the extent to which continuous air quality monitoring data must be included in air quality analyses for preconstruction review purposes. Applies PSD preconstruction requirements only to increases of 100 tons per year of any air pollutant for which there are NAAQS regulations. Eliminates the requirement that each State provide notice to the Administrator of every action related to the consideration of PSD preconstruction permits. Requires PSD preconstruction permit applications to be made available to the public. Requires PSD preconstruction permit programs to: (1) notify applicants within two months after receipt as to whether or not the application is complete and in what respects an incomplete application should be modified; and (2) issue or deny the permit within seven months after a completed application is received. Authorizes any officer or employee of a permitting agency to communicate and meet with any applicant, prior to submission of an application, to clarify PSD preconstruction permit requirements. Directs the Administrator to establish maximum allowable increases (\"increment\" requirements) for inhalable particulates in class I and II areas whenever the Administrator promulgates a primary NAAQS for such pollutant. Authorizes the Administrator to determine whether such increment requirements shall be in addition to, or in lieu of, the increment requirements established for sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Requires that inhalable particulates increment requirements bear the same ratio to the primary NAAQS for fine particulates as the particulate matter increment requirements bear to the primary NAAQS for total suspended particulate matter in effect on December 31, 1981, using the reference method in effect on such day. Visibility - Revises provisions for visibility protection for mandatory class I Federal areas (\"statutorily designated\" large national parks and wilderness areas, which must not be designated as other than class I). Adds synthetic fuel facilities and surface mining operations to the types of \"major stationary sources\" covered by the visibility protection regulations (if such sources have the potential to emit 250 tons or more of any pollutant). Authorizes the Administrator to establish the \"best available retrofit technology\" (BART), for visibility protection program purposes, in terms of a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, where it is not feasible to enforce a numerical emission limitation representing BART. Requires that the EPA regulations for visibility protection in effect on December 31, 1981, remain in force and effect until new or amended regulations are promulgated which meet the requirements of the visibility protection program. Prohibits any stay or other modification of such regulations issued after December 31, 1981, from having any force and effect. Nonattainment Areas; Extension of Attainment Dates - Sets forth new provisions for nonattainment areas for which SIPs are not approved. Directs the Administrator to prohibit the construction or modification of any major stationary source in such area if such construction or modification would result in emissions of any air pollutant: (1) in increased amounts of 100 tons or more per year; (2) for which the primary NAAQS is not attained in such area; and (3) with respect to which SIP provisions meeting requirements for nonattainment areas are not in effect. Authorizes the Administrator to waive such prohibition where the source owner or operator demonstrates that, for such air pollutant: (1) emissions offsets will meet specified requirements; (2) the source will comply with emissions limitations representing the best available control technology (BACT); and (3) all major stationary sources owned or operated by that owner or operator in the State are in (or on a schedule of) compliance with the Act. Provides that the emissions offsets required by such waivers: (1) be contemporaneous emission reductions of that air pollutant from existing stationary sources in the area; (2) be significantly greater, in the aggregate, than the increase (or new emissions) resulting from the construction or modification; and (3) provide a positive net air quality benefit. Sets forth a required baseline for measuring such emission reductions. Sets forth provisions for transfer of alternative emission reductions in nonattainment areas. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate regulations under which such emission reductions may be: (1) sold, exchanged, or otherwise transferred; (2) registered on a public emission reduction credit register; and (3) held (\"banked\") by the owner for future use by any person for future compliance with nonattainment area provisions. Requires that any such transfer program comply with a specified policy. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Directs the Administrator, not later than March 1, 1983, to: (1) complete a review of all available data relating to the ambient air quality of the various air quality control regions; (2) determine which of such regions, or portions thereof, do not meet a primary NAAQS; and (3) revise the list of nonattainment areas accordingly. Allows six months for SIP revisions required as a result of such inclusions on the nonattainment area list. Authorizes the Administrator, where an SIP meets specified requirements, to extend the 1982 deadline for attainment of primary NAAQS for: (1) up to three years for particulate matter, hydrocarbons, and sulfur dioxide; and (2) up to five years for nitrogen oxide (retains the current five-year extension for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants, with automobile inspection and maintenance program requirements). Replaces the standard \"lowest achievable emission rate\" (LAER) with that of \"best available control technology\" for purposes of nonattainment area construction or modification permit requirements and guidance documents. Adds new definitions for purposes of nonattainment area requirements. Includes the reconstruction of a stationary source as defined by specified regulations in effect on December 31, 1980, in the definition of \"new stationary source.\" Temporary Variances - Revises provisions for temporary emergency variances of any SIP requirement applicable to a stationary source. Permits a State to apply to the Administrator for a variance of up to six months in any one set of circumstances. Directs the Administrator to approve or disapprove such application in the same manner as the special fast-track review for SIP revisions. Operations and Maintenace - Requires that SIPs include a program for periodic audits of major stationary sources to insure the proper operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment used to comply with emission limitations. Requires that the results of such audits be available to the public. Sets a deadline, six months after enactment of this Act, for submission of SIP revisions taking account of such requirements. Title II: Provisions Relating Primarily to Mobile Sources - Emissions Standards for Vehicles and Engines - Sets forth tables of emissions standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks and engines manufactured during and after model year 1983 and for heavy-duty trucks and truck engines manufactured during and after model year 1984, in terms of emissions in grams per mile (gpm) or in grams per brake horsepower-hour (gpbhh) of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate matter (TSP: total suspended particulates). Retains the current (1982 model year) standards for gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicles and engines for model year 1983 and thereafter (0.41 gpm HC; 3.4 gpm CO; and 1.0 gpm NOx). Sets model year 1983 and thereafter standards for diesel-fueled light-duty vehicles and engines (0.41 gpm HC; 3.4 gpm CO; 1.5 gpm NOx, but 1.0 gpm NOx in 1986 and thereafter; and 0.6 gpm TSP--but 0.2 gpm TSP in 1986 and thereafter). Retains the scheduled EPA standards for light-duty trucks and truck engines (HC: 1.7 gpm for 1983 and 0.8 gpm for 1984; CO: 18 gpm for 1983 and 10 gpm for 1984; and NOx: 2.3 gpm for 1983 and 1984). Sets the NOx standard for 1985 and thereafter at 2.3 gpm for 1985 and 1.2 gpm (for light-duty trucks under 6,000 pounds) or 1.7 gpm (for light-duty trucks between 6,000 and 8,500 pounds) for 1986 and thereafter. Sets a TSP standard for light-duty trucks of 0.6 for 1983 through 1985 and 2.6 for 1986 and thereafter. Retains the scheduled EPA standards for heavy-duty trucks and truck engines for model year 1984 and thereafter (1.3 gpbhh HC; 15.5 gpbhh CO; and 10.7 gpbhh NOx). Sets the heavy-duty truck NOx standard for 1986 and thereafter at 4.0 gpbhh. Sets a heavy-duty truck TSP standard of 0.25 gpbhh for 1986 and thereafter, with specified exceptions. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe different standards for emissions of reactive and nonreactive hydrocarbons from any class of vehicles and engines. Requires that any standard for reactive hydrocarbons emissions not permit a greater amount of such emissions than that which the Administrator determines would have been emitted by a light-duty vehicle conforming to model year 1981 standards. Requires that regulations for emissions of particulate matter (TSP) from heavy-duty diesel-fueled trucks and truck engines manufactured during or after model year 1986 contain emissions limits of 0.25 gpbhh unless, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, the Administrator promulgates a final rule establishing a different emissions standard. Extends, to model year 1983, the requirement that EPA regulations for CO, HC, and NOx emissions from classes or categories of heavy-duty vehicles and engines reflect the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of available technology and taking into consideration cost, noise, energy, and safety factors. Postpones, until model year 1984 (current law requires 1983), a provision that such HC and CO emissions standards require a reduction of at least 90 percent from the average of actually measured emissions from heavy-duty gasoline-fueled vehicles or engines, or any class or category thereof, manufactured during a specified baseline model year, except as otherwise provided in the emission standards tables added by this Act. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations applicable to emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and engines manufactured after model year 1983 for sale in high altitude areas. Prohibits such regulations from requiring percentage reductions or numerical standards more stringent than those applicable to vehicles or engines certified under nonhigh altitude conditions. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Warranties - Requires new motor vehicle and engine manufacturer warranties of the \"emission control device or system,\" meaning a catalytic converter, electronic control units, oxygen sensors, and exhaust recirculation valves. (Currently warranties of the vehicle or engine are required with respect to emission control performance.) Requires manufacturers to provide replacement or replacement costs of such emission control devices or systems of light-duty vehicles under certain circumstances. (Currently such replacement or costs are required with respect to parts, devices, or components designed for emission control.) Useful Life - Requires that EPA regulations provide that the useful life of: (1) light-duty trucks and truck engines be five years or 50,000 miles (the same as for light-duty vehicles and vehicle engines); and (2) heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicle engines be a period which the Administrator determines is the actual average life of the vehicle or engine. High Altitude Waiver - Authorizes the Administrator to waive a requirement that all light-duty vehicles and engines manufactured during or after model year 1984 comply with emission standards regardless of the altitude at which they are sold. Permits such waiver through model year 1985 for not more than 15 percent of the numbers of vehicles and of engines of a model year manufactured by a manufacturer for sale in high altitude areas, if the manufacturer demonstrates that such marketing would otherwise be prevented by the requirement's effect on cost, driveability, and fuel economy at high altitudes. Directs the Administrator to prescribe emissions standards for vehicles and engines granted such waiver which require a percentage of reduction in emissions at least equal to that otherwise required for the model year involved. Effective Date - Makes the amendments made by this title applicable to vehicles and engines manufactured during or after model year 1983, except as otherwise provided. Title III: Other Amendments - Administrative Procedures - Provides that no rule, regulation, guideline, policy statement, or other action of the Administrator in effect on the date of enactment of this Act may be altered in any manner except: (1) in accordance with specified administrative procedures; (2) as may be otherwise required pursuant to a court order; or (3) for those aspects of a rule or regulation which are invalidated by this Act. Visibility Study - Directs the Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior, to study means to objectively quantify visibility impairment and its causes. Specifies items to be included in such study. Directs the Administrator within two years of enactment of this Act to report study results and recommend a uniform procedure for visibility quality trend monitoring and reduction measurement. Diesel Study - Directs the Administrator, within six months of the enactment of this Act and in consultation with specified Federal agencies, to develop and implement a program to monitor and document the relationship between health effects and the introduction of diesel automobiles into the domestic fleet. Requires that the program be made in appropriate regions or areas to determine any different results. Requires that the results of such program be reported to the appropriate congressional committees as soon as practicable. Methanol Study - Directs the Administrator to: (1) accelerate ongoing studies of performance of methanol and other low-emission fueled vehicles; (2) evaluate and monitor ongoing experiments by other entities; (3) assess the cost effectiveness of such alternatives to gasoline; and (4) determine emission characteristics in methanol and other low-emission fueled engines. Directs the Administrator, if such study results are favorable, to develop a policy to encourage conversion of commercial and governmental vehicle fleets to low-emission fuels. Synfuels and Health Effects - Directs the Administrator, in consultation with specified Federal agencies, to study the adverse health effects associated with the development of a full-scale synthetic fuels industry. Indoor Air Pollution - Directs the Administrator, within one year of the enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on indoor air pollution. Requires: (1) inclusion of specified items; (2) utilization of certain findings and studies; (3) consultation with specified Federal agencies; and (4) accompaniment by recommendations for indoor air pollution control. Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for FY 1982 through FY 1986. Provides for sums necessary for: (1) the Administrator and the States to effectively carry out the Act's provisions, including training of State and local personnel, enforcement, abatement, and control, consideration of SIPs and revisions, and audits; and (2) sufficient funding for personnel for the Administrator to carry out the Act, particularly its regulatory functions, without undue reliance on contractors. Requires that such authorization not be less than the appropriations authorized in fiscal year 1981 to carry out the Act, plus percentage increases for each fiscal year equal to Consumer Price Index percentage increases during the preceding calendar year. Prohibits the Administrator from using any funds appropriated under the Act for any payment for a reduction-in-force in any fiscal year. Directs the Administrator to inform the appropriate committees of the Congress of the reasons for such reduction, its impact on carrying out the Act, and other detailed or pertinent information, at least 30 days prior to issuing any general notice of such reduction. Declares that nothing in this title shall authorize appropriations for any research and development activities under the Act."
