Exempts other manufacturers from any provision in the passive restraint standard which requires installation of a passive restraint system in a passenger car having a wheelbase from 100 to 114 inches, if the Secretary is satisfied that such car will not be produced after December 31, 1982. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress by July 1, 1985, on the effectiveness of such requirements."
