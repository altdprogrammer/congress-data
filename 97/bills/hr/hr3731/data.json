Directs the Secretary to submit, within the one-year period, proposed legislation to the Congress to authorize use or distribution of judgment funds whenever circumstances do not permit submission of a use and distribution plan. Requires the Secretary to obtain the consent of the involved tribal governments when use and distribution plans divide judgment funds between two or more beneficiaries. Directs the Secretary to submit proposed legislation to the Congress, if consent cannot be obtained within 180 days. Permits the Secretary to request 180-day extensions of the one-year period for submission of use and distribution plans. Subjects such requests to the approval of specified Senate and House committees. Allows judgment funds to be disbursed, under plans approved by the Secretary and the tribal governing body, to the parents or legal guardians of minors or legal incompetents for specified purposes. Limits such plans to urgent needs arising from extenuating circumstances and requires strict accounting for expenditures. Directs the Secretary, in the development of use and distribution plans, to: (1) survey past and present tribal economic development plans; (2) consider long range benefits to the tribe from such economic development plans; and (3) encourage appropriate programming of funds for economic development purposes. Eliminates provisions permitting either House of the Congress to disapprove use and distribution plans, submitted by the Department of the Interior, by adopting a simple resolution. Provides, instead, that such plans may be disapproved by enactment of a joint resolution. Permits the Secretary to withdraw or amend use and distribution plans submitted to Congress, within a 60-day period and before adoption of any resolution of disapproval. Requires that amendments affecting an award division be consented to by the beneficiaries involved. Makes any such amended plan valid 60 days after submission to the Congress, unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted within that 60-day period . Permits an amended plan to be submitted at any time within the original one-year submission period, if the Secretary withdraws the original use and distribution plan. Requires that the 60-day period be recomputed from the date of introduction of such joint resolution of disapproval in either House and them not be extended again. Exempts the first $2,000 of any per capita share of judgment funds from consideration as income or resources for purposes of eligibility or benefits under any Federal or federally-assisted program. Makes such exemption retroactive to shares distributed pursuant to plans approved by Congress after December 31, 1981. Exempts the interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands from consideration as a resource in determining eligibility for assistance under any Federal or federally-assisted program."
