Prohibits judicial or administrative review of the second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II) final environmental statement dated January 1979. Requires that the following lands be managed for multiple uses other than wilderness: (1) national forest system lands not identified under this Act as land recommended for wilderness, requiring further planning, or previously designated as wilderness; (2) lands recommended for wilderness pursuant to this Act and not designated as wilderness before January 1, 1985; and (3) lands identified by this Act as requiring further planning but (a) not recommended for wilderness by the Secretary before September 30, 1985, or (b) recommended for wilderness before such date but not designated as wilderness before January 1, 1988. Prohibits the Secretary from conducting any further statewide, regional, or national roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands for purposes of determining their suitability as wilderness without express congressional authorization, except for lands identified pursuant to this Act as requiring further planning. Prohibits the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around areas designated as wilderness. Requires the Secretary to manage lands recommended for wilderness and lands requiring further planning to preserve their wilderness character. Permits the authorization of nonwilderness uses which are in the public interest for lands recommended for wilderness and the modification of wilderness recommendations by the Secretary."
