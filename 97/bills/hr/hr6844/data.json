    "text": "Food Stamp Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to require the rounding down of dollar amounts for the thrifty food plan in computing deductions of household income and in calculating the value of allotments. Includes disabled veterans and their survivors as eligible for benefits under the food stamp program. Excludes from household income cost-of-living increases attributable to specified provisions of the Social Security Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, and pensions for veterans of a period of war. Changes the date for adjusting deductions in computing household income from July 1, 1983, to October 1, 1983. Establishes categorical eligibility for recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children under the Social Security program. Authorizes State agencies to select certain categories of households which may file periodic reports of household circumstances at less frequent intervals than other types of households. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to require job search information at the time of an individual's application for food stamps. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to use an alternative coupon issuance system if such system improves the integrity of the food stamp program. Prohibits the issuance of an initial month allotment under $10. Authorizes a State agency to promptly reduce or terminate benefits for any household which provides written information that clearly requires a reduction or termination. Requires State agencies to determine, not less frequently than annually, whether food stamp recipients are in receipt of duplicative benefits. Requires State agencies to reimburse the Secretary for the value of excess allotments issued to households. Sets forth a formula for reducing an agency's federally funded share of administrative costs based upon the State's payment error rate. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985. Allows the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to provide food assistance in the form of cash for FY 1982 and 1983. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study of the impact of such assistance and submit a report of the findings to the appropriate congressional committees not later than six months after enactment of this Act. Makes certain provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 effective on the date of enactment of this Act."
