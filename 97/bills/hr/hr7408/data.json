Defines \"abuse\" and \"imprudence\" for the purpose of determining whether or not cost passthroughs should be denied. Defines \"abuse\" to include: (1) take-or-pay clauses; and (2) indefinite price escalator clauses which meet specified criteria. Defines \"imprudence\" as any action which: (1) is not in the public interest; or (2) materially prevents a pipeline from responding to changes in customer demands or other relevant market factors."
