Directs the Secretary to reduce reporting requirements imposed on air carriers under such Act to the minimum necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1981.

Terminates the authority of the Secretary in regard to pooling and cooperative working agreements, to the extent such authority relates to interstate and overseas air transportation, at the close of September 30, 1983. Exempts specified types of air transportation of persons or property within the State of Alaska from preemption by Federal laws or rules concerning rates, routes, or services of an air carrier having authority under such Act to provide interstate air transportation. Terminates the authority of the Secretary, as of September 30, 1982, to issue special operating authorization to a supplemental air carrier. Accelerates, to specified dates, the termination of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Revises guidelines by which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may issue airport operating certificates. Title II: Amendments to Other Laws - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Clayton Act, and the Consumer Credit Protection Act to reflect the termination of the Board. Revises provisions concerning the air transportation of mail, including mail to foreign countries. Removes certain contract restrictions on such transportation of mail. Amends the International Aviation Facilities Act, the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 to reflect the termination of the Board. Repeals specified provisions of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 concerning employee protection programs.
