    "date": "1982-07-20", 
    "text": "Atmospheric, Climatic, and Ocean Pollution Act of 1982 - Title I: Declaration of Findings and Purposes - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes. Title II: General Program Authorizations and Reporting Requirements - Authorizes appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce for atmospheric, climatic, and ocean pollution programs for FY 1983 and 1984. Permits the transfer of funds between categories. Requires the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to notify Congress of the nature of, and reasons for, any transfers in excess of ten percent, or the appropriate committees of Congress must notify the Administrator that they have no objection to such transfer. Requires the Administrator to report to the appropriate committees of Congress on all aspects of the atmospheric, climatic, and ocean pollution activities of such Administration. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress and the President on the same date as the FY 1984 budget request a report on the importance of meteorological satellites to weather forecasting, including analyses of the impact of such satellites on forecasting, their expected lifetimes and replacement times, and the appropriateness of transferring civilian meteorological satellites to the private sector. Prohibits the use of funds to effectuate such transfer unless the appropriate committees of Congress give the Secretary of Commerce written notice of no objection within 30 days after receipt of a comprehensive plan for such transfer. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress and the President on the future organization and technological capabilities of the National Weather Service, including cost estimates and a ten year reorganization plan. Title III: National Climate Program - National Climate Program Amendments of 1982 - Amends the National Climate Program Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish and maintain an interagency Climate Program Policy Board (Board) to coordinate planning, review all executive branch budget requests relating to climate, establish other groups as necessary and establish and maintain a committee of users and producers of climate data and services to provide advice on the conduct of the program. Establishes the position of Director to head the National Climate Program Office, represent the Board, and be the spokesperson for the program. Requires the Office to analyze agency budget requests, coordinate interagency participation in international climate-related activities, and work with the National Academy of Sciences and other groups in preparing and implementing the five-year climate plan. Permits the Office to provide financial assistance for activities needed to meet the goals of the program set forth in such plan. Expands the mechanisms for intergovernmental climate-related studies and services under the program. Requires that the plan be revised and extended not more than biennially but not less than quadrennially. Title IV: Great Lakes Protection - Great Lakes Protection Act of 1982 - Amends the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978 to redesignate specified provisions and to revise definitions under such Act. Establishes a Great Lakes protection policy under such Act. Establishes within NOAA a Great Lakes Research Office to be directed by an Executive Director appointed by the Administrator after consultation with the Governors of specified affected States. Requires the Executive Director to compile, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, an inventory of all major actions of the Federal, State, and local governments since 1977 which have significantly affected (or may so affect) the environmental quality of the Great Lakes. Requires that such inventory be submitted to the Congress and the President and be updated at least once every three months. Sets forth responsibilities of the Executive Director. Requires that, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, the Executive Director report to the President and the Congress on: (1) the current state of Federal research efforts to improve the Great Lakes' environmental quality; (2) recommendations for the improvement, increased coordination and use of such research efforts; and (3) the degree of coordination among the States to preserve and protect such quality. Requires that responsible Federal officials include Great Lakes environmental impact analyses in their recommendations or reports for major Federal actions significantly affecting the Great Lakes. Sets forth provisions relating to such analyses, including a requirement that copies be available to the President and to the public. Revises provisions relating to interagency cooperation, dissemination of information, and effect on other laws. Extends through FY 1984 the authorization of appropriations to carry out the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978. Reserves a specified amount of such appropriations to be obligated and expended on the Great Lakes Research Office in each fiscal year ending after September 30, 1982. Title V: Ocean Pollution Research - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to combine ocean dumping and monitoring reporting requirements into a single annual congressional report due in March of each year. Specifies that the following are to be included in the NOAA research program: (1) development of techniques for quantifying and defining marine environment degradation; (2) assessment of the ocean waters' ability to assimilate waste materials; and (3) monitoring programs to assess the health of coastal ecosystems. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess the feasibility of regional management plans for waste disposal which integrate social and economic factors into Federal decisions regarding ocean dumping. Requires such guidelines to be reported to Congress by October 1, 1984. Directs the Administrator of EPA, in cooperation with the Administrator of NOAA, to report to the President and Congress by the end of 1983 on sewage sludge disposal in the New York City region. Authorizes appropriations for each of FY 1983 and 1984 for such report. Title VI: Other Programs - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 and 1984 for reporting of weather modification activities."
