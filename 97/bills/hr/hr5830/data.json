    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to repeal the requirement that new fossil fuel fired stationary sources of air pollution comply with a standard of performance which requires a percentage reduction in air pollutant emissions. Revises provisions for standards of performance for new stationary sources (NSPS) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to take into consideration the cost of achieving the degree of emission limitation required by the NSPS, energy impact, and any environmental effects unrelated to air quality. Removes the requirement that the system of continuous emission reduction under NSPS be a \"technological\" system or process. Includes in the definition of such system or process the use of inherently low-polluting fuels or raw materials. Permits application of such amended requirements to fossil fuel fired electric utility steam generating units which were constructed or modified after September 18, 1978, and before the publication of regulations reflecting the amendments made by this Act."
