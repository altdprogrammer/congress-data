    "text": "Amends the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act of 1980 to declare a congressional finding that continually escalating interest rates and credit costs have had a negative effect on the housing, consumer credit, and agricultural sectors of the economy, increased the insurance risk of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and threatened the safety and soundness of depository institutions by eroding their net worth and earnings. Requires any action taken by the Deregulation Committee to be approved by a unanimous vote of the voting members of such Committee. Requires the Committee, before approving any action with respect to the phase-out and elimination of limitations on the maximum rates of interest and dividends paid on deposits and accounts, to make specified findings that such action will not: (1) increase the insurance risk of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (2) reduce the availability of, or materially increase the cost of, consumer, home mortgage, or agricultural credit; or (3) significantly reduce the net worth or earnings of such institutions or affect the safety and soundness of such institutions."
