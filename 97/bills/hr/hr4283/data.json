Makes the bonds negotiable instruments payable solely from funds earmarked by the act authorizing the bond issuance. Authorizes as additional security for the bonds: (1) the facilities financed by the bonds; (2) other funds or property owned by the entity which benefits from the bonds; or (3) any other assets approved by the Council. Retains the prohibition against mortgaging or pledging property owned by the District of Columbia or the United States. Grants the District the power to enter into and amend agreements concerning the acquisition, use or disposition of money or property relating to projects financed by the bonds. Allows acts authorizing bond issuance to contain remedies for bond holders upon default. Exempts from congressional approval: (1) transfers of funds derived from sales of bonds; (2) bond payments; and (3) transfers or grants of security interests in funds or property to secure bond payments. Authorizes the Mayor to pledge, assign, or deposit District funds in any account or trust to secure bond payments."
