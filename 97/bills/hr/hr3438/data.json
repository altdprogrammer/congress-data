    "text": "Establishes a Pilotage Regulatory Advisory Committee to: (1) review existing and proposed rules concerning the qualification standards or licensing requirements for pilots navigating vessels in United States waters; (2) consult with, advise, and make recommendations to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating with respect to such standards or requirements; and (3) submit to the Secretary any proposed amendments to, or any recommendations for the repeal of, such rules which the committee determines are necessary. Directs the Secretary not to take any significant action with regard to the rules or administrative policy governing the licensing of such pilots without first consulting the Committee. Sets forth provisions concerning Committee membership and administrative support services. Exempts the Committee from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Terminates the Committee on the date: (1) the Secretary receives notice that the Committee has determined it is unnecessary to amend or repeal any rules or proposed rules; or (2) a final rule, or an amendment to a rule, incorporating any proposed amendment or recommendation of the Committee takes effect, whichever occurs first."
