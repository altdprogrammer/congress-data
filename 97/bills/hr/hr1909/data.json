Directs the Secretary to identify at least two geographically distributed demonstration facility sites, located in different geologic media, in the continental United States. Requires the Secretary to establish at each site a technology demonstration facility for research and development. Sets forth design requirements and construction dates for such facilities. Prohibits the conversion of such facilities into permanent disposal facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish waste solidification facilities designed to provide a waste form resistant to the release of radionuclides and to reduce the health hazard of such wastes. Requires that such wastes and facilities be ready for placement in completed demonstration facilities. Requires consultation and coordination with States in which demonstration facility sites are located on the Department's plans for such facilities. Directs the Secretary to transmit a comprehensive management plan to specified Congressional committees. Requires submission of a description of such plan as in effect each year to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to provide funds by contract to initiate and maintain the activities under this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
