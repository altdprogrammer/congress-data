Amends the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 to require the Secretary of the Interior to use funds appropriated under such Act to provide financial assistance to plan and develop the WEB rural water development project under the terms and conditions of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Department of Agriculture, except to the extent such Act, rules, or regulations are inconsistent with the provisions of the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct feasibility investigations of the following Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin programs in South Dakota: (1) the Oahe unit, James Division; (2) the Garrison unit; and (3) the Pollock-Herreid unit. Sets forth criteria to be considered by the Secretary in reporting such studies to Congress. Permits the Secretary to contract with the State to carry out such studies. Authorizes the Secretary to cancel the master contract and participating and security contracts for the Oahe unit, initial stage. Requires that such actions be taken with the agreement of the Oahe Conservancy Subdistrict and the Spink and West Brown Irrigation Districts. Authorizes the Secretary, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, to make available the Missouri River basin program pumping power to specified irrigation projects constructed in South Dakota by Indian tribes or by public entities.
