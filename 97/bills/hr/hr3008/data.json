Directs the Secretary of State to establish an Advisory Council in South Africa to advise the Secretary with respect to the implementation of such employment principles and to review the annual reports which each U.S. person covered by this Act must submit to the Secretary on the progress made in implementing such principles. Directs the Secretary to establish in the United States an American Advisory Council to make policy recommendations regarding labor practices of U.S. persons in South Africa and to review such persons' progress in implementing such employment practices. Directs the Secretary: (1) to take specified actions to insure compliance with the implementation of such employment principles; and (2) to review the compliance of such persons at least biennially. Sets forth penalties for noncompliance. Authorizes the President to waive compliance with the implementation of such principles if such compliance would harm U.S. national security. Prohibits any U.S. financial or lending institution from making any loan directly or through a foreign subsidiary to South Africa unless such loan is for educational, housing or health facilities available to all persons on a nondiscriminatory basis. Prohibits the importation of any gold coin minted in South Africa or sold by South Africa. Requires any financial or lending institution which makes a loan directly or through a foreign subsidiary to any entity in South Africa other than the Government or a Government controlled organization to report annually to the Secretary on such loan. Makes such report available to the public. Directs the Secretary to take specified actions to enforce the prohibitions on loans and the importation of gold coins. Sets forth penalties for violations of such prohibitions. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibitions for one year if South Africa meets specified conditions."
