    "text": "Food Stamp Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to change the dates for adjustments in the thrifty food plan and deductions in computing household income. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to require job search information at the time of an individual's application for food stamps. Extends the period of ineligibility for heads of households who voluntarily quit a job without good cause from 60 days to 120 days. Removes the exemption which allows a parent in a household not to register for work when there is another parent in such household exempted from work registration because of caring for a dependent under age six. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to use an alternative coupon issuance system if such system improves the integrity of the food stamp program. Prohibits the issuance of an initial month allotment under $10. Requires the rounding down of dollar amounts provided under the food stamp program. Sets forth eligibility criteria for allotments to households in immediate need of expedited service. Requires State agencies to determine, not less frequently than quarterly, whether food stamp recipients are in receipt of duplicative benefits. Requires State agencies to reimburse the Secretary for the value of excessive allotments issued to households. Sets forth a formula for increasing an agency's federally funded share of administrative costs based upon the State's low payment error rate. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985. Makes certain provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 effective on the date of enactment of this Act."
