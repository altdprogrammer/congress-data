    "text": "El Salvador Assistance Act of 1981 - Authorizes the obligation of funds for military and economic assistance under specified Federal laws for El Salvador only if prior to each such grant of assistance the President certifies to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that El Salvador's Government: (1) is not engaged in consistently violating internationally recognized human rights; (2) has achieved substantial control over its armed forces; (3) is making progress in implementing essential economic and political reforms; (4) is committed to holding free elections; and (5) has demonstrated its willingness to negotiate a political resolution of the conflict. Directs the President, if such certification is not made or if such certification is made but does not take effect, to: (1) suspend specified military assistance and military education and training for El Salvador; (2) withhold approvals for use of certain credits and guarantees for El Salvador; (3) suspend deliveries of certain defense articles, defense services, and design and construction services; and (4) withdraw from El Salvador all U.S. armed forces performing specified functions. Prohibits such certification from taking effect until 30 days after Congress receives the certification. Requires it to take effect only if Congress does not adopt a concurrent resolution objecting to the provision of military assistance to El Salvador. Prohibits the President from making such certification until the President certifies that El Salvador's Government has made good faith efforts to investigate the murders of six U.S. citizens in El Salvador and to bring those responsible for the murders to justice. Includes the drawdown of defense articles or services in an unforeseen military emergency within the obligation of funds for military assistance which can be made only after such certification. Prohibits the waiver of such certification requirement."
