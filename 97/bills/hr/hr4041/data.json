    "text": "American Shrimp Industry Development Act - Title I: Shrimp Harvesters Cooperative Associations - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make loans to assist: (1) certain shrimp cooperatives in carrying out marketing activities and in constructing or acquiring physical facilities necessary for their operations; and (2) certain shrimp harvesters who are members of a shrimp cooperative in consolidating debts incurred by purchasing or refitting fishing vessels. Establishes in the Treasury a revolving fund to be available for making such loans. Directs the Secretary to deposit in the fund payments of interest and principal received from such loans. Authorizes appropriations to the fund for each fiscal year after fiscal year 1981. Makes the Act authorizing associations of producers of aquatic products applicable to shrimp cooperatives if shrimp harvesters control a specified percent of the business of the association. Title II: Tariff and Quota Provisions Affecting Shrimp - Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to impose a tariff on imported shrimp. Imposes a quota on imported shrimp for calendar years 1982-1986. Sets forth a procedure by which the Secretary may increase the quota of imported shrimp during any such year. Title III: Establishment of Regional Boards for Research on, and Promotion of, the Shrimp Fisheries - Directs the Secretary to identify the resident shrimp harvesters of each shrimp producing region and to conduct a referendum among the harvesters regarding the establishment of a Regional Shrimp Board for their shrimp producing region. Provides for the establishment and consolidation of Regional Shrimp Boards. Sets forth the functions and powers of Regional Shrimp Boards including the duty to implement plans for the promotion, marketing and research of shrimp. Title IV: Reporting and Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary to require shrimp harvesters, shrimp cooperatives, and other persons involved in the shrimp industry in the United States to report certain statistics. Provides for: (1) prescribing regulations necessary for collecting statistics; (2) maintaining the confidentiality of statistics submitted to the Secretary; and (3) imposing civil penalties for violation of statistics regulations. Directs the Secretary to establish a system for reporting shrimp import statistics. Directs the Secretary to award a fisheries research and development project grant for establishing and operating a project which utilizes an associated fishery or for carrying out a project to improve fuel efficiency in shrimp fishery harvesting if the application is made during fiscal year 1982, 1983, or 1984, and if the applicant and the proposed project meet certain requirements.
