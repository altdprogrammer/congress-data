Sets the amount of such credit at $1,000 for each such elderly person living in the household. Limits the aggregate amount creditable to $2,000 on any return for the taxable year. Defines \"qualified elderly person\" as any individual who: (1) has attained age 65; (2) has an impairment which, as determined by a physician, renders such individual physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself and has lasted or is expected to last six months or longer; and (3) has as a principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year the home of the taxpayer."
