Eliminates the duty and function of the Administration to serve as such an advocate. Directs the Commissioner to review and comment on Federal regulations and policies regarding community health and social service development for the elderly only upon request by the head of any Federal agency or department. Removes the duty of the Commissioner to advise, consult, and cooperate with such heads and the duty of such heads to consult with the Commissioner. Directs the Commissioner to consult with such heads only upon their request. Eliminates the National Information and Resource Clearing House for the Aging. Repeals specified requirements for completed studies and reports. Repeals a provision that a Congressional declaration of policy respecting Insular Areas not apply to the administration of programs for older Americans. Eliminates conditions that: (1) assistance for program planning, development, establishment, and operation be given to private organizations only if they are nonprofit; and (2) grant or contract recipients enter into agreements with a profitmaking organization only where such organization demonstrates clear superiority with respect to the quality of services covered. Repeals separate authorizations of appropriations for the Federal Council on the Aging and for the Commissioner to carry out specified duties. Title II: Amendments to Title III - Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 for grants for State and community programs on aging (without separate earmarks for particular programs). Revises formulas for grant allotments to States for such programs. Sets forth formulas for the percentages of such allotments which may be used for administrative costs of State and area plans and for costs of social services and nutrition services. Sets forth provisions relating to the non-Federal share of program funding. Requires that States use for such nutrition services, from their fiscal year 1982 allotment, a specified minimum amount proportionate to that used in fiscal year 1981. Sets forth provisions relating to additional amounts for administration of State plans. Adds definitions of State plan administration and area plan administration. Specifies that a State agency on aging is only responsible to the extent feasible to review and comment on State plans, budgets, and policies affecting the elderly. Permits a State which had previously functioned as a single planning and service area to designate additional planning and service areas within the State to be administered by area agencies on aging. Revises requirements for area plans to: (1) permit such plans to cover periods of two, three, or four years; and (2) modify review and comment responsibilities of area agencies on aging. Eliminates requirements that area agencies: (1) expend a portion of allotted funds for access, in-home, and legal services; and (2) develop and publish methods to determine priority of service. Revises requirements for State plans to: (1) permit such plans to cover two, three, or four year periods; and (2) eliminate a minimum spending requirement for rural area programs. Requires that nutrition service projects be available to \"older persons\" (currently, to \"individuals aged 60 and older\"). Revises provisions for a State long-term care ombudsman program to no longer require that such program carry out specified functions but only that it have authority to do so. Repeals a limitation on the use of nutrition services funds for social services. Eliminates requirements that a State plan: (1) provide for the delivery and coordination of legal services to the elderly; and (2) expend a specified amount to establish and operate a nursing home ombudsman program. Repeals provisions relating to specified waivers of requirements for State plans. Lowers the percentage of specified appropriated funds which must be set aside for disaster relief reimbursement (from an amount equal to five percent) to not less than three percent. Eliminates requirements that surplus agricultural commodities be purchased for and donated to nutrition services for the elderly at annually programmed levels of assistance. Continues the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture and of the Commodity Credit Corporation to make such purchases and donations. Eliminates annual assistance level requirements for such donations. Permits a State to receive commodities in lieu of cash for part of the Federal share of the cost of nutrition services. Authorizes the Commissioner and the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into an agreement under which the Secretary shall provide such commodities to the States on a reimbursable basis. Eliminates provisions for cash payments to States in lieu of donated food commodities. Eliminates requirements that the Commissioner carry out grant programs for State social services and congregate and home-delivered nutrition services. Permits State plans for such services to include any of specified projects or services.

Eliminates requirements that the Secretary of Health and Human Services: (1) involve appropriate Federal department and agencies in carrying out such programs to insure coordination and avoid duplication of efforts; and (2) report to the Congress annually on the impact of grants made, the experience of grantees, and the comparative benefits and costs of projects assisted. Eliminates specified authority relating to certain grants programs, including: (1) training and demonstration projects for legal assistance to the elderly; (2) utility and home heating cost demonstration projects; and (3) mortgage insurance and interest grants for multipurpose senior centers. Continues the authority of the Commissioner to make grants and contracts for: (1) recruitment and training; (2) gerontology centers; (3) research, development, and demonstration projects; and (4) national impact activities.

Eliminates a requirement that a nonprofit private organization selected by the tribal organization conduct (still required) period evaluations of such grants projects. Authorizes appropriations for such grants to Indians program for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 (excluding the multipurpose senior centers for Indians program). Title VI: Other Provisions - Amends the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978 to repeal provisions relating to the administrative powers of the National Council on the Handicapped.
