    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-04-28", 
    "text": "Food Stamp and Commodity Distribution Amendments of 1981 - Title I: Major Food Stamp Revisions - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to provide for a reduction in the value of food stamp allotments to households in which school age children (up to a maximum of four children) are eligible for meals under the national school lunch program. Defines \"school age child\" to mean a household member of at least six years of age but less than 18 years of age and any other household member attending elementary or secondary school. Provides for an annual adjustment of the thrifty food plan in lieu of a semi-annual adjustment. Makes the household income eligibility standard 130 percent of the nonfarm income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget. Eliminates the requirement for reports by: (1) the Secretary of Agriculture on the feasibility of recovering excessive food stamp benefits through Federal income tax data; and (2) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office on the review of the various consumer price indices. Increases the standard deduction in computing income for eligible households and the excess shelter expense deduction for such households. Eliminates the semi-annual adjustment of such deductions. Repeals increases in the dependent care deductions for working adults and medical deductions for the elderly and disabled. Revises retrospective accounting procedures to calculate income for households that derive their income in a period shorter than a year. Provides that certain household income, as of October 1, 1983, be calculated on a basis of anticipated income. Exempts migrant farmworker households from periodic income reporting requirements. Provides that all other households which fail to submit such report shall not receive an allotment for the period covered by such report. Title II: Other Food Stamp Cost Reductions - Excludes from certain food stamp eligibility: (1) boarders (persons who live with others or pay compensation to others for meals); (2) participants in drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs; (3) disabled or blind recipients of Social Security benefits; and (4) battered women and children temporarily residing in public or private nonprofit shelters. Declares that sources of income that are excluded from household income for purposes of the food stamp program are those sources determined by Federal law. Limits outreach services of State agencies to informing applicants and participants of their rights and responsibilities and regulations under the food stamp program. Sets forth the determining factors for households to be considered in immediate need of expedited service under such program. Title III: Improving Administrative Procedures for the Food Stamp Program - Revises the definition of retail food stores and the qualifications for such stores to accept and redeem food stamp coupons. Disallows expense deductions for expenses paid by a third party on behalf of a household. Sets forth eligibility criteria for sponsored aliens under the food stamp program. Eliminates provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 requiring the Secretary to follow regulations in force as of June 1, 1977, to prescribe the types and allowable amounts of financial resources an eligible household may own. Provides a procedure for the collection of overissuance of coupons by the reduction of monthly allotments. Makes households ineligible for food stamp assistance where the heads of such households voluntarily quit work, whether or not such household was eligible for assistance immediately prior to such unemployment. Provides that any person exempted from work requirements under the food stamp program because of compliance with work requirements under the Social Security Act, shall be held non-exempt under such program for noncompliance under such Act. Allows persons required to register for work under such program to be referred to State-operated community work experience programs. Requires certain unemployed persons in eligible households to register for employment once every twelve months (formerly once every six months). Restricts cash for change when using food stamp coupons to the lowest coupon denomination issued. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations to prescribe the liability of States for coupons issued through the mail. Directs State agencies to promptly restore food stamp benefits upon the request of households where such benefits were wrongfully denied or terminated, except in cases where such denials occurred during a period of time more than a year earlier than such request. Eliminates the requirement of the Secretary to supplement the nutrition education program with printed materials designed for persons with low reading and comprehension levels. Repeals the 60-day transfer of certification for eligible households which move from one political subdivision to another. Authorizes the Secretary to waive claims arising under provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and to reduce amounts due any State agency to collect unpaid claims assessed against such agency which has exhausted its appeal rights under such Act. Provides for an increase in the federally funded share of administrative costs to State agencies whose quality control programs result in less than the nationwide percentage of errors. Eliminates the requirement for the Secretary to establish staffing standards for State agencies. Directs that funds collected from claims arising under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 be credited to the food stamp appropriation account for the fiscal year in which the collection occurs. Directs that funds provided to State agencies for administrative cost-sharing be paid from such account. Title IV: Food Stamp Funding - Increases the amount of appropriations for fiscal year 1981, and sets forth amounts for fiscal year 1982 through 1985. Title V: Commodity Distribution Program - Amends the Agricultural Consumer Protection Act of 1973 to extend the authority of the Secretary to purchase and distribute agricultural commodities for food assistance programs for fiscal years 1982 through 1985. Sets forth penalties for fraud under such Act. Title VI: Food Stamp Cash-Out of SSI Recipients - Directs the Secretary, upon the request of a State, to find that such State's cash payments under the Social Security Act have been specifically increased to include the bonus value of food stamps, for purposes of determining food stamp eligibility for supplemental security income recipients."
