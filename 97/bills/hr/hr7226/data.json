Excludes from gross income up to $125,000 of gain from the sale of farmland development rights by an individual aged 55 or older. Allows a charitable contribution deduction for gain from the sale of farmland development rights to such eligible recipients to the extent that the fair market value of such rights exceeds the amount actually received by the taxpayer. Provides rules for the allocation of basis on the sale of such rights. Prescribes criteria for determining whether there is a significant public benefit from such charitable contributions."
