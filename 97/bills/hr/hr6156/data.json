Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to regulate the trading of such securities, but not an option on a contract for future delivery. Prohibits any State law prohibiting or regulating wagering or gaming contracts or the operation of \"bucket shops\" or similar activities from invalidating any put, call, straddle, option or privilege or other security or other activity related to the offer, purchase, sale, exercise, settlement or closeout of any such instrument if the instrument is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission for trading under the rules of a securities self-regulatory organization."
