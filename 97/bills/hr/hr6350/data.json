Requires the Administrator to publish regulations as specified. Permits the participation of VA employees as part-time students in the Veterans Administration Health Professional Scholarship Program. Reduces the obligation and stipend payable to such a student. Denies a stipend to full-time VA employees. Increases the time for which such a scholarship may be awarded. Extends from September 30, 1982, to September 30, 1983, the authority of the Administrator to contract for hospital care or medical services in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands without reference to patient loads or incidence of provision of medical services for veterans treated by the VA in the contiguous 48 States. Entitles to reinstatement in the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) any spouse, surviving spouse, or child who loses CHAMPUS eligibility by becoming entitled to hospital insurance benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, but then exhausts some or all of such medicare benefits. Extends the pilot program for the treatment and rehabilitation for alcohol or drug dependency or abuse disabilities through FY 1983. Includes all veterans cared for in State homes in the payment procedures formulated for the care of war veterans. Extends through FY 1986 the program of matching grants for construction or alteration of State veterans' homes. Authorizes the Administrator to exchange medical information and techniques with State home facilities furnishing care to veterans. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress on the use of flexible and compressed work schedules."
