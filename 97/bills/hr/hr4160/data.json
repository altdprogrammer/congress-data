Requires accompaniment of such motion by an affidavit stating the reasons that the records sought are not relevant to a legitimate tax inquiry or any other legal basis for quashing the summons. Requires any third party upon receipt of a summons to proceed to assemble the records requested and to be prepared to deliver them at the required time."
