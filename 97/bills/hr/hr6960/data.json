States that no financial condition may be imposed to assure the safety of any person or the community. Prohibits release of the defendant when his appearance cannot be assured. Allows as a condition of release that the defendant not commit a Federal, State, or local crime, intimidate a witness or victim, or destroy evidence. Provides a procedure for revocation of release if the defendant violates any condition of release."
