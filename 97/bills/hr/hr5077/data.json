    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Defines such offense as using a firearm to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction or carrying a firearm during such a felony involving violence. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried illegally. Increases the additional penalty for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to ten years to life for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Makes an offender ineligible for parole during the first one-half of the term of imprisonment imposed."
