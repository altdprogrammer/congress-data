    "text": "Repeals specified provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 which amended the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to: (1) eliminate a national trigger; (2) exclude extended or additional compensation claims in the determination of the insured unemployment rate; and (3) change the State trigger. Provides that the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 shall apply as if such amendments had not been enacted (thus restoring the national trigger, again counting extended or additional compensation in determining the insured unemployment rate, and restoring the State trigger to its previous level). Reaffirms the support of the Congress for the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 and for its goals of full employment, increased real income, and balanced growth."
