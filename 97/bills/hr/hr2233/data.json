Directs the Secretary to ascertain that Government purchases of such commodities include acquisition of quantities of like classes of the particular commodities proportionate to the quantities of those classes for which sales were suspended. States that if an export suspension occurs after January 1, 1980, and remains in effect on October 1, 1981, the applicable loan level shall be adjusted as provided in this Act."
