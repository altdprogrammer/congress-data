    "text": "Weather Modification Research, Development, and Policy Act of 1982 - Establishes a national weather modification management program, including: (1) a subprogram for basic atmospheric research, utilizing relevant elements of the national climate program; (2) a subprogram for applied research and demonstration experiments, focussing on unresolved questions concerning techniques of precipitation augmentation or reduction, safety and efficacy, and techniques of measuring cloud and storm parameters; (3) cooperative efforts between the Federal Government, the private sector, State and foreign governments, and international organizations; (4) a subprogram for weather modification regulation and international protocol; (5) a subprogram for developing and utilizing sound management practices for conducting weather modification activities; (6) studies on unintentional weather modification caused by society's use of land, water, and energy; (7) studies on the economic, environmental, legal, and societal effects from weather modification; (8) a procedure for reporting weather modification activities in the United States; (9) a periodic assessment of the need for Federal regulation of weather modification; and (10) a five-year plan for the management of Federal research and development efforts in weather modification. Requires the President to appoint a Director to be the principal Federal officer responsible for planning and administering the Program, work with the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Weather Modification, seek independent advice, consult and cooperate with the States and encourage cooperation with other nations in the exchange of information and participate in international activities. Directs the President to establish and maintain a Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee on Weather Modification to consist of representatives from the Federal departments and agencies involved in the program. Requires each such department or agency with program duties and responsibilities to utilize the expertise and resources of universities, private interests, and State and local governments, ensure that each Federal weather modification project includes an environmental impact statement, and assist in the preparation of the annual report. Requires persons with primary supervisory responsibility for conducting any weather modification activity in the United States to prepare and maintain daily records for submission to the Director in a prescribed format. Directs the Director to maintain and make available to the public a record of all reported weather modification activities in the United States. Establishes civil penalties for violations of the recordkeeping requirements. Directs the Committee to prepare and submit annually to the President and the authorizing committees of Congress a report on the activities conducted pursuant to this Act. Permits any Federal department or agency to enter into contracts or make grants to carry out the purpose of this Act. States that such contracts and grants may be: (1) up to 50 percent of the total annual cost of the project or activity to a State or local government; and (2) up to 100 percent of the total annual cost to any other entity. Sets forth the terms and conditions for such contracts or grants, including the recordkeeping requirements. Repeals a previous Act which required the reporting of weather modification activities to the Federal Government. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983 through 1985."
