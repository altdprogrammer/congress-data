    "text": "Federal Supplemental Unemployment Compensation Act of 1982 - Permits States to enter into and participate in agreements with the Secretary of Labor under this Act and to terminate such agreements upon providing 30 days' written notice to the Secretary. Requires that such agreements provide that the State agency will make Federal supplemental compensation payments: (1) to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular and extended compensation under State law, have no rights to unemployment compensation with respect to a week under State or Federal law, and are not receiving Canadian unemployment compensation with respect to such week; and (2) for any week of unemployment which begins in an extended benefit period and the individual's period of eligibility. Prohibits any Federal supplemental compensation payment to any individual for any week of unemployment which begins more than two years after the end of the benefit year for which rights to regular compensation were exhausted. Makes the amount of Federal supplemental compensation payable to any individual for any week of total unemployment equal to the amount of the regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable during the benefit year under the State law. Requires that the amount established in an individual's Federal supplemental compensation account equal the lesser of: (1) 50 percent of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable with respect to the benefit year on the basis of which regular compensation was most recently received; or (2) 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. Prohibits payment of Federal supplemental compensation to any individual under an agreement entered into under this Act for any week beginning: (1) before the first week beginning after enactment of this Act or the week following the week in which such agreement is entered into, whichever is later; or (2) after September 30, 1983. Provides for Federal payments to States having agreements for the payment of Federal supplemental compensation. Directs the Secretary to certify from time to time to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable under this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make such payments by transfers from funds appropriated pursuant to this Act to the account of the State in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Authorizes appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury, without fiscal year limitation, as necessary to carry out this Act. Sets forth provisions relating to fraud and overpayments."
