    "text": "Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate: (1) minimum standards for the accreditation of educational programs to train individuals to perform radiologic procedures; (2) minimum standards for the certification of persons who administer radiologic procedures; and (3) Federal radiation guidelines with respect to radiologic procedures. Directs the Secretary to provide a model law for radiologic procedure safety to the States which makes it unlawful for non-certified individuals to perform radiologic procedures and limits educational requirements for certification to accredited programs. Requires the Secretary to reduce financial assistance under the Public Health Service Act to States which fail to meet the minimum Federal standards within three years of the effective date of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt specific assistance in the public interest. Applies standards promulgated under this Act to all Federal agencies but directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to prescribe regulations making the standards applicable to veterans' facilities. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress on the regulations promulgated under this Act."
