Requires, before an election, that: (1) the Administrator make available to the public in the region a cost-effectiveness study with respect to the project involved and receive public comments on such study; and (2) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council provide an opportunity for supporters and opponents of the proposed financing to present their views in a voter's pamphlet which shall be distributed throughout the region. Sets forth procedural requirements with respect to such elections. Prohibits the Administrator from making payments to, or on behalf of, the Washington Public Power Supply System to finance construction activity at Washington nuclear project numbered 1, 2, or 3, unless the payment has been approved by a majority of the voters in an election. Makes this Act subject to judicial review for only 60 days after its enactment."
