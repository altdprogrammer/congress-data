    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide that for purposes of applying criminal penalties and knowing endangerment provisions, \"hazardous waste\" means any substance so defined by hazardous waste management regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Bars judicial review of such regulations in any criminal action under specified Federal enforcement provisions. Applies criminal penalties to any person who knowingly violates such regulations. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations prohibiting the delivery of hazardous waste to any transporter not having a hazardous waste transportation identification number on file with the Administrator (or with a State, where there is an authorized State hazardous waste program). Applies criminal penalties to any persons who knowingly transport, treat, store, or dispose of any hazardous waste in violation of any State or local law or ordinance. Provides that any act indictable under specified criminal penalties and knowing endangerment provisions shall be treated as racketeering activity under Federal criminal law."
