Reduces the time period during which the Secretary of Commerce may terminate a designation of area eligibility. Repeals provisions concerning: (1) Indian economic development; (2) economic recovery assistance for disaster areas; and (3) the job opportunities program. Redefines \"eligible recipient\" to exclude Indian tribes.
