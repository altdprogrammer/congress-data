    "text": "Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1982 - Extends copyright protection to mask works. Defines a mask work as a series of related images: (1) having the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product; and (2) in which the relation of the images to one another is that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the chip product. Excludes masks and mask works from the pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works categories. Sets forth the exclusive rights the owner of copyright holds, including the right to: (1) embody the mask work in a mask, a two-dimensional partially transparent and opaque sheet; (2) distribute a mask embodying the mask work; (3) reproduce such work on material intended to be part of the semiconductor chip product; and (4) manufacture and distribute semiconductor chip products incorporating such masks. Sets forth limitations on such exclusive rights, including compulsory licensing, as specified. Sets the copyright term for masks at ten years from first authorized distribution, use, or manufacture. Excludes an innocent purchaser in good faith of a semiconductor chip product from infringement liability. Permits the impoundment and seizure of masks made or used in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights."
