    "text": "Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to provide a seven-day period of Congressional review for all Acts passed by the Council which do not involve a Federal interest. Requires the Committee on the District of Columbia of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate to promptly hold hearings to determine such involvement for any such Act at the request of any Member of Congress. Provides a 30-day period of Congressional review for any Acts passed by the Council which are determined to involve a Federal interest. Declares that any temporary emergency legislation passed by the Council shall take effect immediately upon a determination by either Congressional committee that such Act does not involve a Federal interest. Provides that when neither House of Congress is in session because of an adjournment or recess of more than three days, such Acts shall become effective subject to either review procedure when Congress reconvenes. Makes the Congressional review periods applicable to all Acts transmitted to Congress on or after the date of enactment of this Act."
