Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to furnish medical services on an outpatient or ambulatory basis to such veterans. Amends the Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 to expand the scope of the epidemiological study of the health effects of Agent Orange to include an evaluation of the long term adverse health effects on humans serving in the armed forces of the United States in Vietnam during the Vietnamese conflict or other factors involved in such service, including exposure to other herbicides, chemicals, medications, or environmental hazards or conditions. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to expand the scope of the literature analysis and review to include an analysis and review of the literature covering other studies relating to the effects of such factors. Extends through September 30, 1983 (two additional years) the period during which Vietnam-era veterans may initially request psychological readjustment counseling. Extends educational assistance without a delimiting period for vocational training for veterans of the Vietnam era determined to be in need of such assistance."
