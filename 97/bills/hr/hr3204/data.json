Defines \"district heating or cooling system\" as a system comprised of a thermal or cooling source connected to a piping network which provides hot or cold water or steam to at least two buildings for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes. Qualifies for the investment tax credit: (1) property which enables the taxpayer to use in his trade or business hot or cold water or steam from a district heating or cooling system or to sell energy to such a system on a proportionate basis; and (2) any amount paid or incurred for connection to a district heating or cooling system. Excludes from treatment as energy property any district heating or cooling property used as public utility property."
