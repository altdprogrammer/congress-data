    "text": "National Social Security Lottery Act - Title I: The National Lottery - Establishes the National Lottery Commission to establish and operate a national lottery on an annual basis. Requires that lottery tickets be sold at U.S. post offices and any other places specified by the Commission. Prohibits the sale of any tickets and the awarding of any prize to any person under the age of 21. Sets the minimum amount of lottery prizes to be awarded in any fiscal year at 40 percent of the lottery revenues in such fiscal year. Exempts lottery prize money from Federal, State, and local taxation. Sets forth criminal penalties for: (1) the sale of forged or stolen national lottery tickets; (2) fraud with respect to the national lottery; (3) unauthorized sales of national lottery tickets; (4) sales of such tickets at unauthorized prices; and (5) sales of such tickets to persons under the age of 21. Declares the sale of lottery tickets under this Act to be a Federal function for the purpose of raising revenue. Permits the sale of national lottery tickets anywhere under U.S. jurisdiction. Requires the Commission to consult and cooperate with appropriate State and local authorities in order to facilitate the operation of the national lottery and to minimize its impact in any area where it is permitted. Title II: Use of Lottery Revenues in Financing of Social Security Program - Requires that the lottery revenues not used for the operation of the national lottery or for lottery prizes be deposited periodically in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Sets the minimum amount to be deposited in any fiscal year in such funds at 40 percent of the total lottery revenues for such fiscal year."
