Requires a depository institution which uses information in denying credit or increasing credit charges to inform the consumer in clear language of: (1) the specific reason for the adverse decision; (2) the specific information relied upon; (3) the consumer's right to inspect and copy such information; and (4) consumer rights provided under such Act. Provides for enforcement of this Act by the appropriate Federal agencies. Title II: Electronic Funds Transfer Services - Requires an electronic funds transfer service to destroy individually identifiable account information 45 days after the date of each transaction.
