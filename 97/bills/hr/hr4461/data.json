    "text": "Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to expand the applicability of the provisions of such Act relating to incentives for the development of underground coal mines so that such provisions shall apply to all coal mines. Revises provisions relating to the guarantee of loans for the development of such mines to provide that an individual may receive a loan guarantee only if the individual has obtained a contract for the sale or resale of coal from the mine, the duration of which meets requirements that the Secretary of Energy shall prescribe. Deletes the requirement that the sale or resale must be to an individual in compliance with the Clean Air Act. Redefines the term \"low sulfur coal\" to mean coal with sulfur content that does not exceed the maximum sulfur content permitted under the Clean Air Act and any applicable implementation plan."
