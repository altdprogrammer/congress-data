    "text": "Dairy Product Stabilization Act of 1982 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to remove the upper limit (90 percent of parity) on the price support for milk. (Retains the current lower limit of not less than 75 percent). Provides for individual producer marketing bases based on the previous years' production. Authorizes county committees established under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act to adjust the size of such bases under certain circumstances. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the percentage reduction of milk production in any marketing year for which the quantity to be produced exceeds necessary requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to impose assessments for excess marketing. Sets forth penalties for nonpayment of such assessments (with judicial review in U.S. district courts). Establishes in the Treasury a Dairy Product Stabilization Fund for the deposit of assessment receipts and for the purchase of milk and milk products. Directs the Secretary to conduct a referendum among producers to determine if they disapprove of this Act. Provides for the repeal of this Act upon a majority vote of disapproval."
