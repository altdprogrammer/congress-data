Sets forth application requirements for such program for qualified hospitals designed to protect against the diversion of distributed heroin into illicit channels. Authorizes the Secretary to import opium to manufacture heroin, if amounts confiscated are insufficient to meet the needs of qualified hospitals. Amends specified provisions of law to conform to provisions of this Act. Requires the Secretary to report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources within specified time periods on the activities under the temporary heroin program."
