    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes the Architect of the Capitol to provide training, according to specified provisions of Federal law, for employees of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol and the Botanic Garden and other employees under the Architect's supervision. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 to make certain technical amendments concerning: (1) civil service retirement credit for military service; (2) interest on civil service retirement deposits or contributions; (3) entitlement to a lump-sum credit for or a refund of retirement funds; (4) use of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to pay the administrative expenses of withholding taxes from civil service annuities; (5) the offsetting of civilian pay by the amount of cost of living increases in military retired or retainer pay; (6) disability retirement eligibility, especially for National Guard technicians; (7) retirement contributions by employed annuitants; (8) the reduction of annuities based in part on military service by a portion of the amount of Social Security survivor benefits; (9) computation of the hourly pay rate of Federal employees; and (10) travel expenses for employees stationed in Alaska or Hawaii. Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine the difference between the amount of the Government contribution to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program for 1983 and the amount such contribution would have been if the two employee organizations included in the 1981 calculations were included in the 1983 calculations. Requires the Government to pay the difference into the contingency reserves of all health benefits plans for 1983 in proportion to the number of enrollees in each plan. Entitles any career appointee of the Senior Executive Service (SES) who is scheduled to be removed due to a reduction in force to: (1) be detailed for 60 days by the OPM to a vacant SES position in any agency for which the OPM deems the individual to be qualified; (2) be placed in such position after such 60 days unless the agency determines that the individual is not qualified; and (3) appeal such a determination to the Merit Systems Position Board."
