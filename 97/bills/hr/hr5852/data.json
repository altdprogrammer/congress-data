    "text": "Private/Public Partnership for Jobs Act of 1982 - Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) to require that annual plans for FY 1983 and thereafter include adequate assurances that, in the aggregate, the training programs to which prime sponsors provide CETA funds will provide \"partnership training\" to at least 50 percent of the individuals enrolled. Defines partnership training as training in skills specifically requested by employers in the area served who enter into a commitment with the area prime sponsor to employ such individuals upon successful completion of the skills instruction program. Permits the payment of an employment bonus to such employers equal to one-half of the wages and benefits paid to such individuals during the first six months of employment (but only if they are retained for at least that long a period). Provides, in the case of on-the-job partnership training, that such employers shall be eligible to receive that same 50 percent portion of the wages and benefits paid plus an employment bonus equal to 20 percent of such wages and benefits at the end of the first six months of employment. Requires that annual plans provide for utilization of Federal, State, and local agency services and facilities in order to avoid duplication of such existing services and facilities (currently requires provision for such utilization to the extent deemed appropriate by the prime sponsor after giving due consideration to the effectiveness of such existing services and facilities)."
