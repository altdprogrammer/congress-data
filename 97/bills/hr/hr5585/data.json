Repeals the FCC's authority to revoke a license or permit because of conditions coming to the attention of the FCC that would warrant refusing to grant the original application. Repeals the FCC's authority to suspend a license for broadcasting obscene language. Repeals the FCC's authority to revoke a license, issue a cease and desist order, or order forfeiture penalties against broadcast stations that have: (1) broadcast lottery information; (2) committed fraud; or (3) broadcast obscene language. Repeals the equal time provisions of the Communications Act. Denies the FCC any power of censorship over the content of communications. Denies the FCC the authority to require an opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on any issue (repeals the fairness doctrine)."
