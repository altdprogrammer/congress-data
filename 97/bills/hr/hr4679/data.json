    "text": "Antifencing Act of 1981 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for illegal transactions in precious items, including jewelry and gems. Applies this crime to dealers whose business affects commerce, who purchase precious items from the public, but excludes purchase from wholesalers. Includes as prohibited transactions: (1) purchasing a precious item from a person under the age of 18 or from a person who fails to present identification; (2) failing to keep records or refusing access to records to law enforcement officers; (3) making payment other than by check or other draft; (4) failing to retain the item for seven days; or (5) purchasing an item from a person who is intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance. Makes a dealer who commits a violation of this Act, knowing that the item was stolen, embezzled, or converted, civilly liable to the victim of such crime."
