    "text": "Great Plains States Groundwater Demonstration Program Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau), to conduct, in two phases, an investigation of and establish demonstration projects for groundwater recharge of aquifers in the following Great Plains States: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. Directs the Bureau to consult with the United States Geological Survey, other appropriate Federal agencies and departments, and the Great Plains States to carry out this Act. Directs the Bureau, during phase I, to develop a detailed plan for not less than 12 demonstration projects to determine whether various recharge technologies may be applied to diverse geologic and hydrologic conditions represented in the Great Plains States. Directs the Bureau to recommend demonstration projects to be designed, constructed, and operated during phase II. Requires the Secretary, within 18 months of enactment of an appropriation Act to carry out phase I, to transmit a report to Congress containing recommendations for phase II and a detailed statement of findings and conclusions. Directs the Bureau during phase II to carry out the recommendations made in the Secretary's report to Congress. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Bureau, to contract with the Great Plains States to conduct a study to: (1) identify and evaluate alternative means by which the costs of groundwater recharge projects could be allocated among the project beneficiaries; and (2) identify and evaluate the economic feasibility of and the legal authority for utilizing groundwater recharge in water resource development projects. Requires the Secretary to submit interim reports to Congress on the progress of provisions of this Act within 12 months after the initiation of phase II and a final report within five years. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1982, for phase I and such sums as may be necessary to carry out phase II. Authorizes the matching of Federal funds to meet the costs of phase II and authorizes the Secretary to enter into memoranda of agreement with the Great Plains States to meet the costs of phase II."
