Enumerates factors to be considered by the court in determining the validity of claims. States that the amount of losses shall not include lost profits, distress sale proceeds, attorney fees, or interest on losses. Sets forth the measure of losses for the types of claimants. Prescribes the respective measures of losses for producers, converters, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of Tris-treated sleepwear or the fabric, yarn, or fiber. Prohibits class action claims. Directs the subrogation of the United States to successful claimants' rights to recover losses. Bars claims under this Act unless begun within two years of enactment.
