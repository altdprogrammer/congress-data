    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-04-07", 
    "text": "Economic Equity Act - Title I: Tax and Retirement Matters - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that the maximum deduction for contributions to an individual retirement plan: (1) shall be computed separately for each individual who is married; and (2) in the case of a married individual who has no compensation or less compensation than that of the spouse, shall be determined as if such compensation were the same as that of the individual's spouse. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to require that a retirement plan which provides an annuity to a participant with at least ten years of creditable service shall provide a survivor's annuity for the spouse of a participant who dies before the annuity starting date in an amount not less than the amount which would have been made under the survivor's annuity if the participant had survived and retired on such annuity date. Provides that a participant's election not to take a joint and survivor's annuity shall not be effective unless the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such an election. Allows the assignment of the benefits of a qualified retirement plan in the case of a judgment, decree or order relating to child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights pursuant to a State domestic relations law. Amends ERISA to lower the age limitation for participation in a qualified retirement plan from age 25 to age 21. Amends ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code to provide for accruals of creditable service to continue while an individual is on approved maternity or paternity leave at the rate of 20 hours service for each week of approved leave. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase the zero bracket amount; (2) lower the tax rate; (3) decrease withholding requirements; and (4) increase minimum filing requirements for heads of households. Entitles former spouses of members of the uniformed services, civil service employees and members of Congress who were married to such a member or employee for at least ten years during creditable service to an annuity based upon a portion of such member's or employee's retired or retainer pay period. Amends the Survivor Benefit Plan of the uniformed services to make former spouses eligible for annuities under such plan. Provides for survivor's annuities for surviving former spouses of civil service spouses or members of Congress. Provides that the election of a member of the uniformed services, civil service employee or member of Congress not to take a joint and survivor's annuity shall not be effective unless the spouse and any former spouse of such member or employee consents in writing to such an election. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit to employers of displaced homemakers. Title II: Day Care Program - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the tax credit for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment from 20 percent of the cost of such services to 50 percent of the cost reduced by one percent for each $1,000 amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $10,000. Makes such credit refundable. Increases the dollar limit for such credit from $2,000 to $2,400 (from $4,000 to $4,800 for two or more dependents). Allows such credit for certain services performed outside the taxpayer's household. Establishes a minimum income for individuals engaged in business on a substantially full time basis to be used in the computation of the earned income limitation on the amount of such credit. Includes as a tax-exempt organization any organization which provides non-residential dependent care services to the general public for purposes of enabling individuals to be gainfully employed. Title III: Armed Forces - Revises the rules for the distribution of the property of deceased members of the Air Force and Army by removing any gender distinctions from such rules. Establishes a distribution formula based on six classes: (1) beneficiary named in a will; (2) surviving spouse; (3) children; (4) parents; (5) siblings; and (6) next of kin. Eliminates sexual distinctions with regard to promotion procedures and procedures to remove reserve officers from active duty status in the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve. Requires the Secretary of Defense to make an annual report to the Congress concerning the status of women in the armed forces. Title IV: Estate Tax on Agricultural Property and Farm Loans - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the unified credit against the estate and gift tax from $47,000 to $192,800 by specified annual increments through 1985. Increases the minimum gross estate requirement for filing a return from $175,000 to $600,000. Qualifies estates of decedents who were disabled or retired for the special valuation of certain farms based on use if they materially participated in the operation of such farm for five out of eight years preceding the year in which they became disabled or eligible for disability benefits. Permits the spouse of a decedent to use such valuation if the spouse has managed the farm or business for ten years preceding the decedent's death. Permits active management rather than material participation as a test for qualification of the estate for spouses, children under 21, students, and disabled individuals who receive property from a decedent who qualified for special use valuation. Repeals the $500,000 limitation on the reduction of the value of qualified real property permitted by the special use valuation. Provides that the interest rate on extended payments of estate taxes shall be the lower of 6 percent or 75 percent of the prime rate. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to remove the preference to married persons in receiving farm improvement loans. Title V: NonDiscrimination in Insurance Act - Prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the consideration of applications for, or the granting of, insurance policies and the terms of such policies. Permits insurers who regularly provide insurance solely to persons of a single religious affiliation to continue to do so. Grants to State or local governments having insurance discrimination laws the primary opportunity to enforce this Act. Permits an aggrieved person to file a civil action in State or Federal court against an insurer, if a State or local authority which has received notice of a complaint fails to act within 60 days or with respect to those authorities not having insurance discrimination laws. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in district court when there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or group is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the rights granted by this Act and that such denial raises an issue of general public importance. Title VI: Regulatory Reform and Sex Neutrality - Requires the head of each executive agency to conduct a review of all rules, regulations and policies of the agency which result in different treatment based on gender. Directs each agency to report annually to the Congress on such review. Provides that such report shall include proposals to eliminate any resultant sex-based discrimination. Requires that all rules, regulations, documents and other writings of executive agencies shall use words that are neutral as to gender unless it is impracticable to do so or the subject matter specifically applies only to one sex. Title VII: Study of Enforcement of Alimony and Child Support Payments - Directs the Attorney General to undertake a study of the appropriate role of the Federal Government in the enforcement of delinquent payments of alimony, child support, and property settlement orders against an absent spouse or parent. Requires the Attorney General to submit to the President and the Congress not later than one year after enactment of this Act a report of such study together with recommendations for appropriate legislation. Authorizes appropriations."
