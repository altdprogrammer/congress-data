Permits the President to restrict exports of such a commodity during a declared war or national emergency. Declares that any strike or lockout which interferes with the execution of such an export sales contract shall be considered to affect an entire industry and imperil the national health and safety for purposes of specified sections of the Labor Management Relations Act."
