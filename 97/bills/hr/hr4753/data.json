Entitles a non-U.S. citizen or national to a single lump-sum benefit on the basis of such individual's wages and self-employment income if such individual is lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or employment purposes or such individual's status is changed to permit such individual to work in the United States. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of a non-U.S. citizen or national whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a non-U.S. citizen or national who is not a permanent resident of the United States or who has not been admitted to the United States for employment purposes. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of a U.S. citizen or national whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a non-U.S. citizen or national."
