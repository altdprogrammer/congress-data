Prohibits the Secretary from deleting lands at Black Bay and conveying them to Minnesota unless Minnesota transfers to the Secretary all right, title, and interest in certain State-owned lands and agrees to: (1) establish a wildlife management area in the area at Black Bay to be conveyed; (2) manage the waters of, and State lands ripiarian to, Black Bay to preserve the natural character of the area; (3) prohibit the transfer of any right, title, or interest in such Black Bay area to any person other than the Secretary; and (4) permit the Secretary access to such Black Bay area. Provides for reversion of Minnesota's interests in such Black Bay area to the United States if Minnesota fails to comply with such agreement. Requires the President to make recommendations to Congress by June 1, 1983, with respect to the suitability of any area in the park as wilderness. Increases the authorization of appropriations for land acquisition for the park. Directs the Secretary to establish a plan for visitor use and overnight visitor facilities for the park. Authorizes appropriations for the development of the plan. Requires the Secretary to study, and make recommendations to specified congressional committees concerning, existing road access to the park. Authorizes appropriations for such study."
