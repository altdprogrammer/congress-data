Revises evaluation system provisions to permit the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make allotments to the States for management information and evaluation systems regarding such programs. Requires a State to include in its overall plan a plan for such management and evaluation system. Provides that allotments for such purposes shall be proportional to the overall State allotment. Revises special grant provisions to permit the Secretary to make grants for: (1) demonstration projects that are of national significance or are conducted in more than one State or involve two or more Federal agencies; (2) demonstration projects to improve protection and advocacy services; and (3) certain evaluation projects. Requires a State to have an approved plan before an application may be approved. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1984. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts (under the same conditions as grants) under such Act."
