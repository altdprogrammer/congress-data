Provides that such land be held in trust by the United States for the Tribe and that specified rights of third parties be preserved. Subjects the lands transferred to the Tribe pursuant to this Act to such rights-of-way as the Secretary considers necessary to provide access to adjoining or nearby Federal lands. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Tribe as to the location and scope of any such right-of-way. Prohibits any such land exchange if, at the time such exchange is proposed, the value of the Tribe's interests in those lands exceeds by more than 125 percent the value of the interests in lands which the Tribe would receive. Provides for excess value payments by the Secretary to the Tribe, or by the Tribe to the United States, where appropriate. Authorizes appropriations for such payments by the Secretary."
