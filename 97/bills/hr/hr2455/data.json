    "text": "National Endowment for Soil and Water Conservation Act of 1981 - Establishes a National Endowment for Soil and Water Conservation, managed by a Board of Governors including the Secretary of Agriculture and six Presidential appointees, which shall: (1) encourage, through financial assistance and other means, the adoption and maintenance of soil and water conservation practices and systems on non-public lands; and (2) direct studies and forums aimed at demonstrating the benefits of using newly approved conservation techniques. Directs the Board to make available cost-sharing or loan funds from the Endowment to landowners for up to 90 percent of the cost of adopting or maintaining conservation practices or systems. Authorizes the Board to coordinate Endowment programs with existing Federal programs, other public agency programs, or private groups, using facilities and personnel of the Department of Agriculture. Exempts the Endowment and any contributions to it from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. Prohibits the use of contributions for general administrative costs. Limits obligations and expenditures. Limits eligibility for financial assistance to natural resource conservation measures recommended by a county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee or by a soil conservation district board. Requires such measures to meet Federal, State or local government technical standards. Requires the Board to submit biennial reports to Congress. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983 through 1992."
