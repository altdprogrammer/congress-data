Establishes in the Department of Commerce the Handicapped Employment and Business Opportunities Administration. Directs the Secretary to delegate his or her functions under this Act to the head of such Administration. Directs the Secretary to establish and publish a list of the commodities produced and services provided by any qualified industry employing the blind or other severely handicapped (currently restricted to qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind or severely handicapped). Permits any qualified industry determined by the Secretary to be eligible to receive Government contracts to apply to have a commodity or service placed on such list. Directs the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the capacity of such applicant to produce the commodity or service in accordance with Government specifications and time requirements; and (2) publish his or her determination concerning the application. Authorizes the Secretary to reject the placement of any item on the list and to limit the quantity of any item approved for the list. Directs the Secretary to determine and revise as appropriate the fair market price of items which are on the list and which are offered for sale to the Government. Specifies procedures for determining an item's fair market price. Directs the Secretary to establish and administer criteria for determining the eligibility of qualified industries that apply to receive Government contracts for items on the list. Authorizes any qualified industry which meets such criteria to receive Government contracts if it is determined before the contract is awarded that the qualified industry is not in violation of any: (1) applicable standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Act; (2) order of the National Labor Relations Board; or (3) applicable provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Directs the Secretary to reevaluate each qualified industry periodically. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for allocating Government contracts among qualified industries. Authorizes the Secretary to regulate: (1) specifications for commodities and services on the procurement list; (2) time of their delivery; and (3) such other matters necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act, including standards designed to promote upward mobility and to expand opportunities for blind and other severely handicapped persons. Directs the Secretary to insure that priority be given to purchasing items from qualified industries employing the blind. Authorizes the Secretary to hire either a nonprofit or a for profit organization for the purpose of: (1) furnishing technical assistance for qualified industries providing commodities or services to the Government; and (2) projects designed to help blind or other severely handicapped persons to achieve upward mobility within qualified industries or to move from employment in qualified industries to the private sector. Limits the amount of money the Secretary may spend for such purposes. Directs the Secretary to make a continuing study and evaluation of the Secretary's activities under this Act. Establishes a Coordination and Advisory Council to: (1) advise the Secretary on all functions and activities of the Handicapped Employment and Business Opportunities Administration; (2) monitor the implementation of this Act and recommend methods of expanding opportunities for the blind and other severely handicapped; and (3) help the Secretary coordinate the contracting activities of the Federal Government under this Act. Requires Federal agencies to procure any commodity or service on the procurement list from a qualified industry at the price established by the Secretary. Exempts from such requirement certain products made by prison inmates. Grants the Comptroller General of the United States access, for auditing purposes, to any records of the Administration and to certain records of Federal agencies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1982 through 1985. Abolishes the Committee for the Purchase of Products and Services of the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped."
