    "text": "Prohibits Federal involvement in the performance of abortions, except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the child were carried to term. Includes the following activities within the scope of this prohibition: (1) performance of an abortion by a Federal agency; (2) use of appropriated funds to perform or reimburse or refer for abortions; (3) use of funds for research or training with respect to abortion; or (4) contracting for insurance which pays or reimburses for abortions. Prohibits any institution receiving Federal funding from discriminating against any employee or student because of such person's opposition to abortion. Declares that for the purposes of the due process clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution, human life exists from conception without regard to race, sex, age, health, defect, or condition of dependency, and that \"person\" includes all human beings. Recognizes the compelling interest of each State to protect the lives of those whom the State regards as human beings, independent of the status of unborn children under the 14th amendment. Provides for expedited Supreme Court review with regard to this Act."
