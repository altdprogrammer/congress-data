    "text": "Health Planning Amendments of 1982 - Amends title XV (National Health Planning and Development) of the Public Health Service Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for State health planning through FY 1985. Permits the Governor of any State to request the Secretary of Health and Human Serivces to exclude portions of the State from the health service areas. Eliminates the requirement that health service areas be established throughout the United States. Eliminates the requirement that a public health systems agency (HSA) which is a public regional planning body or a unit of local government have a separate governing body for health planning. Reduces the functions of the HSAs. Permits the Governor of any State to terminate existing HSAs. Requires the approval of the Governor for the designation of any new HSAs. Requires, for an HSA to be eligible for Federal funds in FY 1983, that the Governor submit a plan for the collection by the HSA in FY 1984 and 1985 of non-Federal funds to meet matching requirements. Requires that the State planning agency and the HSAs comply with the new requirements of this Act by September 30, 1983, to remain eligible for Federal funding. Reduces from five to three the number of authorized Centers for Health Planning."
