Eliminates the requirement that the youth-participant be a member of an economically disadvantaged family. Revises the definition of \"qualified cooperative education program\" to encompass all types of education (presently, limited to vocational education). Revises the definition of \"qualified school\" to mean a tax-exempt public school."
