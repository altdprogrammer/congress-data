Rept. 97-863) Prohibits recovery of damages for the injury or death of a foreign seaman if the incident occurred: (1) while such seaman was engaged in the exploration, development, or production of offshore mineral or energy resources; and (2) in the territorial waters or waters overlying the continental shelf of a nation other than the United States, its territories, or possessions. Allows such seaman to bring an action for recovery of damages after a showing that no remedy was available in the nation asserting jurisdiction where the incident occurred or in the nation of the seaman's residency or citizenship. Requires that all of the crew of an offshore supply vessel be U.S. citizens. Declares that if a vacancy occurs within 30 days of the date of the last departure from a U.S. port, that vacancy shall be filled by a U.S. citizen. Allows the filling of such a vacancy by a non-citizen after such time, but only until the vessel's first call at a U.S. port."
