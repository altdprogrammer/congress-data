    "text": "Food Stamp Act Reform Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to provide that an authorization card held by an eligible household show any amount to be paid by such household for an allotment of food stamp coupons. Excludes the use of food stamps by persons 60 years of age or older or those receiving supplemental security income benefits at private establishments that contract with State agencies to sell food at concessional prices. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make adjustments to uniform allotments for households with respect to the age and sex of its members. Includes energy assistance payments as household income for purposes of the food stamp program. Excludes households from food stamp assistance if any member who is physically and mentally fit refuses to accept employment under a State workfare program established by this Act. Exempts any household member responsible for the care of a dependent child under the age of six (currently the age of 12) from such workfare program requirement. Prohibits households eligible for food stamp benefits prior to a member going on strike from receiving increased benefits as a result of such strike. Prohibits any household from participating in the food stamp program for any month such household exceeds specified earned income and certain nonfarm income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget. Exempts households containing a member 60 years of age or over or a member who receives certain payments under the Social Security Act from such prohibition. Eliminates provisions which reduce the value of allotments to eligible households by a specified percentage of such household's income. Sets forth a formula for reducing the value of allotments to households containing members who participate in the national school lunch program under the National School Lunch Act. Provides that the value of an allotment in excess of the amount charged for such allotment shall not be considered income for purposes of Federal, State, or local laws. Sets forth standards and procedures for determining which households, and the amount such households, shall be charged for allotments. Requires that funds received by coupon issuers from such charges shall be deposited into the Treasury and that State agencies be notified of such deposits in a manner prescribed by regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture. Sets forth penalties for violations of such regulations. Revises requirements of the monthly operations report to be submitted by coupon issuers to the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to provide periodic reports on the receipt of coupon issuer notifications of deposits. Directs the Secretary and the U.S. Postal Service to jointly arrange for the prompt deposit of such funds collected by the Service on behalf of a State. Prohibits State agencies from conducting food stamp outreach activities with funds provided by this Act. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations for State agencies to establish and operate workfare programs which make available public employment for certain food stamp recipients. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement evaluation measures to determine the effectiveness of workfare programs established by this Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Food Stamp Act of 1977 consistent with the provisions of this Act."
