Amends the Clayton Act to exempt joint ventures limited to commerce with foreign nations, other than import commerce, from provisions prohibiting a corporation from acquiring the stock or assets of another corporation to lessen competition or create a monopoly. Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide that such Act shall not prohibit unfair methods of competition involving commerce with foreign nations other than import commerce, unless such methods have a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic or import commerce or on the export commerce of a domestic person."
