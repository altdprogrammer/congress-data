    "text": "Cogeneration and Small Power Production Program Clarification Act of 1982 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require that the rates for electric energy purchased by an electric utility from a qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power production facility be established at the incremental cost to the utility of alternative electric energy, unless the State regulatory authority or a nonregulated electric utility determines that another rate: (1) would encourage cogeneration and small power production; (2) would not discriminate against qualifying cogenerators and small power producers; and (3) would be consistent with the interests of consumers and with the public interest. Provides that rules prescribed by the Federal Power Commission must require electric utilities to offer to interconnect with qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities in addition to requiring that electric utilities offer to sell electric energy to, and buy electric energy from, such facilities. Requires that such facilities pay any reasonable interconnection costs incurred by the utilities making such an offer. Authorizes the State regulatory authority to prescribe the terms for an interconnection if the electric utility and the qualifying cogeneration or small power production facility involved cannot resolve disputes concerning their interconnection."
