Makes inapplicable to this Act the provision of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act which prohibits the Secretary from selling, exchanging, leasing, or otherwise disposing of property to other than public authorities. Conditions such release upon the State's agreement not to sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of such land: (1) except to a certain cemetery, exclusively for its expansion; and (2) unless the proceeds from such disposal are held in an account open to inspection by the Secretary and used for public purposes. Reserves the mineral interests in such lands to the United States. Makes the release granted under this Act applicable so long as the land is used for cemetery purposes."
