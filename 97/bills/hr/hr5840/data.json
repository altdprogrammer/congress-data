Requires the States or other non-Federal bodies to agree to pay specified percentages of the costs of construction and operation of such projects. Requires any revenues from such projects to be shared between the non-Federal interests and the participating Federal agencies based on their percentage contribution to the project. Terminates projects authorized prior to this Act if: (1) construction has not begun within five years of enactment of this Act; and (2) the project is not on a State's priority list. Authorizes the Council to study regional water resources projects that have national significance and priority. Directs the Council to select up to ten of such projects from among projects authorized prior to enactment of this Act which shall be eligible for direct funding by Congress without regard to specific limitations in this Act. Directs that such projects, if authorized specifically by Congress, shall be constructed at Federal cost. Permits the use of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, and any replacement trust funds, to pay the non-Federal contribution for commercial inland navigation projects. Requires the Council to report to Congress concerning: (1) national priorities for water resources management through the year 2000; (2) State needs for water resources projects; (3) the best ways to maximize the efficient use of water supplies from existing Federal projects; and (4) cost-sharing mechanisms for water resources projects. Title II: Water Supply Rehabilitation and Conservation Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, to plan and carry out rehabilitation of existing urban water supply and distribution systems. Directs the Secretary, after public hearings and consultation with affected States and municipalities, to: (1) review methods of rehabilitating and upgrading means of urban water supply; (2) study methods of maintaining and preserving adequate urban water supply systems; and (3) transmit such studies to Congress by January 1, 1984.
