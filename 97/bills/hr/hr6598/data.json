Rept. 97-785 (Part I)) Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 - Provides that this Act shall not apply to atomic energy defense activities or to facilities connected with such activities. Provides that this Act shall not require the release of classified national security information. Requires the Secretary of Energy to notify the State in which, or the Indian tribe on whose reservation, a repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel from atomic energy defense activities is proposed to be located. Entitles the State or Indian tribe involved to rights of participation and consultation with respect to the development of such a repository. Sets forth procedural requirements for public hearings held by the Secretary pursuant to this Act. Title I: High-Level Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel - Subtitle A: Repositories for Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel - Requires the Secretary, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, to issue general guidelines for the recommendation of repository sites. Sets forth the contents of such guidelines. Requires the Secretary within 14 months after enactment of this Act, to recommend to the President at least three candidate sites, in at least two different geologic media, which are suitable for site characterization for repositories for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to recommend at least three additional candidate sites by February 1, 1985. Directs the Secretary to notify the Governor of the State in which a candidate site is located or the Indian tribe on whose reservation a candidate site is located. Requires the Secretary to hold public hearings to inform the residents of the area in which a candidate site is located of the proposed recommendation and to receive their comments before making such recommendation to the President. Requires the President to: (1) review each candidate site recommendation; (2) either approve or disapprove the recommendation within 60 days; and (3) transmit such decision to the Secretary and to the appropriate Governor or Indian tribe. Provides that the President's failure to approve or disapprove a candidate site within the 60-day period or to invoke authority to delay the determination shall be considered an approval. Requires the Secretary to carry out site characterization activities at each candidate site approved by the President. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and to either the State in which a candidate site is located or the Indian tribe on whose reservation such a site is located for review, before beginning site characterization activities: (1) an environmental assessment of the probable impacts of such activities; (2) a general plan for site characterization activities; and (3) proposals for the packaging of the waste and spent fuel to be emplaced in the repository. Directs the Secretary to make the required environmental assessment and site characterization plan available to the public and to hold public hearings on them. Provides for the Secretary to report periodically to the NRC and to the appropriate State or Indian tribe during the conduct of the site characterization activities. Restricts the Secretary's use of radioactive materials during site characterization activities. Prohibits the continuation of site characterization activities at a candidate site if the site is unsuitable for eventual development as a licensed repository or if such activities should be terminated for any other reason. Requires, upon termination, that: (1) the appropriate States or Indian tribes be notified; and (2) high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel at the candidate site be removed. Authorizes the Secretary to continue ongoing or presently planned site characterization at any Department of Energy site for which the location of the principal borehole was approved by August 1, 1982, subject to the consultation and cooperation requirements under this Act, if the Secretary determines that compliance with this subtitle will delay ongoing activities. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate State or Indian tribe of a decision to recommend approval of a candidate site upon completion of the public hearings and of the site characterization activities. Authorizes the Secretary to submit such recommendation to the President 30 days or more after such notification. Sets forth procedural requirements with respect to such recommendation.

Provides that persons entering into disposal contracts with the Secretary and any other persons desiring to dispose of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in repositories developed under this Act shall pay a ratable portion of the disposal costs involved. Prohibits the NRC from issuing or renewing a license for an individual to use a utilization or production facility unless such individual has entered into, or is negotiating with the Secretary for, a disposal contract. Prohibits the disposal of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste by the Secretary in any repository constructed under this Act unless the owner or generator of such spent fuel or waste has entered into a disposal contract by a specified date. Permits the assignment of the rights and duties of a party to a disposal contract with transfer of title to the spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste involved. Provides for the costs of the disposal of high-level radioactive waste from atomic energy defense activities to be paid by the Federal Government. Establishes in the Treasury a Nuclear Waste Fund which shall consist of: (1) receipts from disposal contracts; (2) appropriations made by Congress to the fund; and (3) any unexpended balances available on the enactment of this Act for functions or activities related to high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel disposal. Limits the use of the fund to radioactive waste disposal activities under this subtitle. Provides that delivery, and acceptance by the Secretary, of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel at a repository constructed under this Act shall constitute a transfer of title to the waste or spent fuel. Terminates the authority under this subtitle with respect to judicial review and expedited authorizations at the time a repository developed under this subtitle is licensed to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to give full consideration to the effect of any acquisition of water rights required by the establishment of a repository. Subtitle B: Interim Storage Program - Directs the Secretary, the NRC, and other Federal officials to encourage and expedite the effective use of available storage and necessary additional storage at civilian nuclear reactor sites. Requires the Secretary to establish a commercialization program to assist the development by the private sector of alternate technologies for the storage of civilian spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor sites, including alternate technologies which can be adopted by the NRC on a generic basis without the need (to the maximum extent practicable) for additional site-specific approvals by the NRC. Sets forth the procedural rules which shall govern NRC hearings on applications for licenses or license amendments, filed after the enactment of this Act, to expand spend nuclear fuel storage capacity at civilian nuclear reactor sites. Permits a person filing such an application with the NRC after the enactment of this Act to petition the NRC for issuance of such license or license amendment on an interim basis before the conduct or completion of any required hearing on the application. Requires the NRC to grant an interim license or license amendment if: (1) in all respects other than the required hearing, all legal requirements are met; (2) the activities authorized by the interim license or license amendment will provide adequate protection to the public health and safety and the environment during the interim period; and (3) refusal to grant such petition will prevent the petitioner from maintaining a full core reserve storage capability at the nuclear reactor site involved. Prohibits the NRC from issuing an interim license or license amendment for the first application to expand onsite spent fuel storage capacity through the use of a new technology not previously approved by the NRC. Directs the Secretary to provide up to 2800 metric tons of storage capacity for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear reactors. Authorizes the Secretary to contract with an owner or generator of spent nuclear fuel to provide storage capacity for the spent fuel if: (1) adequate storage capacity cannot be provided at the nuclear reactor site where the spent fuel is being generated or at any other nuclear reactor site owned by such person; and (2) such person is pursuing licensed alterntives to Federal storage capacity. Requires the removal of spent nuclear fuel stored under the interim storage program as soon as practicable after a repository developed under this Act becomes available. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on plans to provide storage capacity under this Act. Requires the NRC to establish procedures and criteria for determining the adequacy of spent nuclear fuel storage capacity available to owners or generators of spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to make available Federal storage facilities for transuranic waste from decommissioning and decontamination of civilian nuclear facilities and from civilian fuel research and development programs. Provides for the Secretary to take title to such waste upon receipt and to charge reasonable fees for such storage. Directs the Secretary to require generators or owners of transuranic waste to enter into contracts providing that they will pay an estimated pro rata share of the costs of disposal in a repository or other facility in addition to the storage fee. Requires the Secretary to remove the transuranic waste from the storage facilities as soon as practicable after a repository or other facility becomes available. Prohibits the Secretary from providing storage for transuranic waste on the date on which a repository or other facility becomes available for transuranic waste disposal or six years after the NRC issues final regulations establishing criteria for the licensing of civilian transuranic waste disposal facilities, whichever date occurs first. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue standards and the NRC to issue such final regulations within two years after enactment of this Act. Provides that the Secretary's acceptance of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste shall not constitute a transfer of title to such fuel or waste. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a report establishing fees, calculated annually, for storage of spent nuclear fuel. Requires persons entering into storage contracts with the Secretary to pay a pro-rated portion of the storage costs involved. Prohibits the storage of spent nuclear fuel generated or owned by a Federal agency in storage capacity provided under this Act unless the agency transfers to the Secretary an amount equal to the fees required of any party to a storage contract. Establishes in the Treasury the Interim Storage Fund which shall consist of: (1) receipts from storage contracts; (2) appropriations made by Congress to the fund; and (3) any unexpended balances available on the enactment of this Act for functions or activities related to the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. Authorizes the Secretary to use the fund to cover the costs of the interim storage program, including: (1) the development, licensing, operation, and decommissioning of interim storage facilities; (2) administrative costs; and (3) design, operation, and construction costs of interim storage facilities. Title II: Other Provisions relating to Radioactive Waste - Subtitle A: Alternative Means of Financing - Directs the Secretary to study, and report to Congress on, alternative approaches to managing the construction and operation of all civilian radioactive waste management facilities. Subtitle B: Low-Level Radioactive Waste - Requires the NRC to ensure that licensees providing for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste provide adequate financial arrangements to permit disposal site closure and reclamation of sites, structures, and equipment. Authorizes the Secretary to assume title and custody of low-level radioactive waste and the disposal site, upon the owner's request and after termination of the disposal license, if: (1) the NRC's requirements for site closure, decommissioning, and decontamination have been met by the licensee involved; (2) such title and custody will be transferred to the Secretary without cost to the Government; and (3) Federal ownership and mangement of the site will protect the public health and safety and the environment. Requires the Secretary to assume title and custody of low-level radioactive waste and the disposal site, upon the owner's request, once the site has been decontaminated and stabilized and the owner has paid for the long-term maintenance and monitoring of the site, if the waste is a result of a licensed activity to recover zirconium, hafnium, and rare earths from source material. Subtitle C: Repository Advisory Review Commission - Authorizes the Secretary to establish the Repository Advisory Review Commission to the Department of Energy.
