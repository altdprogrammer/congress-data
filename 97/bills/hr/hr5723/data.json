    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for specified maritime programs of the Department of Transportation, including: (1) operating-differential subsidies; (2) research and development; (3) operations and training; and (4) the acquisition of three C-6 type vessels for the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Authorizes supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in salaries and employee benefits. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to increase from $12,000,000,000 to $15,000,000,000 the funds available for obligation guarantees for commercial demonstration ocean thermal energy conversion facilities or plantships. Declares that no application for such guarantees shall be denied or deferred if it meets the standards and criteria of such Act. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, to prohibit, after December 31, 1983 (or after an appropriate vessel has been constructed and documented), the transportation of hazardous waste by a foreign-flag vessel from a point in the United States for the purpose of incineration at sea. Exempts from this provision any foreign-flag vessel owned by or under construction on May 1, 1982 for a corporation wholly owned by a U.S. citzen. Subjects such vessels to specified inspection requirements. Authorizes the documentation of a named vessel with the privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade."
