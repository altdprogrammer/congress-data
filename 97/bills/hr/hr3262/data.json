Limits the amount of such award to $20,000 for any one civil action. Includes within the definition of \"attorney's fees\" amounts paid to an individual who is not an attorney but who is authorized to practice before the Tax Court. Defines \"prevailing party\" as a party who: (1) establishes that the position of the United States in the civil action was unreasonable; and (2) substantially prevails with respect to the amount in controversy or the most significant issue or set of issues. Disallows costs for certain civil actions involving declaratory judgments."
