Sets forth procedures by which a State may acquire by purchase or condemnation lawfully erected signs or related devices. Increases the Federal share of such acquisitions from 75 to 80 percent. Specifies criteria for an effective statewide system of control over such signs and devices. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the States, to provide areas adjacent to the Interstate Highway System for placement of specified signs and devices. States that such signs shall conform to national standards promulgated by the Secretary. Authorizes a State, with the approval of the Secretary, to establish information centers at safety rest areas and other travel information systems within a highway's right-of-way."
