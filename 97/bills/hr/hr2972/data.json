    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-04-01", 
    "text": "Criminal Justice Assistance Amendments of 1981 - Amends title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Justice System Improvement) to replace the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration with a new Bureau of Justice Assistance (the \"Administration\") under the general authority of the Attorney General. Revises the formula grant program to make the following changes. Decreases from 23 to seven the purposes for which formula grants may be made. Authorizes the Administrator of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, after consultation with the Congressional judiciary committees, to add up to three specific purposes for funding to States. Authorizes States during fiscal years 1983 and 1984 to fund five additional program areas given the highest priority by the National Justice Commission. Requires States to provide a 50 percent match to receive Federal funding and to assume the cost of a successful program after a reasonable period of Federal assistance. Authorizes the Administrator to waive the required match if the recipient does not have sufficient funds available. Eliminates the current requirement that States and localities establish criminal justice councils and local criminal justice advisory boards. Requires each State to maintain a State planning agency subject to the jurisdiction of the chief executive of the State. Charges such agencies with: (1) preparing a simple application to obtain a State's allocation; (2) administering funds awarded; (3) providing financial assistance to State agencies, local governments, and private nonprofit corporations; (4) preparing annual reports; (5) coordinating the policies of State and local criminal justice agencies; and (6) analyzing criminal justice data. Authorizes the chief executive officer of the State to submit the State's proposed uses of the block grants to the State legislature. Increases from 80 to 95 percent the proportion of total funding to be allocated for formula grants. Eliminates the national priority grant and the training and manpower development programs. Establishes a 21-member National Justice Commission in the executive branch to: (1) coordinate the activities of Federal agencies which impact on crime; (2) coordinate the activities and policies of Federal, State, and local criminal justice agencies; and (3) identify and recommend to Federal agencies, the President, and Congress criminal justice priority areas and policies. Requires that 14 members of the Commission be representative of State and local government interests. Directs the Commission to: (1) publish in the Federal Register by March 15, 1982, a list of criminal justice problems which should receive priority attention by Federal, State, and local governments; and (2) communicate to Congress by such date a list of priority recommendations. Restricts the purposes of the discretionary grant program. Includes among its purposes meeting criminal justice emergency situations beyond the capacity of State and local governments. Decreases from ten to five percent the proportion of total funding to be allocated for discretionary grants, but authorizes Congress to appropriate additional funds to meet emergency situations. Permits Federal funding for up to 100 percent of program costs. Directs the Administrator of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to report annually to the President and the Congressional judiciary committees on activities under this title. Eliminates the detailed reporting requirements currently prescribed. Decreases from $750,000,000 to $75,000,000 the amount authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 1981 and 1982 for the grant programs and the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Authorizes $125,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1983 and 1984 for such purposes. Eliminates the current authorization of appropriations for the Office of Community Anti-Crime Programs and the requirement that at least 19.15 percent of total appropriations be maintained for juvenile delinquency programs."
