Applies provisions of Federal law governing step increases, pay comparability adjustments, and hazardous duty differentials for civil service positions to Federal firefighter positions. Awards a firefighter who earns a bachelor or associate degree in fire sciences a step increase in addition to any increase to which the employee is otherwise entitled. Exempts firefighters from provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act requiring payment of a minimum wage and payment of overtime for hours of work exceeding 40 hours a week. Includes the premium pay received by firefighters as basic pay for purposes of computing their civil service retirement benefits."
