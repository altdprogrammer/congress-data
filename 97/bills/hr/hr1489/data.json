Terminates such authority within 270 days after notification that a United States passenger vessel has a Certificate of Financial Responsibility for Indemnification of Passengers for Nonperformance of Transportation from the Federal Maritime Commission to provide such service. Provides for a 90-day extension of the 270-day period if the certified vessel has not entered the coastwise passenger trade. Authorizes the reinstatement of the displaced service if the service of the certified vessel is no longer available. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to define the term \"passenger vessel\" taking into consideration the Caribbean passenger trades."
