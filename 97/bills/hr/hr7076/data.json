    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries with amendment, H.Rept. 97-934(Part I)) Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to permit suspension (with a discretionary lease extension) of exploration activity. Makes permit delays which are not the fault of the lessee grounds for such action. Requires Federal agencies to act on license or permit applications within 90 days, or to notify the applicant and the Secretary of the Interior of the reasons for delay. Deems any license or permit approved when neither the deadline is met nor a notification of reasons for delay is made. Provides with regard to oil and gas leases that: (1) cash bids must (presently may) be deposited in interest bearing accounts until a final choice has been made; (2) notice of any lease sale shall be published in the Federal Register 60 (presently 30) days before such sale; and (3) bids may be accepted from a person making a \"good faith\" effort (rather than \"due diligence\") to meet \"due diligence\" requirements under another such lease. Requires lessee overpayments to be repaid (or a credit provided for) upon request filed within two years. Eliminates related reporting requirements. Prohibits civil action to enjoin a lease sale unless filed within 45 days of notice of such sale in the Federal Register. Revises criminal penalties to provide separate penalties for specified violations. Eliminates the requirement that lessees and permittees provide access to interpreted data and information. Eliminates specified annual oil and gas well reports. Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior conduct a continuing investigation of outer continental shelf oil and gas resources."
