    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1982-08-19", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-779) Intelligence Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 1983 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities in specified departments and agencies of the U.S. Government. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1983. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 210 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability Fund. Title IV: Supplemental Authorization for the Fiscal Year 1982 - Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1982 for the conduct of intelligence activities of the U.S. Government. Allows the CIA to exceed the ceiling on civilian employees in limited circumstances. Title V: Provisions Related to Intelligence Agencies - Prohibits the unauthorized use of the name, initials, or seal of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Makes certain provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act relating to the procurement of automatic data processing equipment inapplicable to CIA procurement. Title VI: Retirement Benefits for Certain Former Spouses of Central Intelligence Agency Employees - Central Intelligence Agency Spouses' Retirement Equity Act of 1982 - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to include among the persons entitled to receive annuities from the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund a former spouse who was married to a CIA employee entitled to such annuities (a participant) for at least ten years during such employee's periods of creditable service, at least five years of which the participant and the former spouse spent outside the United States. Provides that a retired participant who is married, or has a former spouse who has not remarried before age 60, shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for his or her spouse or former spouse. Permits a married participant and spouse to elect jointly to waive a survivor annuity for such spouse, or to reduce the amount of the survivor annuity. Permits a participant and his or her former spouse to elect jointly by spousal agreement to waive a survivor annuity for the former spouse. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to prescribe regulations under which a participant may make such elections independently if the participant cannot discover the whereabouts of his or her spouse or former spouse. Limits the amount of the annuity for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse. Requires that a survivor annuity terminated because of remarriage be restored at the same rate on the date such remarriage is dissolved if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund. Prohibits the entitlement of a participant's surviving former spouse to a survivor annuity from the fund unless the surviving former spouse elects to receive it instead of any other survivor benefits to which he or she may be entitled on the basis of another marriage. Requires a married annuitant who reverts to retired status with entitlement to a supplemental annuity under such Act to have the supplemental annuity reduced by ten percent to provide a supplemental survivor annuity for his or her spouse, unless the annuitant and spouse jointly elect to the contrary. Provides for such a supplemental survivor annuity in any case in which a participant has a former spouse who was married to the participant during a period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under this Act. Provides for the recomputation of an annuity which is reduced to provide a survivor benefit for a spouse if the participant's marriage to that spouse is dissolved. Permits a participant to elect irrevocably, within one year of a remarriage, to receive again a reduced annuity in order to provide a survivor annuity for the new spouse. Requires that such reduction be equal to the reduction in effect before the dissolution of the previous marriage. Makes such a reduction effective the first day of the first month one year after the date of the remarriage. Requires the Director, on an annual basis, to inform participants of their rights of election, and spouses and former spouses of their rights. Sets forth the rules for computation of annuities for former spouses of participants. Disqualifies a former spouse from receiving an annuity if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age. Provides for the commencement of an annuity for a former spouse on the later of: (1) the day the participant becomes entitled to an annuity; or (2) the first day of the month in which the dissolution of the marriage becomes final. Provides for the termination of an annuity for a former spouse on: (1) the last day of the month before the former spouse dies or remarries before age 60; or (2) the date the participant's annuity terminates. Requires that a participant's annuity be reduced by the amount of the annuity paid to any former spouse. Provides that if a participant whose annuity is so reduced is recalled to service or reemployed, such person's salary shall be reduced by the same amount. Sets forth rules for the commencement and calculation of annuities for former spouses of disability annuitants. Sets forth the rules for the computation of survivor annuities for former spouses. Disqualifies a former spouse from receiving a survivor annuity if before the commencement of the annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 60 years of age. Provides for the commencement of a survivor annuity for a former spouse on the day after the annuitant dies. Provides for its termination on the last day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage before age 60. Permits the restoration of a survivor annuity terminated because of remarriage on the date the remarriage is dissolved if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund. Prohibits the adjustment by court order of the amount of a survivor annuity for a former spouse after the participant's death. Provides for the recomputation of an annuity which is reduced to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse if the former spouse dies or remarries before age 60. Restricts the amount available for a survivor annuity for another individual once a survivor annuity has been provided for any former spouse. Permits a participant to elect, or agree to, an additional survivor annuity for other former spouses or a surviving spouse if the participant passes a physical examination. Limits the total amount of survivor annuities which a participant may provide from his or her annuity. Specifies the methods for providing survivor annuities for former spouses and spouses. Permits a participant to elect, by spousal agreement, to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse who is not eligible for survivorship benefits under this Act. Sets forth rules for the payment to a former spouse of a portion of any lump-sum payment for retirement contributions to which a participant who separates from the Agency after at least five years but before becoming eligible for an annuity is entitled. Reduces a participant's lump-sum payment by the amount paid to his or her former spouse. Permits the Director to pay such lump-sum payment to a participant only upon receipt of an express written waiver of the participant's current spouse. Applies the retirement contributions deducted after the participant has completed 35 years of service toward any special contribution required to obtain CIA retirement credit for prior civilian service, with the balance to be refunded in a lump sum to the participant upon separation, subject to the notification and consent of a spouse or former spouse. Authorizes a participant to use such sums to provide for an additional annuity or other elective benefits. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to entitle a qualified former spouse of an Agency employee who is a participant in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System to a specified portion of the employee's annuity and to a survivor annuity under such system. Requires the administration of such benefits in a manner comparable to the manner in which benefits for former spouses are administered under the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to issue regulations to implement such provisions. Title VII: General Provisions - States that authorization of appropriations under this Act shall not constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Allows for increases in employee benefits which are authorized by law."
