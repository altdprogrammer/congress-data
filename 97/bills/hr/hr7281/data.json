Transfers to such Offices the functions of specified existing audit and investigation offices of such Departments. Specifies duties of each Inspector General which are in addition to duties prescribed under such Act. Prohibits any such Inspector General from including in a semiannual report to Congress information which is: (1) prohibited from disclosure by any law; (2) protected from disclosure by executive order; or (3) part of an ongoing criminal investigation that has not been included in a public record. Declares that no member of the Armed Forces shall be appointed as Inspector General of the Department of Defense. Places such Inspector General under the control of the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Secretary to transmit to Congress an explanation of any determination to prohibit the Inspector General from conducting an investigation or audit or from issuing a subpoena. Declares that the Inspector General of the Department of Justice is not authorized to conduct audits or reviews concerning policy decisions of Department officials with respect to law enforcement, litigation, legal advice, and corrections. Requires such Inspector General to inform the Attorney General before issuing a subpoena. Prohibits the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury, except when requested by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, from reviewing policy decisions concerning law enforcement, banking regulatory, financial, monetary, tax, or international activities of the Department.
