    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 97-104 (Part III)) Water Resources Policy Act of 1981 - States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to expand or diminish either Federal or State jurisdiction, responsibility, or rights in the field of water resources planning, development, or control. Title I: National Board - Establishes a National Board on Water Resources Policy which shall: (1) assess the adequacy of water supplies in the United States; and (2) maintain a continuing study of the relation of regional or river basin plans and programs to the requirements of larger regions of the United States. Requires the Board to meet at least once during each quarter of the year. Directs the Board to establish principles and procedures for Federal participants in the preparation of comprehensive regional or river basin plans and for the formulation and evaluation of Federal water and related land resources projects. Requires that such principles and procedures prohibit Federal water resources agencies from preparing a regional or river basin plan or a plan for any Federal water and related land resource project which has as the objective the transfer of water from the Columbia River basin, or any other major river basin, to another region or major river basin. Directs the Board to establish separate principles and procedures for small Federal water or related land resources projects. Establishes a regional-State water resources advisory committee. Authorizes such committee to submit to the Board its recommendations on any matter that is before the Board. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of the committee for fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984. Directs the Board to submit copies of its rules relating to principles, standards, and procedures for Federal participants in the preparation of comprehensive regional or river basin plans to the Senate and House of Representatives. Provides for veto of such proposed rule by both Houses of Congress by concurrent resolution within 90 days after promulgation, or by one House within 60 days after promulgation, if the other House does not disapprove such resolution within 30 days after its transmittal. Title II: River Basin Commissions - Establishes river basin commissions, pursuant to a Presidential declaration requested by the Board, responsible for water and related land resources within a basin. Sets forth criteria for such requests. Describes the duties of such commissions under this Act. Allows a commission to terminate itself upon decision of a majority of the States composing such commission. Directs each commission to report at least annually to the Board. Title III: Assistance for State Water Planning - Establishes a program of financial and program assistance to the States for: (1) the development, implementation, and modification of State water management programs; (2) the establishment and implementation of water conservation technical assistance programs; and (3) the development of comprehensive water and related land resources plans. Sets forth procedures by which the Board shall make allotments to the States. Directs the Board to approve, according to specified criteria, water management and conservation programs and comprehensive water and related land resource plans submitted by the Governors. Lists information to be included in each program submitted by a Governor. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984. Title IV: General Provisions - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, to study the water resources needs of various river basins and other regions of the United States. Requires that such study be reported to Congress by October 1, 1983. Repeals the Water Resources Planning Act. Continues the Mississippi River Basin Commission for the purpose of completing the comprehensive master plan for the management of the Upper Mississippi River System. Requires the Board to assist in interagency coordination of Federal water resources research and to report annually to Congress thereon. Directs the Board to make use of The Water Resources Scientific Information Center in giving such assistance."
