Requires each Federal agency with a research and development budget in excess of $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1982 or any subsequent fiscal year to spend a specified percentage of its budget in connection with an SBIR program. Requires each Federal agency with a research and development budget in excess of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1982 or any subsequent fiscal year to establish specific goals for funding research and development agreements with small businesses. Directs each Federal agency with an SBIR program to report annually to the SBA the number of awards over $10,000 in amount made under the SBIR program and to concerns other than small business concerns. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, in conjunction with the SBA, to promulgate regulations for the conduct of the SBIR programs.
