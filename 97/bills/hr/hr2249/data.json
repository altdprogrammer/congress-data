    "text": "Ports and Navigation Improvement Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to undertake navigation improvements to: (1) Norfolk Harbor and Channels, Virginia; (2) Mobile Harbor, Alabama; and (3) deep-draft access to the Ports of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Requires the Chief of Engineers, within one year of the date of enactment, to submit to Congress a final environmental impact statement for each such project demonstrating compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Clean Water Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and other pertinent statutory requirements. Deems the requirements of such statutes to have been satisfied unless Congress disapproves such final environmental impact statement by concurrent resolution within 60 days. Authorizes the Chief of Engineers to develop, improve, and maintain the Nation's rivers, harbors, and other waterways, at such depths and dimensions and with such facilities to insure the safe and efficient conduct of defense transportation or foreign and domestic commerce. Requires the Chief of Engineers, prior to initiation of any such work, to submit to Congress a final environmental impact statement for such improvements. Requires each such statement to be submitted to Congress within one year of the date of the completion of the draft environmental impact statement. Declares that the absence of Congressional disapproval shall constitute a determination that all environmental statutes have been satisfied. Declares that environmental impact statements for such projects and improvements authorized by this Act, findings and determinations by Congress, and actions to carry out such projects and improvements shall not be subject to judicial review except for claims alleging: (1) invalidity of this Act; (2) inadequacy of a final environmental impact statement; or (3) unconstitutionality. Gives exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. district courts for the district where the improvement is located. Gives docket priority to such proceedings in such courts. Authorizes necessary appropriations. Authorizes the transfer of Department of the Army civil funds until such appropriation."
