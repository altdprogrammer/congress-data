Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $1,000 ($2,000 for married individuals filing jointly). Requires the recapture of specified amounts of such credit if any securities for which the credit is allowed are disposed of by the taxpayer within one year of their purchase. Disqualifies estates, trusts, and nonresident aliens from eligibility for the credit."
