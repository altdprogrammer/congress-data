    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1982-09-20", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Wolf Trap Farm Park Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to make available to the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts for the reconstruction of the Filene Center in Wolf Trap Farm Park: (1) a grant of $9,000,000 to be provided in increments as needed and only if the Foundation agrees to provide contributions from non-Federal sources to complete the reconstruction; and (2) loans in an amount equal to twice the amount of non-Federal contributions received, but not to exceed $8,000,000, to be repaid in full with interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury plus any additional charge needed to cover the costs of servicing the loan. Prohibits the term of any such loan from exceeding five years. Requires the Foundation to agree, as a condition of receiving such assistance, to: (1) expend all funds for the reconstruction of the Filene Center in accordance with appropriate Office of Management and Budget circulars and the Davis-Bacon Act; (2) comply with the Secretary's terms; and (3) maintain insurance on the Filene Center during the period of the cooperative agreement required by this Act. Makes repairs or reconstruction carried out with insurance proceeds subject to the Secretary's approval. Makes the Secretary responsible for overseeing the reconstruction and for giving final approval of the plans for, and location and design of, the Filene Center. Requires the Foundation to manage the construction activities. Prohibits grants or loans from being made under this Act, unless the Secretary has received written assurance from the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) that any easement granted to the Commonwealth of Virginia for construction of the Dulles Toll Road will contain: (1) conditions legally enforceable by the Administrator and the Secretary to protect the park from undue noise, air pollution, and visual degradation; and (2) legally enforceable assurances that the Commonwealth will enforce such conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to provide support services for reconstruction, upon request by the Foundation, on a reimbursable basis. Directs the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Foundation for the presentation of performing arts and related educational and cultural programs at the Filene Center. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical and financial assistance under such agreement. Requires the Foundation to maintain insurance on the Filene Center and to maintain its nonprofit, tax-exempt status as conditions of entering into such agreement. Provides that, pursuant to the cooperative agreement, the Secretary and the Comptroller General shall have access to the Foundation's permanent books and records for audit and other purposes and the Foundation shall submit an annual report to the Secretary and the appropriate congressional committees. Permits the cooperative agreement to be terminated at the Government's convenience if it is required in the public interest. Provides that the agreement dated September 16, 1980, between the National Park Service and the Foundation, shall remain in effect until terminated under its terms or until the cooperative agreement is entered into under this Act. Provides that all right, title, and interest in the Filene Center shall vest in the United States. Requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees quarterly reports on the progress of the reconstruction of the Filene Center, following disbursement of any grant under this Act. Directs the Secretary and Federal, State, and local agencies to cooperate with each other to protect the park from undue noise intrusions, air pollution, and visual degradation. Requires the Secretary to monitor air and noise pollution within the park associated with the Dulles road corridor and to notify the Administrator of the FAA if the air or noise pollution exceeds the standards in the easement for the Dulles Toll Road. Requires the Administrator to reduce the air or noise pollution within 60 days after such notification. Permits the Secretary or the Foundation to bring an action to enjoin any violation of the easement by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Requires a general management plan for the park to be prepared and periodically revised by the Director of the National Park Service and to be submitted to specified congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for making the grant and the loans. Makes the authority to enter into contracts or to make payments under this Act effective only to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriations Acts."
