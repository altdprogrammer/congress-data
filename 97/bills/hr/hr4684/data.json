Sets forth a formula for the reduction of annual rates in any pay period in which the Consumer Price Index reported a percentage increase during the preceding pay period. Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to repeal the authority of the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries to review the rates of pay of Members of Congress."
