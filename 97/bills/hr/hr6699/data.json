    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations to ensure that the use, reuse, recycling, and reclamation of hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner consistent with protection of human health and the environment. Requires notification to the Administrator by: (1) the owner or operator of any facility producing a fuel from any hazardous waste alone or with other material or from used oil alone or with other material; (2) the owner or operator of any facility burning fuel containing any hazardous waste or used oil; and (3) any person who distributes or markets fuel containing hazardous waste or used oil. Requires that such notification describe the location, the facility, the identified or listed hazardous waste involved, and the production or energy recovery activity. Exempts facilities, such as residential boilers, from such notification requirements where the Administrator determines that such notification is not necessary for obtaining sufficient information respecting current practices of facilities using hazardous waste for energy recovery. Directs the Administrator, within two years after the enactment of this Act, to promulgate regulations establishing health and environmental standards applicable to owners or operators of facilities producing fuel from hazardous wastes or burning hazardous wastes for energy recovery and to distributors or marketers of such fuels."
