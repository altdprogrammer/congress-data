Provides for the appointment of an Executive Director and a General Counsel for the Administration. Amends part B (Professional Standards Review) of title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize the Administration to waive any or all of the reviews, certification, or similar activities required under title XVIII with respect to health care services if it finds such activities are not needed based on substantial evidence of the effective performance of review and control activities by Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO's). Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consult with the Administration in correlating the functions of the PSRO's and other agencies and in determining the amount of funds for administration of part B of title XI of the Social Security Act payable from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.

Title II: Miscellaneous and Conforming Amendments - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to prohibit the inclusion of material unrelated to title II or title XVIII of such Act or containing the name, signature, or title of an officer of the U.S. Government with any benefit check.
