    "text": "Exclusive Economic Zone Establishment Act - Title I: Establishment of, and Rights Asserted Regarding, the Exclusive Economic Zone - Establishes a 200 mile (adjacent to the territorial sea) U.S. exclusive economic zone. Requires persons wishing to conduct marine research in such zone to submit a plan to the Secretary of State. Permits the Secretary to prohibit research that would adversely affect national security or defense. Requires: (1) affected Federal agencies to report recommendations for changes in laws in accordance with this Act to the President; and (2) the President to report his or her recommendations to Congress within two years. Title II: Exploration for, and Exploitation of Mineral Resources of the Exclusive Economic Zone, Outer Continental Shelf and Deep Seabed - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to redefine \"Outer Continental Shelf\" to include a distance of 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea or the foot of the continental slope, whichever is greater. Renames the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act the Deep Seabed Mineral Resources Act. Eliminates specified references to the Law of the Sea Treaty. Prohibits permits for new commercial recovery activities before January 1, 1985 (presently January 1, 1988). Authorizes appropriations through FY 1987. Renames the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Removal Tax Act of 1979 (Internal Revenue Code) the Deep Seabed Mineral Removal Tax Act of 1979. Eliminates references to an international deep seabed treaty, including a treaty-related tax termination date imposed on the removal of mineral resources. Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to issue a memorandum of understanding regarding certain mining operations on both the outer continental shelf and the deep seabed. Title III: Fishery Conservation and Management - Amends Federal law to state that the United States shall exercise sole fishery management authority (except with regard to highly migratory fishes) within the exclusive economic zone."
