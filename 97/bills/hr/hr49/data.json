    "text": "Amends the National Labor Relations Act to permit a labor organization, employer, or ten percent of the members of the appropriate bargaining unit to request a referendum regarding a potential or existing strike. Makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to call or maintain a strike if a majority of employees voting in such a referendum vote not to strike or if such a referendum is requested before a strike begins and the results have not yet been certified. Prohibits the National Labor Relations Board, in determining whether or not a question of union representation exists (thus determining whether an election by secret ballot must be held), from requiring that a petitioning employer has a reasonable or good faith doubt that the individual or labor organization claiming representation has majority support. Authorizes any person aggrieved by a final decision of the Board certifying, decertifying, or dismissing a petition for certification or decertification to obtain judicial review of such decision in an appropriate circuit court of appeals. Establishes procedures for such appeals."
