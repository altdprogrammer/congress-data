Permits the Secretary, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to recommend particular projects to grant or contract applicants. Requires that 25 percent of project costs be provided from non-Federal sources. Makes the Secretary and Administrator responsible for formulating a general national tree planting and harvesting program along the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, the Federal Aid Primary System, the Federal Aid Secondary System, and the Federal Aid Urban System. Requires a proposal to provide for maximum utilization of small businesses. Requires each project under this Act to be performed by contracts to small businesses unless a State agency finds that another method is in the public interest. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the SBA and Department of the Interior to report annually to the President and Congress on activities under this Act."
