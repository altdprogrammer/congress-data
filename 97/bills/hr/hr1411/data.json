States that such agreements: (1) shall provide for disclosure by the Commissioner to such credit organizations of information concerning the defaulting borrower's address and other relevant information; and (2) may provide for similar disclosures by such credit organizations to the Commissioner. Directs the Commissioner, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, to establish a system for the prompt notification to a defaulting borrower of any disclosure made under this Act. Includes notice of such system of disclosure to credit organizations among the terms of the written agreement evidencing: (1) a federally-guaranteed student loan made more than 180 days after enactment of this Act; (2) subsidy payments for such loans to State and nonprofit private institutions made more than 180 days after enactment of this Act; (3) Federal contributions to an institution for direct student loans; and (4) a direct student loan to an eligible student from his or her institution made more than 180 days after enactment of this Act."
