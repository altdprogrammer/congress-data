Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to refer to the Council, upon request, any question of scientific fact arising in an adjudication under such Act which involves the harm any food, drug, device, pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive may cause to human health and which is relevant to determining whether an application is approvable, the approval of an application should be withdrawn, or whether a prohibited act has been committed. Makes the decision of such Council the final decision of the agency with respect to such question. Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to refer to the Council, upon request, any question of scientific fact which involves the harm a pesticide or an active ingredient may cause to human health and which is relevant to determining whether the classification of such pesticide should be changed or the registration of such pesticide should be refused, suspended, or canceled. Makes the decision of such Council the final decision of such agency with respect to such question. Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to refer to the Council, upon request, any question of scientific fact which involves the harm any meat, meat food product, or carcass may cause to human health and which is relevant to determining whether such meat, meat product, or carcass is adulterated or misbranded.
