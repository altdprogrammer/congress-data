    "text": "Amends the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, before approving or disapproving rent increases for certain federally-assisted housing projects, to consider whether the mortgagor could control increases in utility costs by securing more favorable utility rates or by taking cost-effective actions to reduce energy consumption. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to adjust the proposed rent increase upon determining the mortgagor could exercise such control; and (2) to provide financial assistance to a mortgagor to upgrade the project to satisfy energy efficiency standards prescribed by the Secretary."
