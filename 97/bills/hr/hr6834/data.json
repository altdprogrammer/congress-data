Provides for a waiver of such prohibition by a three-fifths vote of the Congress (or by a majority vote) during a national emergency or declaration of war. Requires inclusion in the budget of budget authority for and revenues from all activities of the Federal Government, except revenues derived from borrowing and outlays for repayment of debt principal."
