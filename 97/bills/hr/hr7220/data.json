Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing any license or authorization for the export of any nuclear materials, equipment, or technology to South Africa. States that the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 may not be used to distribute any nuclear material, source material, or byproduct material to South Africa. Prohibits any U.S. agency or official from permitting the transfer to, or use by, South Africa of nuclear material, equipment, or technology. Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from authorizing any activity which would constitute engaging in the production of special nuclear material in South Africa. Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from issuing an export license for any goods or technology which: (1) are intended for a nuclear related end use or end user; (2) have been identified as items which could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes; or (3) are otherwise subject to certain procedures of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. Requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Secretaries of Commerce, Energy, and State to prepare lists of goods and technology transferable to South Africa notwithstanding the provisons of this Act which could help that country develop a nuclear capability. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit the export of such goods and technology. Prohibits any officer or employee of the executive branch from making available to South Africa any technology or other information which could increase that country's nuclear capability. Terminates any license or authorization described in this Act which was issued before enactment of this Act."
