    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Federal Court Reform Act of 1982 - Title I: Supreme Court Review - Makes review of a Federal district or appellate court or highest State Court decision which holds a Federal or State law unconstitutional reviewable by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari, instead of appeal as currently authorized. Authorizes Supreme Court review, by writ of certiorari, of final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in a case where the validity of a treaty or statute is in question or where the validity of a statute of Puerto Rico is in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Amends various provisions of Federal law (including the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, and the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973) to provide that certain cases will now be heard by the Supreme Court under its discretionary certiorari authority instead of hearing such appeals directly. Title II: Jurors and Summons for Jury Service - Provides workmen's compensation for individuals injured during Federal jury duty. Authorizes the award of attorney's fees in cases involving appointed counsel where an employee has brought suit against his or her employer because the employer discriminated against the employee on the basis of jury service. Permits the use of first class mail to notify individuals of jury service. Title III: Civil Priorities - Requires each court of the United States to determine the order in which civil actions are heard and determined. Authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to modify the rules adopted by the courts in order to establish consistency. Amends over 80 priority or expediting provisions relating to civil actions."
