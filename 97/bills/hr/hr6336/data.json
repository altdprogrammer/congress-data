Provides that in the case of private lands within the recreation area, such program may be undertaken only with the owner's consent and shall be contingent upon the owner maintaining program measures for at least ten years. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1987 for the program. Limits the authority under this Act to enter into contracts or to make payments to the extent and amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Makes the authorization of new budget authority under this Act effective only for fiscal years after September 30, 1982."
