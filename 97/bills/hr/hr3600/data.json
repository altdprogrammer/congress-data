Establishes a Great Lakes Protection program under title II of such Act. Establishes within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a Great Lakes Research Office, to be directed by an Executive Director to be appointed by the Administrator of NOAA. Requires the Executive Director to compile, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, an inventory of all major actions of the Federal, State, and local governments since 1977 which have significantly affected (or may so affect) the Great Lakes. Requires that such inventory be submitted to the Congress and the President and be updated at least once every three months. Requires the Executive Director, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, to report, with recommendations, to the President and the Congress on: (1) current Federal efforts to improve the Great Lakes' environmental quality; and (2) the degree of coordination among the States to preserve and protect such quality. Sets forth other responsibilities of the Executive Director. Requires that all Federal agencies include Great Lakes environmental impact analyses in their recommendations or reports for major Federal actions significantly affecting the Great Lakes. Sets forth provisions relating to such analyses, including a requirement that copies be available to the President and to the public. Revises provisions relating to interagency cooperation, dissemination of information, and effect on other laws. Extends through FY 1984 the authorization of appropriations to carry out the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978. Reserves a specified amount of such appropriations to be obligated and expended on the Great Lakes Research Office in each fiscal year ending after September 30, 1982."
