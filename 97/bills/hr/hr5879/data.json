Expresses the intent of Congress that self-sufficiency is the goal of such assistance. Requires the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to: (1) study the feasibility of providing interim support through the case management system and separating medical assistance from cash assistance; and (2) report to Congress by January 1, 1983. Requires the Director to implement resettlement policies dealing with the problems of initial resettlement concentration and consultation among governmental officials and representatives of the sponsoring voluntary agencies. Requires the Director to maintain data on refugee dependency and secondary migration within the United States. Amends initial resettlement provisions to require sponsoring agencies to: (1) use or obligate all Federal funds in the fiscal year they are received; (2) notify welfare agencies of jobs offered to refugees; and (3) assure that refugees with known health problems report to the appropriate health agencies. Authorizes the Director to reimburse State and local health agencies for providing medical screening and initial treatment to refugees. Requires the Government Accounting Office to conduct annual grant and contract audits. Authorizes the Secretary to fully reimburse States for cash and medical assistance provided refugees during their first 36 months in the United States. Includes job or language training as an eligibility requirement for cash assistance. Terminates such assistance (after opportunity for hearing) if a refugee refuses appropriate employment or training. Prohibits such assistance to full-time students in institutions of higher education. Requires welfare agencies to notify the sponsoring agency when a refugee applies for assistance. Requires the Director to report to Congress: (1) by January 1, 1983, on the need for an aid program for refugee-concentrated areas; and (2) by September 30, 1983, on the feasibility of establishing refugee orientation centers."
