Prohibits discontinuance of compensation without written assent of the employee. Requires an insurer, where there is no such employee assent, to apply for approval of such discontinuance. Requires that the employee be given an opportunity to appear at a conference before such approval may be given. Directs the Deputy Commissioner with jurisdiction over a case to assign a case to a conference upon notice from either party to a claim that: (1) an insurer has failed to pay compensation upon filing of such claim; or (2) the parties disagree as to continuance of any weekly payments. Sets forth the Deputy Commissioner's powers to investigate and to order compensation paid, modified, or discontinued. Sets forth procedures relating to requests by aggrieved parties for hearings on such orders."
