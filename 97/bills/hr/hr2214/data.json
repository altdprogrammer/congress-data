    "text": "Wildlife Information and Learning Development Act of 1981 - Establishes a Wildlife Information Clearinghouse within the Office of Endangered Species of the Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior. Makes the Clearinghouse responsible for evaluating, consolidating, and distributing endangered species and wildlife conservation information concerning the behavioral, social, and environmental elements of wildlife existence. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for such Clearinghouse for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Fish and Wildlife Service to make grants to local educational institutions, institutions of higher education, and other public or private nonprofit organizations for the development of informational materials pertaining to: (1) species information packets for distribution to elementary and secondary schools; (2) the violation of statutes enacted for the protection of endangered or potentially threatened wildlife and plant species; (3) technical factsheets for postsecondary and graduate wildlife students; and (4) information materials which may be helpful for the general public. Authorizes the appropriation of funds for such grants for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Provides that 80 percent of such funds shall be used for projects which propose innovative and promising approaches for providing informational services to the public, five percent for the evaluation of the grant program, and the remainder to be used in a manner the Commissioner deems appropriate. Declares that none of the funds under this Act shall be transferred to any other office or agency or be subject to change by reorganization plan or otherwise, except to the extent specifically provided by law."
