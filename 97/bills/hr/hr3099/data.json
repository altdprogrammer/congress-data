    "text": "National Displacement Policy Act - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to require an applicant for a community development block grant to mitigate and end displacement of area residents. Requires the housing assistance plan to demonstrate an effective strategy for ending such displacement. Amends the United States Housing Act to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to take into consideration whether a family is, or is about to be, without housing as a result of involuntary displacement, for purposes of providing assistance under such Act. Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 to require the President to transmit to Congress, as part of the biannual Report on Urban Growth required by such Act, a special displacement component analyzing the extent of urban residential displacement and formulating a strategy to combat the adverse effects of such displacement. Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the appropriate Federal banking supervisory agency to assess a financial institution's record of adopting policies which minimize the displacement of persons from their homes. Amends the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisitions Act of 1970 to direct the payment of moving and related expenses for displaced persons whenever activities undertaken as a result of a Federal program or project cause such displacement. Declares that payments made to displaced persons shall reflect increases in the cost-of-living. Directs the President to establish a Federal Relocation Assistance Compliance Office for the purpose of carrying out a more uniform and effective administration of relocation assistance. Requires such Office to coordinate the relocation activities of the Federal agencies. States that rental or lease assistance paid to a displaced person shall not exceed 25 percent of such person's income. States that no person shall be required to move from his or her rental dwelling on account of any Federal project or any federally assisted project if: (1) the rental vacancy rate in the area for dwellings similar in size and cost is less than one percent; or (2) there is a waiting list of persons eligible to receive Federal assistance who desire to rent such unit. Directs the President, through the Federal Relocation Assistance Compliance Office, to report annually to the Congress on the extent of involuntary displacement of families and on measures to mitigate such displacement."
