Exempts from the maximum price sales provisions of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 the first sale of any natural gas produced from the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska. Waives provisions of the report to Congress on the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (September 1977) to the extent necessary to permit producers of Alaska natural gas to participate in the ownership of the Alaska pipeline segment of the approved transportation system. Requires certain antitrust consideration and findings. Waives provisions of the Natural Gas Act and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act which place certain restrictions on the importation and exportation of Alaska natural gas with respect to Canada."
