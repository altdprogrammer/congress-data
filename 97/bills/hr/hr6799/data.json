Requires the inquiry to determine the accuracy of the information. Directs the Secretary to authorize the Export-Import Bank to provide competitive U.S. sellers with matching financing if: (1) the Secretary finds the information is accurate and requests the withdrawal of the foreign financing; and (2) the foreign financing is not withdrawn within ten days of the request."
