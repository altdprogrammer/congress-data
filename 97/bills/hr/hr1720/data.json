Directs the task force to: (1) prepare an inventory of ocean sites at which radioactive wastes were dumped between 1945 and 1970; (2) make a preliminary assessment of the adverse effects of such wastes on the environment and public health; and (3) develop a comprehensive plan for continuous monitoring of such wastes in order to assess short-and long-term adverse impacts on the environment and public health. Empowers the task force to issue subpoenas for any evidence relating to any incident of ocean dumping of radioactive waste. Requires any Federal agencies which engaged in or authorized such dumping to furnish information upon written request of the task force. Requires the task force to report to Congress by October 1, 1982, on the activities required by this Act. Directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set up a preliminary monitoring program on those ocean sites at which radioactive wastes which cause significant adverse impacts on the environment and public health were dumped before 1970. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such program."
