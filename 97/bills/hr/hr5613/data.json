    "text": "Social Security Reform Act of 1982 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program under which States periodically furnish the Secretary with information on the death certificates officially filed with them so that necessary corrections may be made to the beneficiary records maintained under the social security program. Prohibits the payment of title II benefits to an incarcerated felon during any month of confinement. Treats the benefits withheld as having been paid to the felon for purposes of the payment of benefits to other persons so entitled on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of the felon. Requires the Secretary to issue a social security card at the same time a social security account number is issued. Requires that social security cards be made of banknote paper and be unable to be counterfeited. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on plans for implementing such requirements. Requires that social security cards issued to individuals who are not U.S. citizens or nationals indicate any restriction on employment of such individuals. Permits reissuance of social security cards to reflect any change in employment status at the request of such individuals or when the Secretary determines that such an individual's employment status has changed. Requires the Secretary to reissue a card to such an individual when he or she becomes a U.S. citizen or national. Requires the Secretary to issue a certification of pending issuance or reissuance in any case in which an individual or the Secretary seeks issuance or reissuance of a social security card. Prohibits the employment of an individual in the United States unless such individual has a social security card or a certification and may be lawfully employed. Requires an employer to verify the identity of an individual to whom a card or certification has been issued. Provides criminal penalties for knowingly committing violations of this Act which result in the employment of a non-U.S. citizen or national who cannot be employed lawfully in the United States. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or national and whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a resident of a foreign country who is entitled to old-age or disability benefits if such individual does not bear a spousal, filial, parental, divorced, or surviving relationship to such resident as of the date such resident reaches age 57. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of a non-U.S. citizen or national on the basis of such individual's own wages and self-employment income if such individual is not a permanent resident of the United States or has not been admitted to the United States for employment purposes. Prohibits entitlement to title II benefits in the case of an individual whose entitlement is based upon the wages and self-employment income of a non-U.S. citizen or national."
