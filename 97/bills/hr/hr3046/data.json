    "date": "1981-11-20", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #329 (379-4)) Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 (\"the Act\") to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under the definition of \"State\" for purposes of the Act, as provided in title I (Declaration of Objectives and Definitions). Revises title II of the Act (Administration on Aging) to specify that: (1) the Commissioner on Aging shall be directly responsible to the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and (2) specified functions of the Commissioner may not be delegated. Includes among the functions of the Commissioner the coordination of Federal activities with respect to the collection, preparation, and dissemination of information relevant to older individuals. Eliminates requirements that private organizations be nonprofit in order to receive specified assistance from the Commissioner to plan, develop, and operate programs under the Act. Requires consultation between the Commissioner and the head of the Federal agency administering: (1) continuing postsecondary education programs and planning under the Higher Education Act of 1965; and (2) the Adult Education Act. Eliminates the National Information and Resource Clearing House for the Aged. Sets March 31, 1982, as the deadline for a study by the Federal Council on Aging, evaluating programs for older Americans. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Council through fiscal year 1984. Eliminates outdated provisions relating to a report on legal services programs. Repeals a provision that a Congressional declaration of policy respecting \"Insular Areas\" not apply to the administration of programs for older Americans (such policy allows joint funding of certain programs in the territories). Amends title III of the Act (Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging) to remove a requirement that profit making organizations demonstrate superiority in provision of services in order to be eligible for grants and contracts under the Act. Authorizes the Commissioner to require the technical assistance and cooperation of the Department of Education in carrying out the program of grants to State and community programs on aging. Defines \"education and training service\" for purposes of such program. Extends through fiscal year 1984 the authorization of appropriations for title III grants for senior centers and supportive services and for congregate and home delivered nutrition services. Continues through fiscal year 1984 formulas for allotments to States and determination of the Federal share of the cost of title III programs. Changes from a minimum of 50 percent to \"an adequate proportion\" that portion of the amount of social service grant funds which area plans must assure will be expended for access to services, in-home services, and legal services. Requires that State plans provide that each nutrition service project will be available not only to individuals aged 60 or older and their spouses but also to handicapped or disabled individuals under 60 years of age residing in senior citizen centers where congregate nutrition services are provided. Requires that such plan give primary consideration to congregate nutrition services, but allows area agencies to award funds to organizations for home nutrition services without requiring that such organizations also provide congregate services. Permits charges for access to meals for the elderly where appropriate. Repeals a limitation on the use of nutrition services funds for supportive services. Includes education and training services among those activities to be addressed by State plans. Limits contract authority for such education and training services to the extent and amounts provided in appropriations Act. Requires that State plans assure that, if a substantial number of older individuals residing in any planning and service area are of limited English-speaking ability, the area agency on aging will be required to: (1) use outreach service delivery workers who are fluent in the language spoken by the predominant number of such individuals; and (2) designate a full-time employee whose responsibilities include: (A) making counseling available to such individuals to help them participate in programs and receive assistance under the Act; and (B) enabling social service delivery workers to take into account cultural sensitivities and linguistic differences. Prohibits States from transferring more than 20 percent of appropriated funds for any fiscal year between social services and nutrition services programs. Extends through fiscal year 1984: (1) the 30 cents per meal minimum level of assistance under the program of donation of surplus agricultural commodities to nutrition services for the elderly grant or contract recipients; and (2) the requirement that the Secretary of Agriculture purchase high protein foods, meat, and meat alternates for such purpose. Substitutes \"education and training\" for \"continuing education\" among specified allowable social services in State programs. Includes as allowable activities in such programs: (1) the installation of security devices and structural modifications or alterations of the residences of elderly individuals; (2) provision of security personnel to maintain security systems and otherwise protect such residences; (3) a Senior Opportunities and Services program to meet the specified needs of older poor persons; and (4) crime prevention services and victim assistance programs for older individuals. Revises title IV (Training, Research, and Discretionary Projects and Programs) of the Act. Eliminates provisions for: (1) appraising personnel needs in the field of aging; (2) specified grant programs for attracting qualified persons to the field of aging (but permits certain recruitment activities); (3) special demonstration projects on legal services for older Americans; (4) utility and home heating cost demonstration projects; and (5) mortgage insurance and interest grants for multipurpose senior centers. Retains provisions for grant and contract programs for: (1) training and recruiting personnel for the field of aging; (2) multidisciplinary centers of gerontology; (3) research and development projects; (4) demonstration projects; (5) special projects in comprehensive long-term care (with emphasis on alternatives to institutionalization); and (6) national impact activities. Adds provisions for grants and contracts for special projects in mental health care. Limits contract authority for both long-term care and mental health care special projects to the extent and amount provided in appropriations Act. Extends through fiscal year 1984 the authorization of appropriations for title IV. Includes the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in provisions for distribution of assistance under title IV and title V (Community Service Employment Programs for Older Americans) of the Act. Includes weatherization activities among community services for purposes of title V programs. Extends through fiscal year 1984 the authorization of appropriations for title V programs. Conforms fiscal year 1982 and 1983 authorization levels for such programs to those provided in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, including additional sums specified in the Act. Provides for forward funding of such programs. Changes the description of those to be served under title VI (Grants to Indian Tribes) of the Act from Indians 60 or more years old to \"older Indians.\" Removes the requirements that: (1) periodic evaluation of title VI activities be conducted by nonprofit private organizations selected by tribal organizations; (2) legal and ombudsman services be made available to older Indians represented by the tribal organizations receiving title VI grants (but permits such services to be offered under specified conditions); and (3) the Commissioner withhold from a State's grant allocation an amount attributable to the number of Indians to be served under grants to Indian tribes who are also counted for purposes of the State allotment. Extends through fiscal year 1984 the authorization of appropriations for title VI services (other than multipurpose senior centers). Establishes, as a new title VII of the Act, a program of Home Maintenance and Repair Services for older Americans. Authorizes the Commissioner to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, designated State agencies to provide home maintenance and repair services to older individuals. Limits contract authority for such program to the extent and amounts provided in appropriations Acts. Directs the Commissioner to administer the new title VII program so as to ensure: (1) that a preference is given to low-income older individuals; (2) coordination with older Federal programs; (3) that, to the maximum extent possible, older individuals will compose the teams of maintenance and repair specialists providing such services; and (4) sufficient information to perform simple repairs will be provided to those receiving such services. Directs the Commissioner to: (1) administer a program of housing counseling for older individuals, providing information on home energy conservation, weatherization, and crime prevention programs and techniques; and (2) annually report to the Congress concerning the housing needs of older individuals and the effectiveness of Federal programs addressing such needs. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 to carry out the new title VII program. Amends the Domestic Volunteer Services Act of 1973 to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 for National Older Americans Volunteer programs (the Retired Senior Volunteer program, the Foster Grandparent program, and the Older American Community Service programs). Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Older Americans Act of 1965. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to revise provisions for the Community Services Block Grant Act program. Includes as eligible entities for purposes of such program specified agencies and special programs in addition to designated community action agencies. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Act. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide that the priority established in favor of the United States, under specified provisions of bankruptcy law, shall not apply to indebtedness of the Student Loan Marketing Association."
