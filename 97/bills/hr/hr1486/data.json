Sets forth requirements with respect to Federal acquisition of lands within the refuge. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land subject to a life use or, at the owner's option, to an extended use reservation for a term of years in the case of any person who is the owner of land as of January 1, 1982, that is within the refuge and contains a structure suitable for residential use. Permits owners of property within the refuge to offer to sell their property to the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to purchase such properties immediately and take immediate possession of them. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring property within the refuge by eminent domain for two years after Congress has appropriated funds for acquisition of the refuge, except as may be necessary to control public access to concentrated nesting sites within the refuge. Authorizes appropriations beginning in fiscal year 1983. Requires the Secretary to transfer ownership, jurisdiction, and control over the Jones Island National Wildlife Refuge to the State of Washington for use as a public recreation area."
