Establishes a formula for determining the amount of the annual Federal payment. (Currently, the payment is based upon an amount requested by the D.C. Mayor, approved by the D.C. Council, and reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.) Authorizes appropriations for the annual Federal payment for FY 1982 and 1983. Requires a congressional review of the operation of the formula for the annual Federal payment to the District during the first session of the 100th Congress."
