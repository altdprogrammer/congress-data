    "text": "Title I: Withdrawal of Land in Black Hills National Forest for Use as Indian Religious Cultural Resource Area - Withdraws certain Federal lands in the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota from public use for a period of ten years. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a ten-year permit to the Yellow Thunder Camp community established by the Lakota-Dakota (Sioux) Nation to use such lands as a cultural and religious resource area. Prohibits any lease, permit, or contract with respect to such lands without Yellow Thunder Camp's consent. Requires that the Secretary assure that any land and resource management plan for lands in the Black Hills National Forest: (1) prohibits activities harmful to religious or cultural sites of the Lakota-Dakota Nation; (2) prohibits excavation of archeological resources on such lands without the Lakota-Dakota Nation's consent; and (3) guarantees to the Lakota-Dakota Nation and their allies and members of other Indian nations the free exercise of their religion on such lands. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to consult and negotiate with the leaders of the Lakota-Dakota Nation to resolve conflicts with respect to their religious freedom, activities harmful to their religious and cultural sites, and the excavation of archeological resources on such lands. Directs the Secretaries to report to the President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President of the Senate on such consultations and negotiations. Title II: Special Protection For Units of National Forest System with Municipal or Agricultural Watersheds: Integrated Pest Management in National Forest System - Amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations specifying guidelines for land management plans which: (1) protect the water quality and quantity of municipal and agricultural watersheds in the national forest system; and (2) provide for a program of integrated pest management for the national forest system."
