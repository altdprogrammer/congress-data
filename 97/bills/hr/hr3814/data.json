    "text": "Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Act - Revises title V (Maternal and Child Health and Crippled Children's Services) of the Social Security Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to enable each State to: (1) reduce infant mortality; (2) reduce the incidence of preventable diseases and handicapping conditions among low-income children; (3) increase the availability of prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care to low-income women; (4) increase the number of children immunized; (5) increase the number of low-income children receiving health assessments and followup diagnostic and treatment services; and (6) provide medically necessary services to handicapped children, and to enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for projects and research with respect to maternal and child health and handicapped children, grants to train personnel, and grants relating to hemophilia. Declares that the amount of such appropriations shall equal the sum of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1982 to carry out the consolidated health programs. Defines consolidated health programs to mean programs relating to: (1) maternal and child health and crippled children's services and supplemental security income for disabled children under the Social Security Act; (2) lead-based paint poisoning prevention, sudden infant death syndrome, and hemophilia under the Public Health Services Act; and (3) adolescent pregnancy of the Health Services and Centers Amendments of 1978. Authorizes appropriations for succeeding fiscal years based upon the 1982 amount. Sets forth provisions revising the formula for allotting appropriated amounts. Directs the Secretary to use 15 percent of such amount for: (1) special projects contributing to the advancement of maternal and child health or services for handicapped children; (2) research projects relating to maternal and child health services or handicapped services; and (3) the continuation of funding of grants to train personnel for health care, multistate regional resource centers, and comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic and treatment centers. Allots the remaining 85 percent of such amount among the States as block grants according to each State's share of the total fiscal year 1980 appropriations to all States under the consolidated health programs; except that any amount exceeding 1980 levels shall be apportioned on the basis of the number of low-income children in each State. Directs the Secretary to fund 50 percent of a State's expenses in carrying out title V. Prohibits a State from using grant money for: (1) cash payments to intended recipients of health services; (2) the purchase or improvement of land or any building, or the purchase of major medical equipment; or (3) satisfying any requirement for the expenditure of non-federal funds as a condition for the receipt of Federal funds. Revises the State plan requirements for receiving allotments. Requires a State, in order to receive an allotment, to: (1) transmit to the Secretary annually a description of the intended use of payments; and (2) transmit to the Secretary assurances that: (a) the State health agency will be responsible for the administration of allotted funds; (b) the State will fairly allocate allotted funds; (c) allotted funds will be used to provide services under the consolidated health programs; (d) of the funds allotted a State, no more than 15 percent will be used for program administration, no more than ten percent will be used for training and technical assistance, at least 85 percent will be used to provide health services, and a reasonable proportion will be used to carry out the purposes of this Act; (e) that if a State imposes any charges for health services assisted by the State under title V, such charges will be adjusted to reflect income and will not be imposed on low-income mothers and children; and (f) the State will identify and apply guidelines for the appropriate frequency and content of health care assessments and services. Requires each State to report to the Secretary on its activities and audit its expenditures under this Act annually. Directs the Secretary to: (1) administer this Act through a unit specializing in maternal and child health; (2) evaluate and report to Congress concerning the performance of States receiving allotments under this Act; and (3) devise another allotment formula which takes into account the number of live births, handicapped children, and low-income mothers and children in a State and the State's financial resources. Sets forth provisions: (1) establishing a criminal penalty for false statements to obtain benefits under this Act; (2) prohibiting discrimination under any program or activity funded under this Act; (3) making conforming amendments; and (4) governing the transition to the program established by this Act."
