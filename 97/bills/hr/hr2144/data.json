Sets forth requirements concerning the Secretary's authority to make expenditures from such fund for uranium production and enrichment activities. Authorizes the Secretary to request the investment of funds in excess of current needs by the Secretary of the Treasury in United States obligations. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into obligations for plant and capital activity purposes or new uranium enrichment plant construction or decreasing authorized uranium enrichment capacity without Congressional authorization. Authorizes the Secretary to issue and sell to the Secretary of the Treasury bonds and notes to assist in financing uranium production and enrichment facilities and activities. Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the operation and financial activities of the uranium enrichment fund."
