Requires that such meat food products be examined and inspected at the port of entry to determine whether or not they are adulterated. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe regulations for the disposition of adulterated foods and for the labeling of non-adulterated foods. Requires the Secretary to prescribe such assessments and fees on imported meat food products to cover examination, inspection, and labeling costs as determined necessary. Authorizes the holding of any meat food product in customs custody until the foreign plant exporting such product pays such assessments or fees. Title II: Requirement That Eating Establishments Inform Customers That Imported Meat or Meat Food Products are Served in Such Establishments - Requires any eating establishment serving imported meat to inform its customers of such fact. Sets forth penalties for any owner, employee, or agent who knowingly violates such requirement."
