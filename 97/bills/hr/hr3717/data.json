Amends the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act to: (1) define the term \"coastal State\" for the purposes of such Act; (2) authorize appropriations in the amount equal to the revenue accruing from taxes relating to sport fishing equipment and certain recreational boats and boating equipment during fiscal year 1981 and each fiscal year thereafter; (3) increase the percentage of the annual appropriation deducted for administrative expenses; (4) eliminate the notification by a State of intent to accept such apportionment funds requirements; (5) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to finance up to 75 percent of the costs of the acquisition of lands or interests therein and the construction of structures or facilities; and (6) permit each State to utilize up to ten percent of its apportionment for an aquatic resource education program. Title II: Tax on Sale of Sport Fishing Equipment and Certain Recreational Boats and Boating Equipment - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of any article of sport fishing equipment."
