Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the person or State the difference in value of exchanged lands if either party chooses public lands of less value than those taken. Requires either party to pay to the Secretary the difference in value of public lands chosen if such lands are of greater value than taken lands . Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to determine the value of affected lands. Sets forth requirements to be met by a person or State seeking such land conveyance. Deems any person or State which fails to conform to such requirements to have waived all rights to acquire public lands under this Act."
