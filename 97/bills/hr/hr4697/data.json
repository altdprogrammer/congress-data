    "text": "Nuclear Waste Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to review the Department of Energy's research and development program for high-level radioactive waste disposal and to prepare a comprehensive management plan for research, development, and demonstration activities under this Act. Requires the Secretary to identify, within one year, three geographically distributed sites in different geologic media in the continental United States and to select one site for a test and evaluation facility by January 1, 1985. Specifies design requirements for such facility. Requires that the facility be in operation by the end of fiscal year 1988. Provides that the operation of the facility shall terminate when the Secretary determines it is no longer needed. Requires the Secretary to conduct various in situ research and development activities with respect to high-level radioactive waste disposal. Prohibits the conversion of the facility into a permanent disposal facility unless the Secretary can comply with legislation authorizing high-level radioactive waste repositories. Directs the Secretary, upon authorization by Federal law, to establish waste solidification facilities which provide a waste form resistant to the release of radionuclides in a repository. Requires that the waste forms and components of such facilities be ready for placement in the demonstration facility by the end of fiscal year 1988. Requires consultation and coordination with the officials of each State in which a potential facility site is located. Directs the Secretary to prepare and transmit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive management plan for the activities under this Act. Requires submission of a description of such plan as in effect each year to Congress. States that this Act shall not be construed to authorize remedial action or commercialization activities. Authorizes appropriations."
