    "text": "Public Disclosure of Lobbying Act of 1981 - Requires any organization which expends more than $1,250 in a quarter year for the retention of persons to make lobbying communications or which employs at least one individual who spends 20 percent of his or her time on such communications to register with the Comptroller General of the United States. Requires that such registration identify the organization, the organization's lobbyists, and any person who has contributed over $2,500 to the organization or an affiliate. Directs each organization and lobbyist to maintain records necessary for filing such registration and other reports for five years. Requires each such organization to file quarterly reports with the Comptroller General concerning lobbying activities. Enumerates the contents of such reports which include, in addition to the registration information: (1) an itemized listing of each expenditure exceeding $25 made to any Federal officer or employee; (2) a listing of the primary issues for which the organization lobbied; (3) a description of lobbying solicitations made to a specified number of officials or employees; (4) a disclosure of the known business contacts between the organization and the person the organization sought to influence; and (5) a list of the names of each Federal employee and officer contacted. Specifies limitations on lobbying in areas proximate to the House and Senate Chambers. Authorizes the Comptroller General to require by subpoena written reports and witnesses necessary to implement this Act. Sets forth recordkeeping and investigative duties of the Comptroller General concerning the registrations and reports filed under this Act. Directs the Comptroller General to make such registrations and reports available to the public. Requires the Comptroller General to render written advisory opinions upon the request of any individual or organization with respect to the requirements of this Act. States that anyone who acts in good faith reliance upon such advisory opinion shall be presumed to be in compliance with this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to enforce this Act using informal methods of conference or conciliation or, if necessary, referring apparent violations to the Attorney General. Directs the Comptroller General to transmit annual reports to the President and Congress concerning activities under this Act. Declares that any regulation issued by the Comptroller General concerning the form of registrations, reports, and records, shall take effect 90 days after it is transmitted to Congress unless either House adopts a resolution disapproving it. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Repeals the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act and specified provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act. Authorizes appropriations."
