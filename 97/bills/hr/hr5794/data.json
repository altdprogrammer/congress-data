    "text": "Amends the Clayton Act to authorize any individual liable for damages in an antitrust action to claim contribution from any other person jointly liable for such damages. Requires a claim for contribution to be filed within six months after the entry of the final judgment for which contribution is sought. Prohibits claims for contribution by or from persons who have been released from liability through a settlement agreement with the plaintiff in such an action. Requires the court to reduce the claim of any person who releases any other person from liability for damages. Requires contribution shares in price-fixing actions to be based upon the relative magnitude in the affected market of each competitor's sales or purchases subject to the violation. Requires contribution shares in other cases to be based upon the relative responsibility of each person for the antitrust violation."
