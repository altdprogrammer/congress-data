Establishes additional penalties for any disclosure or false assertion which prejudices the safety of the individual identified or damages the foreign affairs functions of the United States. Authorizes the head of any such agency to apply to an appropriate United States district court for injunctive relief to prevent an anticipated violation of this Act."
