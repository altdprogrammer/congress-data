    "date": "1981-12-15", 
    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1981 - Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 to increase authorizations for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 for Interstate Highway System resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to make apportionments for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 for expenditures on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways using specified apportionment factors. Limits, to a specified sum, the total obligations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for fiscal year 1982. Makes certain exceptions to such limitation. Directs the Secretary to distribute such sum according to a specified ratio. Exempts emergency repair or reconstruction projects from such limitations. Prohibits, for the period October 1 through December 31, 1981: (1) a State from obligating more than 35 percent of its share of such sum; and (2) the total of all State obligations from exceeding 25 percent of the total amount distributed to all States. Sets forth provisions with regard to State authority over such obligations. Prohibits the Secretary from distributing amounts authorized for administrative expenses and forest highways. Amends the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 to reduce the authorization of appropriations for expediting the construction or improvement of the Interstate System, including extensions through urban areas. Limits the obligation of funds authorized by such Act (except for advance construction projects approved before enactment of this Act) to the construction necessary to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the Interstate System. Describes such minimum level of service. Directs the Secretary to include only specified costs in making the revised estimate of the cost of completing the Interstate System. Adjusts the apportionment ratio for funds for resurfacing, restoring, and rehabilitating the Interstate System. Prohibits a State from receiving less than one-half of one percent of the total apportionment for the Interstate System. Makes highway reconstruction eligible for Interstate System apportioned funds. Includes the addition of travel lanes, the acquisition of rights-of-way, and the reconstruction of interchanges and overcrossings within such highway reconstruction. Revises eligibility requirements for Interstate System resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. Makes the Federal share of such projects 90 percent. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse the State of California for 75 percent of the cost of a specified Federal-aid urban system project. Authorizes the Secretary, upon application by Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, to approve the reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, or rehabilitation of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge. Directs the Secretary, prior to approval of such project, to enter into an agreement with such States and the District for future maintenance and rehabilitation of the bridge. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund. Prohibits the Secretary from including any costs for such bridge in a revised estimate of the cost of completing the Interstate Highway System. Directs the Secretary to designate, as part of the Interstate System, certain highway segments on the Federal-aid primary system in States that have no Interstate System. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 to free the State of Maine and the Maine Turnpike Authority from all restrictions with regard to toll collections on the Maine Turnpike, subject to certain conditions. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1983 for the Prairie Creek Redwood State Park bypass highway in California. Exempts such authorized sums from State and local laws relating to apportionment of funds available for highway construction or improvement."
