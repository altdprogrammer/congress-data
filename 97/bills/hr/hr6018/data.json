    "text": "Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1983 - Title I: Procurement - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for the military functions of the Department of Defense for procurement of aircraft, missiles, naval vessels, tracked combat vehicles, torpedoes, other weapons, ammunition, and other procurement. Limits the amount of funds available for the U.S. share of the costs of acquisition by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of the airborne early warning and control system (AWACS). Prohibits the contribution of such funds until the other NATO nations and Japan increase allied expenditures for mutual defense. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for the military functions of the Department of Defense for research, development, test, and evaluation. Authorizes additional appropriations for increases in salary and benefits for civilian employees. Title III: Operation and Maintenance - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for the military functions of the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance. Authorizes additional appropriations for salaries and employee benefits for civilian employees and unbudgeted increases in fuel costs and for inflation. Title IV: Active Forces - Authorizes end strengths for active duty personnel for FY 1983. Title V: Reserve Forces - Authorizes end strengths for FY 1983 for the Selected Reserve of the Reserve components of the armed forces. Provides for the adjustment of average strength levels. Sets forth the number of Reserves serving on full-time active duty to administer, organize, recruit, instruct, or train the Reserve components. Provides for the adjustment of such numbers in the national interest. Title VI: Civilian Personnel - Establishes an end strength level for civilian personnel for the Department of Defense for FY 1983. Requires the apportionment of such personnel within the various military branches and departments. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the allocation of such personnel within 60 days. Specifies the types of civilian employees to be included in such end strength levels. Title VII: Military Training Student Loads - Establishes average military training student loads for FY 1983. Title VIII: Civil Defense - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 to carry out the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950. Prohibits the expenditure of such appropriations for population relocation in time of crisis. Title IX: General Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Defense to negotiate with other nations of NATO and Japan for increased allied exenditures for mutual defense for FY 1983 and thereafter. Prohibits the procurement of binary chemical weapons. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States and the Soviet Union should freeze the production and deployment of nuclear weapons and should pursue reductions in warheads, missiles, and other delivery systems. Directs the President to report to Congress on the effect of the current and projected levels of defense spending on the economy. Sets forth a reporting system on the unit costs of major defense systems, including reports from the program manager designated for each system to the respective Secretary as part of a quarterly selected acquisition report which is then submitted to Congress. Requires that reports: (1) break down cost information both as to to the total cost of the system thus far and the procurement unit cost at the time of the report; and (2) detail any changes of schedule or system performances. Requires the Secretary concerned to determine within seven days of the quarterly report when the total program acquisition costs or the unit costs in a fiscal year without procurement authorizations exceed 15 percent of the original projections. Requires the Secretary to then notify Congress within ten days of the initial receipt of the report of such increases. Prohibits the expenditure of additional funds 30 days after the determination of overrun. Permits the expenditure of additional funds if the Secretary concerned reports to Congress within that 30 day period on the reasons for such increases, including the identities of the program managers and contractors and future actions to be taken to control cost growth. Sets forth a similar reporting system whenever a quarterly report indicates the current procurement unit cost or total program acquisition cost in a fiscal year with procurement authorizations exceeds the original projections by more than 25 percent. Prohibits the expenditure of additional funds 60 days after a determination of overrun unless the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a certification that such system is essential, no alternatives exist, and future estimates and management will control costs. Requires the Secretary of a military department to report to Congress before beginning development of a new weapon system that is designed to replace an existing system. Directs the Secretary of each military department to review existing personnel policies concerning rotation and job reassignments and take steps to reduce the number and frequency of such reassignments. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish within the Department of Defense an Office of Family Services to establish programs to assist in meeting the needs of military family members, including relocations, spouse career counseling, and adjustment to the military life. Prohibits the Secretaries of the military departments from making gender-based distinctions in enlistment, reenlistment, promotion, or assignment unless necessary to maintain readiness."
