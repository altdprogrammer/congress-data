Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to make guaranteed interest loans to a qualified municipality to cover 40 percent of the costs of establishing a district heating or cooling system. Sets forth the requirements for loan application approval. Establishes in the U.S. Treasury a District Heating and Cooling Revolving Fund for such loans. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund for the five fiscal years following enactment of this Act. Conditions Federal assistance under this Act on disclosure to the Secretary of complete information on any district heating or cooling system. Directs the Secretary to make grants to States for studies by the States and local governments on problems related to district heating and cooling."
