    "text": "Joint Chiefs of Staff Reorganization Act of 1982 - Permits a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to submit dissenting military opinions to the Secretary of Defense and then to the President. Permits the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to provide the Secretary and, when appropriate, the President with military advice in his own right. Establishes the position of Deputy Chairman to be appointed by the President and to be a member of a different armed force from the Chairman's. Requires the Deputy Chairman to perform the duties of the Chairman when absent but prohibits the Deputy from exercising military command over the Joint Chiefs or any of the armed forces. Directs the Chairman to select the Joint Staff from a list of officers submitted by each armed force. Fixes the period of assignment to the Joint Staff at three years during peacetime, unlimited during time of war. States that such members serve at the discretion of the Secretary rather than that of the Chairman and that their tenure may be extended for an additional term. Permits up to 100 selected officers to be recalled to Joint Staff duty in less than three years. Provides each officer serving as a chief of service or as a commander of a unified or specified command with an opportunity to provide formal comments on any report or recommendation from the Joint Staff to the Joint Chiefs. Makes the Secretary responsible for the operation of the Joint Staff so as to provide unified strategic direction of the combatant forces. Establishes in the Department of Defense a Senior Strategy Advisory Board to provide the President, the Secretary, and the Joint Chiefs with advice on matters of military strategy and tactics."
