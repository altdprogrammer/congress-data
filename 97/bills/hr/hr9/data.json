    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Florida Wilderness Act of 1982 - Designates the following lands in Florida as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Bradwell Bay Wilderness Addition in the Apalachicola National Forest; (2) the Mud Swamp/New River Wilderness in the Apalachicola National Forest; (3) the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness in the Osceola National Forest; (4) the Alexander Springs Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (5) the Juniper Prairie Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (6) the Little Lake George Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; and (7) the Billies Bay Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest. Prohibits the Department of the Interior from issuing phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest until the President recommends to Congress that such leases be permitted in a specified area of the forest, based upon a national need for phosphate. Requires the President to also submit the basis for the recommendation, a statement of conditions governing the activity, and required environmental impact statements. Makes a presidential recommendation effective within 90 days after its submission to Congress, unless Congress passed a concurrent resolution disapproving it. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, to determine if specified phosphate right lease applicants have discovered valuable deposits of phosphate. Requires the Secretary, within one year of the enactment of this Act, to determine the fair market value of phosphate leases which would be issued to such lease applicants absent the leasing ban under this Act. Gives the Secretary and the phosphate right lease applicants the right to petition the U.S. Claims Court if they cannot agree on the fair market value of such leases. Requires the Secretary to extend to lease applicants and their successors and assigns, in exchange for phosphate lease applications for which valuable deposit discoveries exist, a monetary credit to be used against bonus payments or rental or royal payments made to the Government on any mineral, oil, or gas lease held by the lease applicants or their successors or assigns. Provides that the designation of the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness will not alter phosphate lease rights applicable to lands within the wilderness. Allows waivers of the time deadlines under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
