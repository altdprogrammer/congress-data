    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax, at the rate of ten dollars per barrel, on Libyan crude oil sold in the United States. Sets forth rules for the application of the tax to refined products of Libyan crude oil. Prescribes a registration requirement as a condition of liability for the tax imposed under this Act. Allows an income tax deduction for the payment of such tax. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to establish in the U.S. Treasury a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Trust Fund to be used only for the acquisition and storage of petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the general fund of the Treasury to the Trust Fund, at least quarterly, the net revenues from the tax imposed under this Act for the fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to make available to the Secretary of Energy such Trust Fund amounts as the Secretary of Energy determines are necessary for the acquisition and storage of petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Prohibits the importation of Libyan crude oil into the United States after December 31, 1982, by any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates of corporations."
