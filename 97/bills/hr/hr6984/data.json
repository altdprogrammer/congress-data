Amends title II of the Social Security Act to permit a child between the ages of 18 and 22 to receive child's insurance benefits on the basis of student status if: (1) such child is a full-time student at a postsecondary educational institution; and (2) the adjusted gross income of his or her family for the most recent taxable year is $30,000 or less. Prohibits the payment of benefits for the month of May, June, July, or August to a child who qualifies for such benefits if such child completed the twelfth grade and attained age 18 before the first day of such month. Specifies the maximum amount of such benefits."
