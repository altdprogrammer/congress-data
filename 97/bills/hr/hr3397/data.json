    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-05-01", 
    "text": "Older Worker Employment Incentives Act of 1981 - Title I: Pension Accruals for Older Workers - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the prohibition against participation in a pension plan by employees who begin employment five years or less before the normal retirement age. Prohibits suspension or reduction, solely because of age, of an employee's benefit accrual, in the case of a defined benefit plan, or of employer contributions to the employee's account, in the case of a defined contribution plan. Provides that the amendments made by this title shall apply with respect to plan years beginning after December 31, 1982. Title II: Amendments to the Social Security Act - Amends title II (Old Age, Disability and Survivors Insurance) of the Social Security Act to provide for: (1) a graduated increase in delayed retirement credit; and (2) a liberalization of the earnings test, for taxable years ending after the date of enactment of this Act. Title III: Amendments to Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to the amount of credit for new employees to provide for an income tax credit for the employment of lower-income older workers. Makes such credit applicable to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 1980, in taxable years ending after such date. Title IV: Age Discrimination in Employment - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to eliminate provisions permitting age discrimination in employment where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business. Removes the existing 70-year upper age limit to which the discrimination prohibitions apply, thus extending coverage to all individuals who are at least 40 years of age. Eliminates provisions permitting mandatory retirement at age 65 for bona fide executives or high policymakers entitled to specified benefits. Amends specified laws relating to Government organization and employees to eliminate provisions which permitted maximum-age entrance requirements for Federal employees. Eliminates provisions relating to automatic separations or mandatory separations based on a prescribed retirement age for Federal employees or employees of the government of the District of Columbia. Sets forth conforming amendments to the District of Columbia Public Education Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate a mandatory retirement at age 70 requirement for tax court judges and to permit such judges who have attained age 70 to retire at any time after serving for ten years or more. Amends specified law relating to the Federal Judicial Center to eliminate a mandatory retirement at age 70 requirement for the Director of the Center and to permit retirement at age 70 upon the request of the Director. Amends a specified law relating to the appointment and tenure of U.S. magistrates to eliminate a mandatory retirement at age 70 requirement for such magistrates. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to repeal mandatory retirement provisions for participants in the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System. Provides that specified annuities under such System commence at age 60, or at separation for participants who separate after reaching age 60.
