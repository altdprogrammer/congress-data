Authorizes a U.S. attorney to appeal a release order with or without terms or conditions of release to either the court having original jurisdiction over the offense (in any case in which another judicial officer orders release) or to the appellate court (in any case in which the court of original jurisdiction orders release). Requires a person who has appealed his conviction in a capital case to be detained unless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) such person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to another person or to property; and (2) the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact. Subjects a person who has been conditionally released and violates a condition of release to revocation of release and prosecution for contempt of court. Subjects a person who has been conditionally released and either threatens a prospective witness or juror or commits a felony to revocation of release."
