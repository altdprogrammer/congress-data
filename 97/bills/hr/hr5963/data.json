Requires the NRC to review periodically the adequacy of the insurance required under this Act. Requires that there be collected from January 1, 1983, through December 31, 1988, an annual assessment from all licensees which shall be placed in a trust fund to be used for funding the decontamination of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear powerplant. Requires the NRC to terminate or suspend the operating or construction license of any licensee which fails to pay such assessment."
