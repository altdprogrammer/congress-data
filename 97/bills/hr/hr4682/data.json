    "text": "Amends the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to extend from August 6, 1982, to August 6, 1984, the current preclearance requirements (under which jurisdictions covered through the triggering mechanism must submit proposed electoral changes to the Department of Justice). Establishes a new standard for jurisdictions to \"bail-out\" of these requirements effective August 6, 1984. Permits political subdivisions of covered States to bail-out independently of the State. Conditions a declaratory judgment for bail-out on the jurisdiction's showing that it and all its political subdivisions have met the bail-out requirements for a ten-year period prior to the filing of the suit. Includes among the requirements for bail-out that: (1) no test or device has been used to discriminate on account of race, color, or language; (2) no actions alleging voting discrimination are pending or have gone to final judgment; (3) no Federal examiner has served in the jurisdiction seeking bail-out; (4) the jurisdiction and all its subdivisions have complied with the preclearance requirements; and (5) the jurisdiction and its subdivisions have taken affirmative steps to protect voting rights. Restates the prohibition against voting discrimination to include as a violation conduct which has the effect of discrimination. Directs that the failure of a minority to be proportionately represented does not itself constitute a violation. Extends the bilingual election requirements from August 6, 1985, to August 6, 1992."
