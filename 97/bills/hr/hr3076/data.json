    "text": "Consolidated Refugee Education Assistance Act - Repeals specified provisions of the Indochina Refugee Assistance Act of 1976, the Adult Education Act, and another Act relating to educational assistance programs for refugees. Amends the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 to extend the coverage of such Act to any alien who: (1) has been admitted into the United States as a refugee; (2) has been paroled into the United States as a refugee; (3) is an applicant for asylum, or has been granted asylum in the United States; (4) has fled from the alien's country of origin and has, pursuant to an Executive order of the President, been permitted to enter and remain in the United States indefinitely for humanitarian reasons; or (5) entered the United States on or after November 1, 1979, and is in the United States with the immigration status of a Cuban-Haitian entrant (status pending). Limits such coverage to the five-year period beginning on the date the alien first entered the United States as such a refugee or otherwise acquired such status. Eliminates fiscal year restrictions for authorizations of appropriations for all programs under such Act. Directs the Secretary of Education, for purposes of determining appropriate aid reductions, to consult with the heads of other agencies providing refugee assistance concerning disbursement of funds for educational purposes under other programs and coordination of such programs with those under such Act. Eliminates fiscal year restrictions on general assistance through State agencies for local educational agencies under such Act. Extends such assistance based on the number of refugees enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools (formerly only for Cuban or Haitian refugee children). Lowers the amount of such assistance to $400 per refugee (formerly $450). Revises provisions relating to the reduction of such grants to State and local agencies, based on amounts received under other Federal assistance programs. Eliminates fiscal year restrictions on payments to States of special impact assistance for substantial increases in refugee attendance. Revises the formula for such assistance to: (1) include the number of refugees in attendance at elementary or secondary public or nonpublic schools; and (2) lower specified amounts per refugee according to length of previous enrollment. Extends such assistance according to the number of refugees enrolled (formerly only Cuban, Haitian, and Indochinese refugee children). Revises provisions relating to the reduction of such assistance, based on amounts received under other Federal aid programs. Extends coverage of adult education programs under such Act to all refugees 16 years or older (formerly only Cuban and Haitian refugee adults). Directs the Secretary to make payments to States for such programs for each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1981 (formerly only for fiscal years 1982 and 1983). Revises provisions relating to the reduction of the amount of any such grant, based on amounts received under other Federal aid programs."
