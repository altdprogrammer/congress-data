Specifies where dredged material from such projects shall be placed. Authorizes local governmental authorities to undertake such projects upon approval by the Secretary. Requires that the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate agencies, establish a project schedule for all agency decisions relating to such projects. Limits review of any final agency decision that is covered by a project schedule to the United States Court for the Central District of California. Gives such an action precedence over all other matters pending on the court's docket."
