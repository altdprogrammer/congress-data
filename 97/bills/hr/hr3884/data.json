    "date": "1981-06-11", 
    "text": "Health Service Act - Title I: Establishment and Operation of the United States Health Service - Establishes the United States Health Service as an independent agency of the executive branch. Directs the President to appoint an Interim National Health Board to govern the service during the months before a Permanent National Health Board is appointed. Requires the Interim Board to establish health care delivery regions throughout the United States, with an interim regional board for each region which shall in turn establish health care delivery districts and communities. Specifies procedures for the election of community boards by the community users and health care workers, and subsequent appointment of permanent district and regional boards, culminating, by this selection process from the bottom up, in the appointment of the permanent National Health Board from among regional users. Title II: Delivery of Health Care and Supplemental Services - Enumerates the basic health rights which the Service shall ensure in the delivery of services to users, among them: (1) the right to receive high quality health care and supplemental services without charge or discrimination; (2) the right to choose the health facilities from which to receive such services; (3) the right of access to all health information; (4) the right to an explanation of benefits and risks; (5) the right, in the event of terminal illness, to die with a maximum degree of dignity; and (3) the right to legal assistance to enforce these rights. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to entitle each employee of an employer subject to compensation for one hour of necessary health care services for every 35 hours of employment. Lists the range of services which the Health Service shall provide. Makes all individuals within the United States and its territories eligible to receive them. Requires: (1) each community board to establish community health care facilities providing certain primary and specialized services; (2) each district board to establish a general hospital; and (3) each regional board to establish a regional medical facility with highly specialized services. Specifies additional duties of regional, district, and community boards, including education on personal health matters and environmental monitoring services. Prohibits any individual employed by a health board from engaging in the private delivery of health care services. Title III: Health Labor Force - Makes the Health Service the sole judge of the qualifications of its employees, pre-empting all State or local laws to the contrary. Directs the National Health Board to issue guidelines for the classification, certification, and employment of health workers by job category. Requires each regional board to establish a health team school for the education of health workers in its region. Applies certain Federal Standards to labor-management relations within the Service, including collective-bargaining procedures and agreements. Provides for the defense of malpractice and negligence suits brought against Service employees. Title IV: Other Functions of Health Boards - Directs the National Board to establish a health rights legal service program to assist users and workers with legal problems related to health rights and health care services. Requires each regional, district, and community board to set up a health advocacy program to ensure full realization of health rights. Provides a grievance procedure for users and workers before a regional board or the National Board. Directs the National Board to oversee occupational safety and health programs at the regional level and to contribute to the development and administration of standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Requires the establishment of regional occupational safety and health programs and community safety and health action councils (OSHACs). Requires employers to provide a health facility in or near any workplace having 25 or more employees.
