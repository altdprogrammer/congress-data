Sets forth a benefits entitlement schedule. Requires claims under this Act to be filed within four years of a medical determination of brown lung disability. Requires survivors' claims to be filed within four years after enactment of this Act, or three years after the date of death, whichever is later. States that an employer shall be liable for the securing of employees benefits equal to or greater than those provided by this Act, including acquiring insurance or qualifying as a self-insurer under specified conditions. Makes an employer liable to the United States for nonpayment of benefits paid on his or her behalf by the Secretary (as required by this Act). Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for employment-related respiratory and pulmonary research. Authorizes appropriations."
