    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-208) Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 - Title I: Agriculture, Forestry, and Related Programs - Subtitle A: Food Stamp Reductions and Other Reductions in Authorization for Appropriations - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to redefine the term \"household\" for the purpose of such Act. Excludes boarders from certain food stamp eligibility requirements. Provides for an annual adjustment, beginning October 1, 1984, of the thrifty food plan. Makes the household income eligibility standard 130 percent of the nonfarm income poverty guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget, except for households with elderly or disabled members. Increases the standard deduction in computing income for eligible households and the excess shelter expense deduction for such households. Revises retrospective accounting procedures to calculate income for households that derived their income in a period shorter than a year. Prohibits a household from receiving an increased allotment as the result of a decrease in income due to a member of such household being on strike. Revises the procedures for eligibility disqualifications and claims collections. Repeals the increases in dependent care deductions for working adults and medical deductions for the elderly and disabled. Converts the food stamp program in Puerto Rico into a food assistance block grant, effective October 1, 1982. Reduces authorizations of appropriations for other specified Department of Agriculture programs for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Establishes a ceiling on the total number of employees that the Department of Agriculture may employ during the fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984, including a ceiling for overtime for such Department. Subtitle B: Reduction in Direct Spending - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set forth the procedure for the determination of the milk price support (between 75 percent and 90 percent of parity) at the beginning of each of the 1982 through 1985 marketing years. Provides for semiannual adjustments in such supports for marketing years 1983 through 1985. Makes the farm storage facility loan program discretionary after September 30, 1981. Amends the United States Grain Standards Act to require the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service to charge and collect reasonable inspection fees to cover the estimated cost of official inspection, except under certain circumstance (such costs are now shared or borne totally by the Federal Government). Prohibits the total administrative and supervisory costs for inspection and weighing, for each of the fiscal years 1982 through 1985, from exceeding 35 percent of the total costs for such activities. Authorizes appropriations as necessary for fiscal years 1981 through 1985 for other specified activities related to grain inspection. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an advisory committee to advise the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service with respect to the efficient and economical implementation of the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976. Amends the United States Cotton Standards Act, the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act, the Tobacco Inspection Act, and the United States Warehouse Act to require the collection of such fees and charges as will cover, as nearly as practicable, the costs of: (1) licensing cotton classifiers, establishing cotton standards, and making classification services available to cotton producers; (2) performing tobacco inspections; and (3) inspecting warehouses and licensing inspectors and warehousemen. Amends the Naval Stores Act with respect to the marketing of spirits of turpentine and resin to require user fees, collected from processors and warehousers, to cover the costs of establishment of standards, examinations, and related services. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to set interest rates on Farmers Home Administration loans for water and waste disposal and for community facilities as high as the current market yield for outstanding municipal obligations. Provides for up to a five percent interest rate for such projects in low-income communities. Limits the authorized insurable amount for such loans for fiscal year 1982. Requires the interest rates on non-guaranteed loans for non-farm uses of prime farmland to be two percent per annum higher than would otherwise be applicable. Establishes eligibility for emergency (disaster) loans at 30 percent production loss. Limits the basis of such loans to 80 percent of the total loss. Establishes limits for insured farm ownership and farm operating loans for fiscal year 1982. Establishes a five per cent interest rate (not less than two percent in a case of extreme financial hardship) for insured electric and telephone loans under the Rural Electrification Act, effective July 24, 1981. Requires the Federal Financing Bank to make a loan guaranteed by the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration upon the request of any borrower. Limits, for fiscal year 1982, the amount of Commodity Credit Corporation funds which can be made available for administrative expenses of such Corporation.
