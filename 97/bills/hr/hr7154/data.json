    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982 - Amends the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to provide that upon the filing of a civil complaint the clerk shall issue a summons and deliver the summons to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt service of the summons and a copy of the complaint. Provides that process, other than a subpoena or a summons and complaint, shall be served by a U.S. marshal or deputy U.S. marshal, or by a specially appointed person. Provides that a summons and complaint shall, at the request of the party seeking service or such party's attorney, be served by a U.S. marshal or deputy U.S. marshal, or by a specially appointed person only: (1) on behalf of an individual authorized to proceed in forma pauperis; (2) on behalf of the United States; or (3) pursuant to an order issued by a court stating that a U.S. marshal or deputy U.S. marshal, or specially appointed person, is required to serve the summons and complaint. Authorizes the service of a summons and complaint upon a defendant by first class mail. Provides that if service of the summons and complaint is not made within 120 days after filing the complaint and the party on whose behalf such service was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made within that period, the action shall be dismissed without prejudice upon the court's own initiative with notice to such party or upon motion. Sets forth forms for the notice and acknowledgment for service by mail. Increases the penalty for nondiplomatic foreign agents who do not submit notification to the Secretary of State prior to acting in the United States from $5,000 to $75,000."
