Treats an individual as an independent contractor if such individual: (1) controls the total number of his work hours; (2) does not maintain a principal place of business, or, if he does, such place of business is not provided, or is not provided rent-free, by the person for whom such individual performs services; (3) has substantial investment in his business and earns income based upon sale or output rather than upon number of hours worked; and (4) performs services pursuant to a written contract and is provided written notice of his responsibility with respect to income and self-employment taxes. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to exclude from social security coverage service performed by an individual who qualifies as an independent contractor under the standards established by this Act."
