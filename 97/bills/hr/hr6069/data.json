Authorizes the Comptroller General to examine the records of both committees relative to the expenditure of such amounts. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress not later than 45 days after each calendar quarter on the activities carried out under this Act during such quarter. Terminates the issuance of the coins after December 31, 1985."
