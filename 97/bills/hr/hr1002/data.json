    "text": "Wildlife on Federal Lands Trapping Act of 1979 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations relating to the trapping of mammals and birds on Federal lands. Prohibits the Secretary from approving any type of trap unless such trap utilizes the most humane capture method available for the species concerned and minimizes the probability of capturing species for which such trap was not intended. Directs the Secretary to undertake a research program to develop such types of traps. Establishes an advisory commission to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to traps. Prohibits the Secretary from permitting trapping on Federal lands where such trapping may reduce any species below specified levels. Establishes a procedure for the issuance of trapping permits. Requires the attachment of a shipping certificate to any package containing the fur, hide, skin, horn, or feathers of any mammal or bird captured by any trap within any State if such package is transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Establishes criminal penalties for specified violations. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with States with respect to the imposition of trapping regulations. Limits Federal participation, after the effective date of this Act, in engaging in State trapping programs unless such programs are designed for conserving or controlling predatory mammals and birds. Authorizes appropriations."
