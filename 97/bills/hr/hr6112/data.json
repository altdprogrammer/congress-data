Specifies that the following are to be included in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research program: (1) assessment of techniques for quantifying and defining marine environment degradation; (2) assessment of the ocean waters' ability to assimilate waste materials; and (3) development of techniques and equipment to minimize pollution from such wastes. Directs the Environmental Protection Agency to develop guidelines for integrating social and economic factors into Federal decisions regarding ocean dumping. Requires such guidelines to be reported to Congress by October 1, 1984. Directs the Agency, in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other appropriate governmental agencies and private persons, to assess the feasibility of developing regional waste disposal programs, including ocean dumping. Sets forth program factors. Authorizes appropriations of not more than $12,000,000 for each of FY 1983 and 1984 for ocean dumping research."
