    "as": "Reported to House amended",

    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service with amendment, H. Rept. 97-433) Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982 - Authorizes each executive agency and military department to establish programs to allow flexible and compressed work schedules for employees. Provides for the administration of such schedules (see all below) in nearly identical fashion as the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1978 which provided for the experimental implementation of such schedules. Requires that such a flexible schedule include: (1) designated hours and days when an employee must be at work; and (2) designated hours during which an employee may elect his or her arrival and departure times to vary his or her daily work schedule or to earn credit hours to reduce his or her workweek or another workday. Permits the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to terminate such a program upon determining that it is not in the best interest of the public, the Government, or the employees. Permits the agency head to restrict the employees' choice of arrival and departure times, restrict the use of credit hours, or exclude employees from the program upon determining that the program is disrupting agency functions. Authorizes an agency head, at an employee's request, to grant an employee on such a flexible schedule compensatory time off in lieu of payment for overtime hours. States that such an employee shall not be compensated for credit hours except as hours included in the employee's basic work requirement. Disallows such an employee to receive premium pay for night duty or night differential pay except for applicable hours during which the employee is required to work, with specified exceptions. Entitles such an employee to eight-hours pay for Federal holidays. Permits the OPM or an agency to use recording clocks in flexible schedule programs. Limits the number of credit hours an employee may carryover from one pay period to the next. Requires that a flexible schedule employee be compensated for accumulated credit hours when such schedule ends. Authorizes each agency to establish programs providing a four-day workweek or other compressed schedule. Sets forth circumstances under which an employee shall not be required to participate in such a program. Permits the OPM to terminate such a program upon determining that it is not in the best interest of the public, the Government, or the employees. Provides for the payment of premium pay to compressed schedule employees for: (1) hours worked in excess of the compressed schedule; (2) any workday a part of which is performed on Sunday; and (3) hours worked on a holiday. Declares that for purposes of provisions concerning the administration of leave and retirement for Federal employees, references to a day or workday shall be considered to be references to eight hours. Excludes employees within a unit represented exclusively by an organization of Government employees from the flexible and compressed schedule programs under this Act, except to the extent such a program is written into any bargained agreement. Prohibits any employee from interfering with another employee's rights of participation in a flexible or compressed schedule program. Directs the OPM to: (1) prescribe regulations for administering the flexible and compressed schedule programs; (2) provide assistance to agencies; and (3) review the effects of such programs on Government operations, transportation, energy consumption, public service, employment opportunities, and employee job satisfaction."
