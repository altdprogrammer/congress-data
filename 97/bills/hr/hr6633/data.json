Increases the minimum net rate of such tax. Provides that the tax credit against unemployment tax liability available to an employer shall not be reduced due to any unpaid balances in State unemployment trust funds under title XII (Advances to State Unemployment Funds) of the Social Security Act if the State makes certain repayments. Revises the rate of reduction of such tax credit for employers in certain States to which advances of unemployment funds have been made. Removes State unemployment trust funds from the computation of the Federal unified budget."
