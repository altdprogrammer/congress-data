Requires that the right of public access to the Terril Cemetery and the right of adequate access to privately owned lands within the areas designated as wilderness by this Act be protected. Prohibits the condemnation of private property pursuant to this Act without the owner's consent. States that the second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) shall not be subject to judicial review with respect to national forest system lands in Indiana. Provides that: (1) the RARE II Study of national forest system lands in Indiana shall be considered an adequate consideration of the suitability of such lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System; and (2) the Department of Agriculture shall not be required to review the wilderness option before the revision of the initial land management plans, required for such lands by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Requires that areas in Indiana reviewed in the RARE II final environmental statement and not designated as wilderness by this Act be managed for multiple uses other than wilderness. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Indiana to determine their suitability as wilderness without express congressional authorization."
