    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-01-28", 
    "text": "Trade in Services Act of 1982 - Requires that a principal U.S. negotiating objective under a specified section of the Trade Act of 1974 shall be to develop agreements which: (1) reduce barriers to U.S. service sector trade in foreign markets; (2) modify practices which distort international trade in services; and (3) develop international rules that are consistent with U.S. commercial policies and that will help ensure open international trade in services. Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to pay particular attention to the interests of the States in any negotiation concerning barriers to international trade in services. Prohibits the USTR from entering negotiations involving a service sector regulated by the States unless the USTR has developed negotiating objectives with representatives of the States. Requires the USTR to consult regularly with the States on the negotiations. Requires the USTR to inform the service sector advisory committees established by the Trade Act of 1974 of prospective trade negotiations to reduce trade barriers. Requires the USTR to develop negotiating objectives with such committees before entering the negotiations and to consult with the committees during the negotiations. Requires the USTR to consult with interested congressional committees on such negotiations. Requires the USTR to present a proposed negotiating program and an analysis of U.S. negotiating interests to such congressional committees within 45 days after enactment of this Act. Directs the USTR to coordinate U.S. policies concerning trade in services. Requires Federal agencies regulating service sector industries to notify the USTR and seek the advice of the USTR on certain pending matters relating to international trade in services. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to establish in the Department of Commerce a service industries development program. Sets forth the purposes of such program. Directs the USTR and the Secretary to advise State governments on U.S. policies on international trade in services. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to direct the USTR to determine whether: (1) services sold by a foreign supplier to the United States are government subsidized or sold at unfair prices; and (2) a competing service sector industry in the United States is injured or threatened with injury by such sales. Requires such subsidization or unfair pricing to be considered an unreasonable practice which burdens U.S. commerce, if the USTR makes a positive determination. Directs the President to take appropriate action under such Act. Sets forth the methods of filing a petition with the USTR requesting an investigation into subsidization or unfair prices. Requires the USTR to complete an investigation of subsidization or unfair pricing within six months. Permits termination or suspension of such investigations. Authorizes the President to impose duties or other import restrictions on suppliers of services in order to respond to unfair foreign trade practices. Requires the USTR, before the President imposes such duties or import restrictions, to consult with Federal and State agencies that regulate the services involved. Permits such fees or restrictions to be in any amount or of any kind determined by the President to be appropriate. Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. authorities responsible for regulating a service sector should, in developing their market access policies, consider the extent to which U.S. suppliers are accorded access to foreign markets. Requires Federal agencies regulating a service sector to make certain provisions in its regulations when considering rules that may affect foreign access to the U.S. market. Authorizes such agencies to impose such restrictions on foreign access to the U.S. market for such service sector as may be appropriate to promote fairness in international service sector trade. Authorizes appropriations."
