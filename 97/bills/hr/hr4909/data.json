    "text": "Federal Employees' Compensation Act Antifraud Amendments of 1981 - Prohibits the Secretary of Labor from reimbursing a provider of medical supplies or services to injured Federal employees upon determining that such provider: (1) knowingly has made a false statement on the application for reimbursement; (2) has been convicted or indicted for an offense connected with providing a medical service or supply; or (3) has been excluded from a State or Federal medical program. Requires that such a determination be based on specific findings of fact. Directs the Secretary to provide notice of such findings and an opportunity for a hearing to the affected provider. States that the Secretary shall not reimburse a beneficiary for expenses accumulated after the beneficiary receives such notice. Permits a provider to obtain a review of a final decision made by the Secretary after a hearing by commencing a civil action in a U.S. district court. Requires that providers of medical services and supplies be reimbursed under Federal workers' compensation provisions at the same levels as prescribed under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act unless the Secretary determines that a higher level is justified. Prohibits the payment of Federal workers' compensation to any convicted felon while incarcerated."
