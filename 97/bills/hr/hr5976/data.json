Requires the Secretary of the Interior to transmit such report every two years to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. Provides that such report shall include: (1) a description for each national park system unit of the condition of its natural and cultural resources, factors which alter or damage such resources, and ongoing and planned mitigation actions and their results; (2) a description of the systemwide efforts to address the resource protection requirements listed above; (3) a discussion of resource protection and management policies for natural and cultural park resources; (4) a description of the funds and staff to be allocated to such resource protection and management; (5) a discussion of the adequacy of administration budget requests and congressional appropriations in addressing specific mitigation measures; and (6) a description of funding needs with respect to implementing such policies and measures. Requires the National Park Service to solicit public involvement in the preparation of such report. Directs the Director to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for conduct of a study and a continuing advisory function on the protection of natural and cultural park resources. Requires a report based on such study to be submitted to the Director, the Secretary, and the relevant congressional committees. States that funding for such study and the Academy's advisory functions shall derive from funds specifically appropriated for such purpose to the National Park Service. Requires that resource management plans for each national park system unit be prepared and updated continually. Provides that general management plans for each park unit shall be based upon the park's resource management plan. Requires Federal agencies to notify the Secretary before the undertaking on areas adjacent to a park unit of any Federal project which threatens the park's natural or cultural resources. Directs the Secretary to recommend necessary changes for the proposed project within 60 days after receiving such notice. Requires the proposing Federal agency to adopt such recommendations so as to mitigate the adverse effects of the proposed project. Provides for the Secretary to cooperate with, and provide technical assistance to, governmental and other entities to protect national park system resources. Requires the superintendent of each park unit to work with governmental and other entities which influence or control lands, resources, and activities exterior to the park unit to develop a regional plan for the general area under which the activities of all entities can be undertaken in a mutually compatible way. Requires that at least one park unit for each administrative region of the national park system initiate such a regional plan as a pilot program within one year after enactment of this Act. Provides that all park units shall have such programs within two years after enactment of this Act. Requires that each park unit have on its staff a person to coordinate activities with respect to its regional plan. Requires the Director to initiate a training program for park personnel in cooperative land and resource planning. Provides that park units designated as biosphere reserves or world heritage sites shall receive priority attention and consideration for resource data gathering and monitoring, and resource protection efforts. Requires the Director to review the current land classification system for the preservation and use of lands within park units and adopt revisions necessary to assure the maximum protection of park resources, balanced with the use and appreciation of those resources by visitors. Requires the establishment of a public information program on the problems of protecting park resources and the solutions being implemented. Requires that the National Park Service be adequately staffed by personnel with knowledge and expertise in park resource protection and management. Makes scientific research subordinate to the resource protection and management needs of the park units. Requires the development of programs and guidelines for employee training programs, performance standards, qualification criteria, and career ladders in resource protection and management programs. Authorizes appropriations."
