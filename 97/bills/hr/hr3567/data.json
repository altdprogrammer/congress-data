Rept. 97-401) Export Administration Amendments Act of 1981 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to carry out such Act. Requires departments or agencies with information relevant to enforcement of such Act to furnish the appropriate department or agency with such information. Exempts census information and certain tax return information from such requirement. Increases the maximum criminal fine: (1) for violations of such Act; and (2) for failure to report that goods exported under a validated license are being used by the importing country for military or intelligence gathering purposes contrary to the license conditions. Makes such fines less for individuals than in other cases. Imposes a higher ceiling on the fine for violations involving national security controls or export controls on defense articles and services than for other violations of such Act. Requires all information regarding export controls to be made available upon request to the appropriate congressional committee and to the General Accounting Office (GAO). Prohibits such committee and the GAO from disclosing, except under specified circumstances, any such information that was submitted confidentially. Prohibits the imposition of export controls on food if it is determined such controls would cause measurable malnutrition in the countries against whom the controls are proposed, unless the President determines that the controls are necessary to protect U.S. security or that arrangements are insufficient to ensure that food will reach those most in need. States that this Act can be used as authority for a total embargo if the Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact countries take military action against Poland."
