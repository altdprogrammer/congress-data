Requires each Federal agency with a research and development budget of at least $100,000 in fiscal year 1982 or any subsequent fiscal year to conduct a small business innovation research (SBIR) program during such years. Requires each agency which conducts an SBIR program to spend annually a specified percentage of its budget in connection with such program. Directs the SBA to maintain an information program to assure small businesses the opportunity to participate in SBIR programs. Requires each such agency to identify categories of research and development controls which shall be the basis for contracts under the agency's SBIR program and promulgate regulations which provide for simplified, standardized SBIR solicitation, funding, and reporting processes. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to promulgate regulations for the general conduct of SBIR programs. Requires each agency which conducts an SBIR program to report to the SBA the number of research and development contracts over $10,000 in amount made under the SBIR program and to concerns other than small business concerns. Directs the SBA to independently monitor, and report annually to the Congressional Small Business Committees on, the Federal SBIR programs."
