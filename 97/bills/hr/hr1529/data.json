    "text": "Uniform Relocation Assistance Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to require the head of any Federal agency that administers, or provides financial assistance to a State, State agency, or individual for, a program or project which will result in the forced displacement of any person, to provide relocation benefits to such person. Increases the maximum amounts of optional fixed payments for moving expenses and dislocation benefits for displacement from dwellings, farms, and businesses. Eliminates the $15,000 limitation on the Federal payments (exceeding acquisition costs) required to replace a dwelling of a displaced person who owned and occupied such dwelling. Includes in such payments compensation for any increased real property taxes to be incurred by such person during the life of the mortgage of the replacement dwelling. Doubles the maximum payment required for replacement housing expenses for displaced tenants. Declares that the assurances required of relocation assistance advisory services concerning the availability of replacement housing shall: (1) be made prior to Federal approval of a project; (2) be based upon careful analysis of the housing needs of the persons to be displaced and the availability of housing; and (3) include plans for housing replacement by the Federal agency if comparable replacement sale or rental housing is not available. Prohibits a Federal agency from funding any project unless the responsible State, State agency, or individual assures the availabilty of appropriate replacement housing at least six months prior to displacement. Directs the President to designate an agency to establish uniform regulations governing land acquisition and relocation assistance for use by Federal agencies and recipients of Federal assistance. Authorizes such agency to conduct hearings as requested by any aggrieved person to resolve differing agency interpretations of such regulations. Directs the agency to adjust dollar figures for relocation benefits to account for inflation. Authorizes the owner of property to be acquired by the Government to require a second appraisal of the property value. Requires the head of an agency to offer to purchase property which has lost its value because of the agency's acquisition of other property so that the adversely affected owner or occupant would qualify for relocation benefits."
