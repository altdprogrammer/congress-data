Designates Commission officers and employees as Federal employees and officers (rather than as employees and officers of the United States Postal Service) for purposes of provisions governing civil service employment, excluding provisions concerning appointments, classification, and General Schedule pay rates. Removes the budget of the Commission from the control of the Postal Service. Subjects the Commission to the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921. Authorizes appropriations."
