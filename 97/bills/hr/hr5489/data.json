Requires the purchase program to be conducted so that it: (1) safeguards existing export markets for farm commodities; (2) encourages development of new export markets for U.S. farm commodities; and (3) provides exporters of farm products with firm commitments on items the Corporation will buy in order to facilitate the negotiation of commercial barter contracts. Requires strategic and critical materials purchased by the Corporation by commercial barter to be transferred to the stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. Requires petroleum products purchased by the Corporation by commercial barter to be transferred to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Directs the Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of Energy to cooperate with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Corporation in implementing the barter program. Authorizes the Corporation to promote barter agreements between persons involved in commerce which exchange approved materials produced abroad for U.S. farm commodity exports. Sets forth within the general powers of the Corporation the power to accept petroleum products produced abroad in exchange for farm commodities."
