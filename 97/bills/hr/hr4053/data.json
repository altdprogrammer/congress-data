    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #170 (408-5)) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to revise the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to lease lands containing oil shale deposits. Permits such leases to exceed 5,120 acres of land if the Secretary determines that a 5,120 acre tract does not contain deposits of sufficient thickness and grade to support an economically viable commercial-scale operation. Authorizes an increase of up to 15,360 acres after: (1) considering the reserve potential of the tract; (2) determining that such additional acreage is necessary to permit economically viable commercial scale operations; and (3) documenting the basis of the decision. Permits a lessee to acquire an additional lease when lease resources are within 15 years of being depleted. Provides that the limitation on ownership of oil shale leases shall not apply to leases issued to avoid bypass of small acreages of federal oil shale resources which could not otherwise be mined economically. Authorizes the Secretary to permit the mining, extraction, and disposal of other minerals which are intermingled with or unlikely to be economically recoverable except in conjunction with oil shale deposits. Authorizes the Secretary to lease additional lands required for oil shale recovery support operations. Includes as support operations the disposal of oil shale waste and the building of facilities connected with oil shale operations; but excludes mineral recovery from the additional lands. Requires the Secretary when determining whether or not to issue a lease or lease for additional lands to consider, among other things, the need for such lands, the environmental impact, and the public interest. Requires the Secretary to consult with the Governor of an affected State. Requires the Secretary, if issuing a lease contrary to the Governor's recommendation, to notify the Governor stating the reason. Permits a lease, at the option of the lessee, to include provisions providing for advance rental payments payable to a State to provide impact assistance to communities impacted by oil shale development."
