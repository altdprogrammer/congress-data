Provides for coverage of the following under the program: (1) routine physical checkups, not exceeding one in any two-year period; (2) routine eye care, including the dispensing of eyeglasses no more than once a year; (3) dental care, including teeth cleaning, extractions, and crowns and bridges (as authorized); (4) hearing care, including examinations and hearing aids; and (5) prescription drugs and biologicals. Directs the Secretary to provide for a program certifying hearing aids. Creates a Trust Fund from which benefits will be paid to enrolled individuals, after payment of an annual $60 deductible. States that the Fund shall consist of gifts and bequests as provided in title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Act and 100 percent of a special tax on alcohol and tobacco established under this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish such tax. Creates a Board of Trustees for the Fund and sets forth the reporting requirements. Sets forth provisions detailing the procedure for payment of claims of providers of services and the use of carriers for administration of benefits. Declares that every individual who: (1) is entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII; or (2) has attained age 65, is eligible to enroll. Sets forth provisions relating to enrollment and the enrollment period. Provides that the monthly premium shall be equal to the monthly premium under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the request of a State, to enter into an agreement with a State pursuant to which individuals receiving money payments under the following titles of the Act will be enrolled under the program: (1) individuals receiving money payments under a plan approved under title I (Old Age and Medical Assistance for the Aged) or XVI (Supplemental Security Income); or (2) individuals receiving money payments under all of the State plans approved under titles I, X (Aid to the Blind), XIV (Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled), XVI, and IV, part A (Aid to families with Dependent Children).
