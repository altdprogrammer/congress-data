Authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prescribe increases in the maximum price for any category of natural gas, but only if such increases are based upon increased production costs and are just and reasonable. Prohibits the Commission, when determining a new maximum price, from considering the costs of fuels or commodities other than and commodities actually used in producing the gas. Provides for the application of this Act to high-cost natural gas produced from a well the surface drilling of which commenced after enactment. Requires a seller to petition the Commission for any adjustment in the maximum price."
