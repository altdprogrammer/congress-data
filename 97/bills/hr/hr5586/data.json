    "text": "Pennsylvania Wilderness Act of 1982 - Designates the following lands in the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Allegheny Islands Wilderness; and (2) the Hickory Creek Wilderness. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire by exchange private oil, gas, and mineral rights within, and adjacent to, the wilderness areas designated by this Act. Authorizes appropriations to establish the values of both the nonfederally owned and federally owned oil, gas, and mineral rights to be exchanged and to carry out such acquisition. Sets forth procedural requirements for evaluating such rights. Requires the owners of oil, gas, and mineral rights not exchanged or conveyed out of such wilderness areas to submit to the Secretary for approval a plan detailing surface use during any oil, gas, or mineral exploration, development, or extraction activities. Permits the Secretary to condition approval with required measures designed to protect national forest resources. Provides that all federally owned lands within the Allegheny National Forest not designated as wilderness by the date of enactment of this Act, except for the islands in the Allegheny River between Kinzua Dam and the township of Tionesta, shall be managed for uses other than wilderness. Prohibits the Secretary from conducting any further roadless area review and evaluation of lands in the Allegheny National Forest or review of such lands to determine their suitability as wilderness without express congressional authorization. Provides that a wilderness designation under this Act shall not lead to the creation of buffer zones around the wilderness area. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Secretary manage the following lands within the Allegheny National Forest for uses other than wilderness: (1) the Cornplanter area; (2) the Allegheny Front area; and (3) the Clarion River area. Establishes the Kinzua National Recreation Area in the Allegheny National Forest. Requires the Secretary to publish a management plan for the protection and use of such area. Directs the Secretary to permit hunting and fishing within such area. Authorizes the Secretary to designate zones where, and periods when, no hunting or fishing shall be permitted."
