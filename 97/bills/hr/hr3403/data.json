Limits such agreements to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. Sets forth information to be supplied by a State, government agency, or private nonprofit entity on its application to enter into such an agreement. Grants the Secretary discretionary power to approve or deny such applications. Specifies criteria to be considered by the Secretary in making such decision. Requires that such approval or denial be granted within 60 days of the date of the application. Limits the duration of such agreements to three years. States that the cost of constructing any facilities for use as a training center shall be borne by the party to the agreement with the Secretary. Permits training of private industry personnel on a reimbursable basis. Allows the Secretary to enter into a contract with a private entity for use of a supplemental reporting system and data center operated and maintained by such entity. Authorizes appropriations, with specified limitations, for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary, within 365 days after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the feasibility of a prenotification system that would inform State or local governments in advance of the timing, nature, and routing of hazardous materials shipments through their jurisdictions. Specifies groups and organizations to be consulted in preparing such report. Directs the Secretary to develop a methodology for analyzing the comparative risks and costs associated with transporting radioactive materials by highway, railroad, barge, or vessel from a place where such materials are generated to a storage or reprocessing facility."
