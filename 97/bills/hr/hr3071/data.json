Limits the authority of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish noise emission standards. Provides that such Federal regulations shall apply only to transportation equipment and to motors or engines designed for use in transportation equipment. Repeals provisions for: (1) EPA noise control regulations pertaining to product labeling; and (2) prohibitions relating to such regulations. Authorizes States to bring civil actions in U.S. district courts to impose penalties against violators of prohibitions under such Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983."
