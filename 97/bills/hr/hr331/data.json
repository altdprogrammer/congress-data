Requires such zero-base budgeting process to consider alternatives to the program, the costs and benefits, the necessity, and the effectiveness of such program. Prohibits the extension of budget authority for any such program beyond such six-year period until the Congressional committees with jurisdiction over such programs conduct such periodic reviews."
