    "date": "1981-04-07", 
    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Extends the scope of such offense to include using or carrying any deadly or dangerous weapon (current law is limited to firearms). Redefines such offense as using such a weapon to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction or carrying a weapon during such a felony involving violence. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally\". Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to one to five years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years), five to ten years for a second offense (currently, two to 25 years for a second or subsequent offense), and life imprisonment for a third offense. Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Prohibits the granting of parole to any offender. Expresses the sense of Congress that the executive prosecute vigorously such offenses."
