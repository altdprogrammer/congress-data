    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-12-15", 
    "text": "Tuition Tax Relief Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow certain taxpayers a refundable income tax credit for 50 percent of the expenses paid for the elementary or secondary education of the taxpayer's child. Allows such credit only in the case of a taxpayer who is: (1) an unmarried individual with a taxable income of $40,000 or less; (2) a married couple filing jointly with a taxable income of $40,000 or less; or (3) a married individual with a taxable income of $20,000 or less. Limits the amount of such credit to $500 in the case of expenses incurred after July 31, 1982, and before August 1, 1983, and $1,000 in the case of expenses incurred after July 31, 1983. Excludes from the definition of \"expenses of elementary and secondary education\" any amounts paid for books, supplies, meals, lodging, transportation, similar personal expenses, and for education below the first-grade level or attendance at a kindergarten or nursery. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school except to the extent necessary to determine whether such school is an eligible educational institution for purposes of the tax credit. Requires that any amount received by the taxpayer as a tuition tax credit be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of the taxpayer for Federal, State, or local educational assistance. Specifies that the granting of a tax credit to a student due to his enrollment in any educational institution shall not be considered as Federal assistance to such institution."
