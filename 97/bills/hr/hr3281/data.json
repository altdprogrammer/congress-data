    "text": "Youth Skills Act of 1981 - Declares the intention of the Congress to establish the authority of Opportunities Industrialization Centers and other community-based organizations of demonstrated effectiveness to develop and furnish skills training and job placement as subgrantees in unrestricted grant programs. Directs the head of each agency administering specified programs to take necessary actions to ensure that: (1) appropriate youth employment and training services will be furnished under each such program; and (2) Opportunities Industrialization Centers and other community based organizations will be given special consideration in the delivery of such services. Specifies the programs to which such requirement applies as: (1) the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 and any successor program providing for general revenue sharing to States and/or local government; (2) title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, or any similar legislation providing unrestricted grants for community development; (3) any program providing for unrestricted Federal assistance for public works or for the creation of private sector jobs; (4) any program to rehabilitate and improve U.S. railroads; and (5) any program of tax incentives or other Federal subsidies to encourage economic development of urban areas with high concentrations of unemployed individuals, especially areas designated as urban enterprise zones. Directs such agency heads to assure that eligible employers under such unrestricted financial assistance programs will enter into contracts for the delivery of employment and training services to youth. Directs the Secretary of Labor to advise appropriate public agencies and private contractors receiving assistance under such programs of the provisions of this Act and the availability of subcontracting the delivery of employment and training services for youth to Opportunities Industrialization Centers and other Community based organizations. Directs such agency heads to assure that recipients of financial assistance under such programs provide employment and training services, with special consideration for jobs with prospects of continued employment, for youth: (1) hard to employ and historically unemployed and unskilled; (2) living in urban and rural areas with high concentrations of welfare families ; (3) living in designated enterprise zones; and (4) living in rural areas where job opportunity development will prevent out-migration to urban areas. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions. Defines \"community based organization\" as a nonprofit tax exempt organization of demonstrated effectiveness in delivering employment services. Cites examples of such organizations. Defines \"Youth\" as an individual who has attained 18 years of age but not 26 years of age. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as a limitation on any other Federal law provision for employment and training services."
