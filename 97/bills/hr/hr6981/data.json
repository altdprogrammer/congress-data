    "text": "Federal Firearms-Owner Protection Act of 1982 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require that violations of firearms registration laws be willful before a firearms license can be revoked. Terminates the application of firearms licensing requirements to \"collectors.\" Prohibits licensed importers, manufacturers, dealers, and collectors from receiving a firearm from another State, if the State where they reside would prohibit it. Applies the confiscation and forfeiture provisions of the Federal firearms law only to firearms and ammunition actually involved in or used in violations of such law. Terminates application to firearms and ammunition merely intended to be used, but not actually used. Authorizes the court to award the defendant reasonable attorneys' fees if the defendant is not convicted. Provides for legislative veto by a simple resolution adopted by either House of Congress of any proposed rules and regulations under this section. Increases the term of prison sentences for violations of this section."
