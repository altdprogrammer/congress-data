    "text": "Title I: Federal Aid Highway Act of 1981 - Amends the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 to increase the authorization of appropriations for the Interstate Highway System for fiscal years 1983 through 1990. Limits the obligation of such funds to specified objectives. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in making the revised estimate of the cost by completing the then designated Interstate System, to include only those costs eligible under such Act, as amended. Authorizes the Secretary to assess the status of all incomplete segments of the Interstate System and to withdraw approval of any routes as appropriate. Directs the Secretary to use specified apportionment factors in allocating funds for the Interstate System. Authorizes appropriations, for fiscal years 1982 through 1986, out of the Highway Trust Fund for: (1) the Federal aid primary system in rural and urban areas; (2) forest highways; (3) public lands highways; (4) bridge replacement and rehabilitation; and (5) resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing (through fiscal year 1987) certain nontoll portions of the Interstate System. Directs that the unobligated balance of contract authority established by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1978 for the Great River Road and highway safety programs shall lapse September 30, 1981. Revises apportionments for the highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program. Makes highway reconstruction eligible for Interstate System apportioned funds.

Allows the Secretary to discharge any responsibilities under such Act relative to the physical construction phase of Interstate resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction projects by using certain certification procedures. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for the inspection of construction and repair projects (currently directs the Secretary to make a final inspection). Amends such Act and the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 to delete the prohibition on the use of land from a historic site of national, State, or local significance for transportation projects. Authorizes the Secretary, upon application of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, to approve reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge. Sets forth funding criteria for such project and limits the Federal share to 75 percent of the project cost. Directs that the parties shall agree, as a condition precedent to such reconstruction and rehabilitation, to convey the respective portions of the Bridge to Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia without monetary consideration. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this Act in cooperation with Federal and State agencies and foreign countries without regard to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Repeals the territorial highway program. Repeals the provisions of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 dealing with the acceleration of bridge projects. Authorizes the Secretary to approve, for Federal financial assistance, projects for use as preferential parking for carpools. Sets forth criteria for the operation and management of such parking facilities. Amends the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 to allow limited truck traffic on the Highland Scenic Highway. States that such commercial use by trucks may be limited and controlled by permit. Limits funds for research and planning to specified amounts. Specifies the Federal share of such funding pursuant to certain criteria. Transfers to the Secretary the functions, powers, and duties of the Appalachian Regional Commission related to the Appalachian Development Highway.

Increases the Federal share for such Highway system. Title II: Highway Safety Act of 1981 - Amends the Highway Safety Act of 1966 to authorize appropriations, out of the Highway Trust Fund, for fiscal years 1982 through 1986 for highway safety programs and highway safety research and development.

Repeals provisions relating to: (1) school bus driver training; and (2) innovative project grants.
