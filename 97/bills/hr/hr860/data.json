Designates specified segments of the following rivers for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system: (1) Myakka, Florida; (2) Saint Lucie, Florida; (3) Salmon, Connecticut; (4) Farmington, Connecticut; (5) Parker, Massachusetts; (6) Caney Fork, Tennessee; (7) Dan, North Carolina and Virginia; (8) Satilla River, Georgia; (9) Cimarron, Kansas; (10) Hoh, Washington; (11) Dosewallips, Washington; (12) Quillayute, Washington; (13) Wood, Rhode Island; (14) Black, Wisconsin; and (15) Humptulips, Washington. Requires the study of the Farmington River, Connecticut, to include an analysis of whether low-head hydroelectric generating facilities can be installed on such river at existing dams without having a direct and adverse effect upon the fish, wildlife, recreational, and aesthetic values of the river. Requires that the study of the Salmon River and the Farmington River in Connecticut and the Hoh River, the Humptulips River, and the Quillayute River in Washington include an analysis of the various means of maintaining and enhancing the fisheries resources of such rivers. Declares that during the study of the Myakka River, Florida, no permits or licenses currently approved for mining and related activities shall be affected. Designates specified segments of the following rivers as components of the national wild and scenic rivers system: (1) the North Umpqua and the Illinois Rivers both in Oregon; and (2) the Dosewallips River in Washington. Requires the agency charged with the administration of each designated component of the national wild and scenic rivers system to establish detailed boundaries therefor and determine which class outlined in such Act best fits the river or its various segments, within one year from the date of designation of such component (formerly within one year from the date of such Act). Eliminates the requirement that such an agency prepare a plan for the necessary developments in connection with the administration of such a river. Requires an agency charged with the administration of each such component, within specified time periods, to prepare a comprehensive protection and management plan to guide the agency's administration in accordance with the classification made under such Act. Requires that such plan: (1) include the identification of, and plans for implementation of, user carrying capacities for all types of public use activities within the boundaries of the river; and (2) be prepared after consultation with State and local governments and the interested public. Limits authority to enter into contractual agreements and to make payments under this Act pursuant to such contractual agreements. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
