Appropriates to the Trust Fund amounts received in the Treasury equivalent to any windfall profit taxes imposed on domestic crude oil production.

Requires that the amounts in the Trust Fund be used only for the payment, purchase, or redemption of any obligations included in the public debt. Directs that all such obligations be canceled and retired and not be reissued. Repeals provisions of the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 which establish the Windfall Profit Tax Account in the Treasury and direct the allocation of amounts deposited therein."
