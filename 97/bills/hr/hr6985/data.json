Sets forth application requirements for grant eligibility and for such centers. Requires such centers to: (1) provide certain services; and (2) in providing services, to give priority treatment to certain older persons. Limits any such grant to $400,000 for any fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to operate a national clearinghouse for information on such centers. Permits any business or labor organization, public agency, or nonprofit or profitmaking organization, as well as a State, State or local educational agency, educational institution, postsecondary educational institution, or private vocational training institution, to be an eligible recipient of such a grant. Defines \"older person\" as an individual 55 years of age or older. Authorizes appropriations for such model grant program for FY 1984 through 1986. Amends the Vocational Education Act of 1965 to add to the purposes of such Act: (1) the overcoming of age discrimination and age stereotyping in vocational education programs; (2) the furnishing of equal educational opportunity in such programs to persons of all ages; and (3) the provision of part-time employment to older persons who need the earnings to continue full-time vocational training. Requires State vocational education programs to assign personnel to review such programs for: (1) assurance that grant distribution addresses older persons' needs; (2) age bias in such programs; (3) age discrimination in program hiring, firing, or promotion; (4) recommendations for overcoming age stereotyping and bias in such programs; and (5) assisting interested parties in improving vocational educational opportunities for older persons. Requires that State advisory councils on vocational education include older persons with employment and training program experience, including older persons who are minority group members. Requires that the State five-year plans for vocational education set forth: (1) the uses which the State intends to make of Federal vocational education assistance to meet the special needs of older persons; and (2) policies and procedures to assure equal access to vocational education programs by older persons."
