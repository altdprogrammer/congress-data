Permits any person who is financially responsible and who has made a bona fide offer to acquire such rail line, and whose offer has been rejected by that carrier, to submit an application to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) seeking approval of acquisition of such carrier. Requires that a copy of such application be filed simultaneously with the appropriate bankruptcy court. Sets forth rules of procedure for the Commission upon receipt of such application. Requires any person acquiring a rail line under this provision to use, to the maximum extent practicable, employees or former employees of the carrier in the operation of service. Prohibits such person from transferring or discontinuing service within four years of such acquisition. Amends the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act to direct the ICC to order directed service for three years (currently two years) over any railroad in operation on March 1, 1980, which is subject to Federal bankruptcy laws and which has ceased to provide passenger commuter service. Empowers the Commission to authorize temporary operations over any rail carrier subject to a liquidation until the disposition of the properties of the estate of such carrier. Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to direct the Secretary to guarantee an obligaton of any railroad in reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy laws for purposes of funding any agreement between such railroads and their employees which provides for the protection of employees adversely affected by reduction in service or restructuring transactions. Sets forth the maximum amount of such guarantees.

Sets forth procedures and limitations for employees who elect to receive assistance under this title. Provides that such obligation guarantees shall be treated as administrative expenses of the estate of the bankrupt carrier. Limits the total liability of a bankrupt carrier to the amount guaranteed by the Secretary. Declares that prerequisites, general requirements, and employee protection provisions of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 shall not apply to such guaranteed obligations.

Title IV: Continuance of Preference Share Program - Amends the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 to extend the preference share program until September 30, 1985. Requires the Secretary to purchase a specified amount of redeemable preference shares as necessary for the purchase, lease, or rehabilitation of properties of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) by non-carrier entities to be used for common carrier rail service, provided an application for a certificate of abandonment or notice of insufficient revenues has been filed with the ICC with respect to such rail service. Requires the Secretary to make certain that all indebtedness under this title is likely to be repaid or can be secured. Directs the Secretary to purchase a specified amount of shares for the rehabilitation of the rail properties of the Delaware River Port Authority, upon application by the Authority.

Reserves to the Alaska Railroad the right to use and occupy, without compensation, the surface of the lands on the right-of-way of the Railroad within the Denali National Park and Preserve for terminal and other existing facilities. Subjects the use of such lands to laws and regulations regarding the protection of resources of the national park system. Reserves to the Secretary of the Interior: (1) existing and future rights-of-way and easements for park administration, transportation, and utility purposes; and (2) the right to use and occupy without compensation the McKinley Park Station for national park administrative purposes. Prohibits such reservations from unreasonably interfering with railroad operation and support functions. Reserves to the Alaska Railroad, subject to reasonable stipulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, the right to use and occupy, without compensation, the surface of the lands within that portion of the right-of-way of the Railroad located within any national forests for terminal and other railroad facilities.
