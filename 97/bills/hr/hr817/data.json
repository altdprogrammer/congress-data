    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that public utilities which utilize for ratemaking purposes a procedure or adjustment which is inconsistent with methods used in estimating or projecting tax expenses, depreciation expenses, or reserves for deferred taxes shall not be considered to have complied with the normalization method of accounting required for computing the accelerated depreciation and investment tax credit amounts of such utilities. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations which define other procedures and adjustments which are inconsistent with the normalization method of accounting. Provides that violations of normalization requirements shall not result in a public utility's loss of eligibility for accelerated depreciation or the investment tax credit if: (1) such violations involved the use of estimates, projections, or adjustments to the utility's rate of return; and (2) such estimates, adjustments, or projections only applied for periods ending prior to March 1, 1980, and were included in certain specified orders of a public utility commission. Delays the payment of any tax refunds or credits for overpayments resulting from the amendments made by this Act until after October 1, 1981."
