Directs the Secretary to begin an inquiry within five days after receipt of information that foreign sales to the United States are being seriously offered involving foreign official export credits that violate international agreements. Requires the inquiry to be completed within 30 days. Directs the Secretary to authorize the Export-Import Bank to provide competitive U.S. sellers with matching financing if: (1) the Secretary finds the information is accurate and requests the withdrawal of the foreign financing; (2) the foreign financing is not withdrawn within ten days of the request; and (3) the Secretary determines that the availability of such foreign official financing is likely to be one of the relevant factors in the sale or sales. (Current law authorizes the Secretary to offer such financing if the financing is likely to be a determining factor in the sale.)"
