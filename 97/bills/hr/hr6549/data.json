Establishes an Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health to coordinate Federal and private activities. Requires the Committee to meet at least four times a year. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress. Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to change existing label warning provisions to require cigarette packages and advertisements to carry specified health warnings. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, or package cigarettes for sale or distribution in the United States without package disclosure of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels (based on Federal Trade Commission tests). Requires the Commission to perform these tests at least once a year. Increases the fine for Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act violations from $10,000 to $100,000."
