Defines the term \"nominal consignee\". Prohibits a carrier from certifying that a person is the owner, consignee, or agent of the owner or consignee of the carrier's merchandise unless the carrier knows or has reason to believe that it is true. Permits appointment of an unpaid agent to transact customhouse business if the business involves noncommercial imports. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to exempt time-sensitive correspondence from tariffs."
