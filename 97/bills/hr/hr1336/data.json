Permits interested persons proposing to form such a commission to apply for such funding. Sets forth the required contents of the application and the criteria for approving a commission to receive funds. Requires a commission to have sufficient representation of all persons significantly affected by the area of regulation concerned. Directs each commission receiving such funding to submit to the Chairman annual reports on its activities and a final report containing its recommendations for regulatory policy. Directs the Chairman to transmit the recommendations to all agencies concerned with such area of regulatory policy for their consideration and comments. Requires any agency, when requested by a commission, to send observers to commission meetings to provide requested information. Directs the Chairman to report to Congress by January 1, 1983, on the results of commissions funded under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Exempts such commissions from provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Federal Advisory Committee Act."
