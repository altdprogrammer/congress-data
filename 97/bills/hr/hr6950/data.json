Requires such programs to emphasize on-the-job training intermixed with technical occupational training and to place recruiting emphasis on the underemployed and unemployed. Requires the participating colleges to establish an associate degree training program in designated fields according to the Director's guidelines. Requires the Director to: (1) determine the necessary fields; (2) identify economic areas with high-technology industries; (3) select accredited community colleges; and (4) appoint a National Advisory Council on High-Technology Technician Training to advise him on the program. Requires the Director to report to Congress annually on the program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 and 1985."
