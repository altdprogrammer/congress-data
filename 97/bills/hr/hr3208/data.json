Authorizes the Secretary, in the interests of dam safety, to make operational modifications or to remove a dam entirely. Includes within the scope of the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978: (1) Fish Lake, Four Mile, Ochoco, Savage Rapids Diversion and Warm Springs Dams, Oregon; (2) Como Dam, Montana; (3) Little Wood River Dam, Idaho; and (4) Twin Buttes Dam, Texas.
