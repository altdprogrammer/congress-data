    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 97-492 (Part I)) Title I: Transfer of Small Parcels - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to convey certain National Forest System (System) lands which cannot be practicably conveyed under any other authority of the Secretary and: (1) whose individual value is not more than $150,000; (2) are 40 acres or less and interspersed with or adjacent to lands already transferred out of Federal ownership under mining laws; (3) are five acres or less and have been innocently encroached upon due to an erroneous survey or other land description; or (4) are road rights-of-way no longer needed by the Government. Directs the Secretary to: (1) insert in any such conveyance reservations necessary to protect the public interest and to provide for public access to System lands; and (2) accept consideration equal to the value of the conveyed land. States that any person receiving: (1) such land shall pay the associated conveyance costs; or (2) a road right-of-way shall reimburse the Government for improvements. Permits the Secretary to waive these provisions. States that: (1) conveyances of road rights-of-way shall be used or maintained according to State or local laws; and (2) nothing in this title authorizes conveyances of public lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National System of Trails, and any national recreation area. Title II: Exchange of Certain National Forest and Other Lands - Amends Federal law to permit State, county, and local governmental bodies to participate in System land exchanges (currently limited to public school authorities). Limits the land parcels in such governmental exchanges to 40 acres in size or $150,000 in value (unless the exchange is with a public school authority, in which case the limit is 80 acres). Provides that any such land that ceases to be used for public purposes within 15 years of the conveyance shall revert to the United States. Permits non-public use of the land after 15 years with notice to the Secretary and the appropriate congressional committees, unless any of such committees vetoes such use by adopting a resolution of disapproval. Title III: Congressional Review of Land Exchanges - Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate congressional committees of any proposed sale or exchange of System land whose value exceeds $150,000. Authorizes the Secretary to complete such conveyance upon: (1) the expiration of 30 days after notice to the committees, unless any of the committees disapproves before the 30-day period ends; or (2) such earlier date as the committees may approve. Title IV: Small Sales - Authorizes the Secretary to sell individual or small numbers of dead or damaged trees on System land if: (1) the sale is for less than $10,000; (2) the sale's value is at least equal to its costs; and (3) the sale is consistent with multiple use management. States that such sales shall be made pursuant to negotiations with interested persons, rather than through advertising or competitive bidding. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a special small salvage fund to collect and use the proceeds of these sales; and (2) transfer moneys in excess of $1,000,000 from such fund to the Treasury. Makes the provisions of this title effective October 1, 1982."
