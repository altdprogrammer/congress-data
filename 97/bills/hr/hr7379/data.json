    "text": "Natural Gas Import Policy Act of 1982 - Prohibits the importation of natural gas into the United States from a foreign country unless: (1) a new price for natural gas imported to the United States has been established by the government of such foreign country (or, if no such price is established by such government, by the producer or exporter of such natural gas); (2) such price has been agreed to by the Secretary of Energy on behalf of the United States; and (3) the contract or contracts applicable to such importation have been renegotiated to conform to such new price and tariff adjustments to reflect the cost savings achieved by the renegotiation and have been filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the importer. Provides that in the case of any terminal or attendant facility located in the United States and constructed for the importation of Algerian natural gas (the authority for which is supended by this Act), FERC shall permit recovery of the costs prudently incurred in connection with the construction of such facility to the same extent and in the same manner as if such facility were used and useful for the importation and transportation of natural gas (without regard to the suspension under this Act of importation authority). Prohibits FERC from permitting any rate of return on such costs. Includes \"liquefied natural gas\" within the term \"natural gas\" for purposes of this Act."
