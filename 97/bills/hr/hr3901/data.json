Directs that rates of compensation paid for such transportation shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of a specified local service class subsidy rate. Alters the date after which an air carrier may file an application with the Board to have such compensation terminated. Directs the Board and the Secretary of Transportation, by January 1, 1982, to report to Congress on the possibility of limiting subsidy payments for small community air service."
