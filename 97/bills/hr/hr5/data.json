Requires the organization and its retainees to keep adequate records of information necessary for such reports. Exempts certain tax-exempt organizations from such reporting requirement. Specifies duties of the Clerk concerning the management of information disclosed by such registrations or reports. Directs the Clerk to make copies of each registration and report available to the public. Provides for the enforcement of provisions of this Act by the Attorney General. Authorizes the Attorney General to issue a civil investigative demand requiring a person suspected of violating this Act to produce specific documentary material.
