Reduces in two stages (in 1983 and 1985) the maximum hours which an employee must work in order to qualify for overtime pay so that by 1985 an employee shall be entitled to overtime pay for a workweek in excess of 35 hours. Decreases the number of hours which certain employees who are excepted from the present 40 per week maximum hour rule must work in order to qualify for overtime pay. Prohibits any employer from knowingly permitting an employee to work overtime without the employee's consent. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promulgate exceptions to such prohibition for emergency situations in which the production in an establishment would be severely jeopardized if no exception existed. Specifies a formula for determining liquidated damages for violations of such prohibition."
