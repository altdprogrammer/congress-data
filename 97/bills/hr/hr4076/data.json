    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to two to ten years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and to five to 25 years' imprisonment for a second or subsequent offense (currently, two to 25 years). Deletes the current requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Prohibits the granting of parole to an offender for at least two years for a first offense and five years for a second offense, unless the court finds the existence of specified mitigating factors."
