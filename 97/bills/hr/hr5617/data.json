    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #187 (348-25)) Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for FY 1983 and 1984 for: (1) operation and maintenance expenses; (2) acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement of aids to navigation, shore facilities, vessels, and aircraft; (3) research, development, testing, and evaluation; (4) alteration or removal of bridges over navigable waters constituting obstructions to navigation; and (5) retired pay under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection and Survivor Benefits Plans and for payments for medical care of retired personnel and their dependents under the Dependents' Medical Care Act. Permits the Coast Guard an end-year strength of 41,500 active duty personnel. Authorizes average military training student loads. Revises the authority of the Coast Guard to establish and operate aids to maritime navigation on the inland waterways by contract with persons or public bodies or instrumentalities. Recommends that such services be provided by civilian rather than military members of the Guard. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to report to Congress within a year on the exercise of such contracting authority and on increased civilian participation. Eliminates the Secretary's annual report to Congress concerning the utilization of authority to lease housing facilities for military personnel and their dependents. Amends the General Bridge Act of 1946 and other Acts to exclude from specified bridge construction and operation provisions bridges over waters not subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and not used in interstate or foreign commerce. Eliminates the misdemeanor of unreasonable delay in opening a drawbridge. Requires that violations of regulations for bridges over navigable waters be willful to be punishable. Prohibits a vessel owner or operator from signaling a drawbridge to open for any nonstructural vessel appurtenance which is not essential to navigation. Establishes a civil penalty for violations of specified bridge regulations and orders of the Army Chief of Engineers. Requires the owner or operator of a bridge or causeway to keep it in proper repair so that it does not obstruct or make navigation hazardous. Requires that complete files of vessel inspections or examinations delegated to the American Bureau of Shipping or a similar agent be kept in the United States and accessible by the Coast Guard. Revises personnel and manning standards for foreign vessels. Increases the amount of penalties under the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971. Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to review policies and procedures for towing and salvaging disabled vessels to minimize competiton with private enterprise. Establishes an end strength level for full-time civilian employees for FY 1983 and 1984. States that a vice admiral's place on the active duty promotion list, grade, rank, pay, and allowances shall not be disturbed by the termination of an appointment for reappointment to another position as vice admiral. Repeals the requirement that the Coast Guard discharge upon petition any person under 21 who enlisted without parental consent. Permits the Commandant of the Coast Guard to provide medical and dental care to entitled personnel. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Transportation submit to Congress annually a report on special pay given to Coast Guard officers holding positions of unusual responsibility of a critical nature. Increases the authorization for operating expenses for FY 1982. Amends the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 to direct the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to publish at least annually a solicitation of nominations for membership on the Federal Boat Safety Advisory Council. Authorizes the Council to make available to Congress any information or recommendations which the Council is authorized to give the Secretary. Makes specified alterations in the compensation paid to Council members. Amends other specified Acts, including the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980, to make the same changes in the provisions affecting a Coast Guard Academy Advisory Council, the Rules of the Road Advisory Council, and the Towing Safety Advisory Committee. Requires the Coast Guard to investigate specifically factors leading to loss of life as part of its investigations of marine casualties involving loss of life. Directs the Coast Guard to notify the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee in advance of any hearing concerning a major marine accident where there has been a loss of life and to provide such Committees with any requested marine casualty information. Amends the Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Act of 1980 to enable the Committee on Appropriations to appropriate funds from the boating trust fund without resulting in a corresponding reduction in overall Department of Transportation budget authority. Converts the existing grant authority to contract spending authority effective in FY 1983 for reviewing state boating safety programs. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President and the Coast Guard should give the search and rescue operations of the Coast Guard a high priority."
