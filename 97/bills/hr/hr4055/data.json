    "text": "Floral Research and Consumer Information Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue research and promotion orders applicable to persons engaged in the production, sale, importation, or handling of flowers and plants. Prescribes administrative procedures for the issuance of such orders. Requires the Secretary, for the purpose of administering each order, to appoint a \"Floraboard\" composed of not more than 75 producers and importers nominated by certified organizations. Requires such Floraboards to develop plans and projects subject to the Secretary's approval. Provides for assessments on the sale of flowers and plants to defray administrative costs. Describes the permissive terms an order may contain. Conditions the effectiveness of any order upon its approval by a supermajority of producers voting in a referendum. Requires the Secretary to suspend or terminate an order on his own initiative, or at the behest of a referendum, under certain circumstances. Exempts certain producers and importers from coverage by such orders. Provides for refund of assessments and review of orders upon petition. Vests the district courts of the United States with jurisdiction to enforce such orders. Prescribes civil penalties for their violation. Sets forth criteria for the certification of organizations claiming to represent producers and importers. Enumerates investigative and legal powers of the Secretary with respect to Floraboard orders. Authorizes appropriations."
