Permits consumer agencies to provide information to persons for use in connection with the rental of residential property. Prohibits an agency from reporting on involvement by the consumer in any tenants organization or on any action involving a property owner and tenant, unless the owner has been adjudicated the prevailing party and judicial review is completed or barred within one year of the report. Requires consumer agencies to notify a consumer at least three days before furnishing information related to the rental of residential property. Requires users of consumer reports to disclose to consumers the identity of sources of information upon which \"adverse rental actions\" have been based."
