Limits the amount of such credit to the lesser of $2,500 or the compensation includible in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year. Specifies that no credit may be allowed for such contributions made to the account of any individual who has reached age 59 1/2. Permits certain limited amounts of employer contributions to a simplified employee pension plan to qualify for the credit. Limits the amount of such credit for an individual who has paid any designated voluntary employee contributions to the lesser of $2,500 or the compensation includible in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year reduced by the amount of such designated voluntary employee contributions. Provides for adjustment to the limitations on such credit to reflect inflation. Increases the amount of the income tax deduction for contributions to an individual retirement account to the lesser of $2,500 or the compensation which is includible in the taxpayer's gross income. Requires an individual to be between the ages of 59 1/2 and 70 1/2 in order for contributions made to such individual taxpayer's retirement account to qualify for the retirement savings tax deduction."
