Requires the compulsory licensing of manufacturers and importers of video recording equipment. Directs the Chairman of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to establish royalty fees to be paid by such manufacturers and importers. Sets forth a procedure for distributing such fees to the owners of copyright of audiovisual works included in television transmissions. Sets forth penalties for violations of these requirements."
