Extends the exterior boundary of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest to include all lands and waters within the monument. Provides for Federal acquisition of the lands within the monument. Sets the minimum value of any timber acquired at the fair market value of the timber on July 1, 1982. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to exchange certain lands with Burlington Northern Incorporated and with the Weyerhaeuser Company pursuant to voluntary mutual agreement. Provides that the instruments of conveyance for such exchanges may include mutually agreed upon reservations. Sets forth the requirements for such exchanges. Requires the Secretary to prepare an environmental assessment of any exchange of mineral or geothermal interests authorized by this Act. Requires the Secretary to administer the monument as a separate unit of the national forest system. Requires the Secretary to: (1) permit the full use of the monument for scientific study and research; (2) provide for recreational use of the monument; and (3) permit hunting and fishing within the monument. Authorizes the Secretary to impose any restrictions on these activities which are necessary to protect the public health and safety, the natural conditions and resources of the monument, scientific research activities, and public use and enjoyment. Provides that roads and other facilities within the monument should be located in areas developed before the 1980 eruption. Withdraws all Federal lands within the monument from entry or appropriation of disposal under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the Federal mining laws, and from disposition under mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Prohibits timber harvesting on Federal lands within the monument except: (1) for timber salvage contracts awarded before the enactment of this Act; and (2) where necessary to control fire, insects, diseases, and other agents dangerous to the monument. Permits the use of national forest system roads for such timber harvesting activities. Requires the Secretary to submit a comprehensive management plan for the monument to specified congressional committees within three years after enactment of this Act. Establishes the Mount Saint Helens Scientific Advisory Board to advise the Secretary on: (1) measures needed to protect and manage the natural and scientific values of the monument; and (2) the administration necessary to protect the natural ecologic and geologic processes and integrity of the monument. Authorizes the Board to make recommendations with respect to new scientific research opportunities which may exist within the monument. Terminates the Board ten years after the enactment of this Act. Requires that at least 50 percent of the revenues paid to Skamania County in the State of Washington from the Gifford Pinchot National Forest be used for the benefit of the public schools in Skamania County and that the remainder be used for such purposes as the county specifies. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years beginning after October 1, 1982."
