Title I: Amendments to Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 - Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, to require that any budget submitted to Congress by the President shall set forth a level of estimated expenditures which do not exceed receipts.

Requires the submission of balanced budgets by the Committees on the Budget of each House. Allows the Committees to submit two budgets, only one of which is balanced, if the Committees find it infeasible to submit a complying budget. Repeals provisions which require a second concurrent resolution on the budget. Revises certain reconciliation procedures. Provides that the budget resolution shall be binding unless waived by a three-fifths vote in either House of Congress. Requires the chairman of the House and Senate Budget Committees and a presidential appointee to meet and agree upon common economic and technical estimating assumptions to be used for preparation of the President's budget proposal. Requires, beginning with FY 1984, that the appropriate level of total budget outlays set forth in any concurrent resolution on the budget, as reported, for a fiscal year not exceed specified percentages of the Trend Gross National Product for such fiscal year. Sets forth the definition of the Trend Gross National Product for the purposes of this Act.
