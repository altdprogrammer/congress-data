    "text": "Neighborhood Development Demonstration Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to conduct a three-year demonstration program to determine the feasibility of assisting neighborhood development activities by providing Federal matching funds to certain nonprofit neighborhood development organizations on the basis of monetary support from the private sector. Authorizes the Secretary to select, through a competitive process, up to 50 organizations to participate in the program in the first year, 100 in the second, and 150 in the third. Directs the Secretary to establish a neighborhood development advisory council to evaluate the applicants and recommend selections. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assign each participating organization a program year during which time voluntary private contributions shall be eligible for matching; and (2) establish a ratio of between three and ten Federal dollars for each dollar contributed which the Secretary shall pay to each organization at the end of each three month period of the organization's program year. Limits the maximum amount the Secretary may pay to any organization for a year to $50,000. Requires the Secretary to assure that activities carried out by participating organizations: (1) are coordinated with local housing and community development programs; and (2) comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the activities carried out under this Act and any findings or recommendations concerning the demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations."
