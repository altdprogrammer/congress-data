Conditions such release upon a documented agreement between the Secretary and the University that the University will dispose of the land only for the purpose of acquiring real property which is more suitable for educational or recreational purposes. Declares that title for the acquired real property will vest in the United States if the University: (1) uses it for other than educational or recreational purposes; (2) attempts to transfer its title; or (3) directly or indirectly prohibits or restricts its use by any individual because of his or her race, creed, color, sex, or national origin. Requires the University to include the terms of its agreement with the Secretary in any document which transfers to the University property it acquires pursuant to the agreement. Declares that the authority of the Secretary to release patent conditions shall expire five years after enactment of this Act."
