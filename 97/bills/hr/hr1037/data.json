Directs the members of such Council to perform specified functions, including advising the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator regarding the activities of the National Employment Relocation Administration and evaluating the effectiveness of programs carried out under this Act. Title III: Notice, Investigations, Hearings, and Reports, in Closing an Establishment or Transferring Operations - Requires written notice to be given to the Secretary whenever: (1) a business concern intends to close or transfer all or part of its operations; and (2) at least 15 percent of the employees who are members of a labor organization or 15 percent of all employees in that establishment will suffer an eligible employment loss as a result of any such closing or transfer.
