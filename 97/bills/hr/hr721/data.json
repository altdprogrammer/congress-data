Requires both State regulated and nonregulated electric and gas utilities to transmit to State regulatory authorities weekly reports of involuntary terminations of service to consumers. Directs the State regulatory authorities to make such reports available to the public. Provides that during any period when termination of service to an electric or gas consumer would be dangerous to health, such service may not be terminated if the consumer establishes that he or she is able to pay in accordance with a qualified deferred payment program."
