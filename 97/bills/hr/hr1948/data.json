    "text": "Act to Combat International Terrorism - Directs the President to report biannually to Congress on acts of international terrorism or within 30 days of an incident affecting U.S. citizens or property. Directs the President to submit to Congress a list of nations which have demonstrated a pattern of support for international terrorism. Specifies sanctions to be imposed upon such nations, including: (1) denial of foreign assistance other than disaster relief; (2) an embargo on the sale of any defense articles under the Arms Export Control Act; and (3) denial of any application for a license to export defense articles or services or other exports having potential military application if such denial would reduce such nation's support of terrorism. Permits the President to suspend application of these sanctions in the interests of national security after consulting with the appropriate Congressional committees. Authorizes the President to exercise other sanctions, including suspension of air services. Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to assess the effectiveness of security measures maintained at foreign airports and report such assessments to Congress. Authorizes the Secretary, after notifying the appropriate foreign authorities, to restrict operations at foreign airports failing to bring their security measures to the standards and recommendations set forth at the Montreal Convention on International Civil Aviation. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to foreign governments for promoting aviation security. Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful for any person to manufacture, transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or import explosive material which does not contain an identification and detection taggant meeting the standards established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Phases in the effective date of such prohibitions from one to three years after enactment and permits the Secretary to extend such time periods. Amends the Federal criminal code to redefine the offense of \"destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities\" to, among other revisions: (1) prohibit communicating false information which endangers any aircraft in flight; (2) prohibit any act of violence against any individual on an aircraft which is likely to endanger the aircraft in service; and (3) define \"in service\" to mean pre- and post-flight ground preparation. Establishes a new Federal crime of \"imparting or conveying threats\" to commit an act which would constitute the felony of aircraft sabotage if executed. Amends the Federal Aviation Act to establish civil penalties for conveying false information regarding aircraft crimes and concealing a deadly weapon while boarding an aircraft. Makes any person who willfully and maliciously conveys false information criminally liable. Urges the President to seek international agreements to assure more effective cooperation in combating international terrorism."
