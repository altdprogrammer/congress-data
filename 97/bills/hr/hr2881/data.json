    "text": "Nuclear Waste Management Policy Act - Title I: Disposal of Transuranic Waste, High-Level Radioactive Waste, and Spent Nuclear Fuel - Directs the Secretary of Energy to issue guidelines for the recommendation of sites for repositories for the permanent disposal of transuranic waste, high-level radioactive waste, and spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to identify and recommend to the President at least two sites suitable for site characterization activities to determine their suitability for repositories. Directs the Secretary to notify the State Review Board of any State in which a site is located or the Indian tribe on whose reservation a site is located of such recommendation and to hold public hearings in the vicinity of any recommended site. Requires the President to: (1) review each site recommended; (2) either approve or disapprove the recommendation within 60 days; and (3) transmit such decision to the Secretary and the appropriate State Review Board. Provides that Presidential failure to approve or disapprove a site within the 60-day period or to invoke authority to delay the determination shall be considered an approval. Requires that, prior to the commencement of site characterization activities, the Secretary shall submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the appropriate State Review Board or Indian tribe for review: (1) an environmental assessment of the nonradiological impact of such activities; (2) a site characterization plan; and (3) proposals for the form or packaging of the waste and spent fuel which would be emplaced in the repository. Directs the Secretary to conduct tests at sites where site characterization activities are being conducted to provide the data needed for a construction authorization application for a repository and for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Sets forth restrictions on the use of radioactive materials during site characterization activities. Requires the Secretary to hold public hearings if a site is determined, after site characterization activities, to meet the requirements applicable to repositories. Directs the Secretary to submit a recommendation for site approval and a site report to the President if the Secretary affirms such determination after the hearings. Directs the President to recommend to Congress a site qualified as an initial repository. Requires recommendation of another site for an initial repository if Congress disapproves the President's first recommendation. Directs the Secretary to submit a license application to the appropriate State Review Board or Indian tribe. Requires the NRC to submit to Congress a status report on such application within two years of its submission by the Secretary. Requires final NRC approval or disapproval of such application within a specified time. Makes a site designation effective 30 days after the President recommends such site to Congress unless an affected State Review Board or Indian tribe submits a petition for disapproval of such site designation. Provides that if such petition is submitted, a site designation shall be effective unless Congress passes a resolution approving such petition. Authorizes a State Review Board to: (1) review activities under this Act to determine the effects of any repository located in the State; (2) represent the State in any NRC proceeding with respect to a repository site in such State; and (3) submit petitions requesting Congress to disapprove repository construction in such State. Directs the Secretary to make grants to the State Review Boards of each State in which a repository site has been approved to support Board activities. Directs the Secretary to consult and cooperate with affected State Review Boards and Indian tribes to resolve the State and tribal concerns regarding the public health and safety, environmental, and economic impacts of any repository. Authorizes the governing body of any affected Indian tribe to: (1) review activities under this Act to determine the effects of a repository located on the reservation; and (2) submit petitions requesting Congress to disapprove repository construction. Directs the Secretary to provide funds to any affected Indian tribe for activities pursuant to this Act. Provides for judicial review of agency actions relating to repository site designation and repository construction and operation pursuant to this Act. Requires Federal officers or agencies to issue or grant a certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization related to the characterization, construction, or initial operation of any recommended site at the earliest practicable date. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the NRC to promulgate, respectively, general environmental standards and application criteria for construction applications within a specified time. Requires any repository for the disposal of high-level waste and spent fuel to be designed and constructed so that the spent fuel may be retrieved. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to carry out this title. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to Congress proposing fees to be collected to offset all construction, operation, administrative, and other costs incurred in providing for the management, interim storage, and disposal of nuclear wastes and spent fuel. Makes any person or entity with title to any spent fuel, transuranic waste, or high-level radioactive waste which is subject to interim storage or permanent disposal by the Secretary responsible for transporting such fuel or waste to any interim storage or repository site. Requires the Secretary to submit annually from 1982 through 1987 a nuclear waste management plan to the President and Congress. Title II: Dry Storage Demonstration Program - Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with commercial nuclear powerplant owners to pay such owners the costs of designing and constructing dry storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel to be located at the sites of the powerplants where the fuel is generated. Directs the NRC to establish licensing requirements for dry storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel."
