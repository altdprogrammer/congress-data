    "text": "Family Farm Antitrust Act of 1981 - Finds that vertical integration within the agricultural industry by corporations engaged in the processing, distributing and retail industries, and other conglomerate corporations, tends to create monopolies in the agricultural industry and produce unfair competition for family farms, contributing to the decline of rural populations and the consequent crowding of metropolitan centers. Declares it to be the national policy to restore the competition to the agricultural industry and to provide for the continuance of the family farm. Amends the Clayton Act to provide that no person who is engaged in commerce in a business other than farming and whose nonfarming business assets exceed $5,000,000 shall engage in farming or the production of agricultural products or participate in farming by any means of acquisition or control of another person who is engaged in farming. Specifies exceptions including charitable, educational or nonprofit institutions, and farmer-owned and controlled cooperatives. Permits the continuation of farming interests by persons otherwise in violation of this Act if such interests are not increased or expanded for the five-year period following enactment of this Act. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire at fair market value any property or interest of which any person is required to divest themself of under the provisions of this Act if the person is otherwise unable to divest themself of such property or interest. Directs the Secretary to engage in specified enforcement activities including the exercise of any general investigatory authority vested in the Secretary, and to report to the Federal Trade Commission the results of such investigations. Authorizes the Secretary to submit recommendations to the Congress for adjustments to the limitation on nonfarming business assets to reflect changes in economic conditions."
