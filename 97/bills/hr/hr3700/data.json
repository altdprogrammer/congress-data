Directs the Secretary to: (1) designate Department of Transportation employees as regional career counselors who shall assist controllers in developing training programs; and (2) establish regional review boards to consider applications for training and evaluate training programs to determine whether such programs will result in successful training and job placement. Prohibits such a board from approving any program the duration of which exceeds two years. Requires that a controller, on request, receive assistance in being placed in a vacant position in another agency upon completion of training. Requires the Secretary to reimburse a controller for the expenses of approved training."
