    "text": "Broadcasting Public Responsibility and Deregulation Act of 1981 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a licensee evaluation system covering commercial television and radio broadcasting licensees. Requires the licensee evaluation system to: (1) assign a point value for broadcasting qualifying programing; and (2) award points to each licensee based on the minutes of qualifying programing broadcast by such licensee during each annual license period. Defines qualifying programing as public service programing and programing that has a direct relevance to persons residing in the licensee's service area. Excludes from such definition programing that originates outside the licensee's service area and is broadcast by the licensee for pay. Directs the FCC to establish a licensee rating schedule based on a review of a licensee's programing before the evaluation system becomes effective. Directs the FCC to determine whether different minimum point levels should be established for different categories of licensees. Directs the FCC to prescribe a rule establishing a public responsibility standard. Requires such standard to specify the number of points a licensee must accumulate to comply with the standard. States that this Act does not authorize the FCC to require licensees to broadcast a particular type of programing or to establish a particular type of broadcasting format, except that only qualifying programing shall be eligible for points. Requires the establishment of procedures under which the FCC shall issue, upon request, a binding declaratory judgment regarding: (1) the category of licensees in which a licensee belongs; and (2) whether a licensee is in compliance with the public responsibility standard. Requires licensees to keep public records indicating the number of points accumulated. Authorizes the FCC to take any action necessary to determine whether a licensee has violated the public responsibility requirements. Sets a civil penalty for licensees who consistently fail to comply with the public responsibility standard. Sets criminal penalties for persons who knowingly make false statements in specified records. Requires the FCC to report to Congress on: (1) actions taken to establish a public responsibility standard; and (2) the expected effective date of such standard. States that the FCC shall not have any authority to establish or enforce rules which require commercial television or radio broadcasting station licensees or license applicants to: (1) ascertain the interests of persons residing in the station's service areas; (2) limit the number or length of commercial advertisements; or (3) establish or maintain any specific format for programing logs. Increases the terms of broadcast licenses and license renewals to ten years. Authorizes an application for a broadcast station construction permit and an application for a broadcast station license to be submitted on a joint application. Deletes the provision which requires construction of a station to be completed and approved by the FCC before the FCC will grant a license to operate the station. Prohibits the FCC from considering a competing application for a broadcast station's facilities when considering the broadcast station licensee's application for renewal. Deletes the provisions concerning: (1) petitions to deny broadcast license applications; and (2) hearings on such license applications. Excludes from the equal time rule a broadcast of an interview, discussion, or debate by a legally qualified candidate regardless of whether such interview, discussion, or debate is a regularly scheduled program."
