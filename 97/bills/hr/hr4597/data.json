    "text": "Title I: Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to declare that certain permits for exploration, development, or production on the Outer Continental Shelf must be granted or refused within 90 days after application. Revises oil and gas leasing procedures to require, among other things, the deposit of cash bids for such leases in interest-bearing accounts. Prohibits a court from hearing and determining a civil action to enjoin a lease sale held under such Act unless such action is commenced within 45 days after notice of such sale. Revises criminal penalties for violations of such Act. Redefines \"small refiner\" for purposes of such Act. Title II: Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 to redefine \"facility\" to include areas leased under an oil and gas lease pursuant to such Act. Revises the scope of liability of owners and operators of non-public vessels or offshore facilities that are the source of oil pollution. Repeals specified reporting requirements concerning shut-in and flaring oil and gas wells. Title III: Amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 - Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to revise provisions concerning Federal and State cooperation in regard to activities affecting land or water uses in coastal zones. Title IV: National Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Block Grants - Establishes the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Fund into which the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay five percent of all rental and royalties received from Outer Continental Shelf leases. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, beginning in fiscal year 1984 and annually thereafter, to provide national ocean and coastal resource management block grants to coastal States according to specified criteria. Lists activities for which such grants may be used. Requires such States to submit an evaluation assessment on the expenditure of block grant funds to the Secretary."
