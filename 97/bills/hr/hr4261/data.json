Increases the minimum sentence to ten years for offenses involving over 2,000 pounds of marihuana, 28 grams of opium, or 400 grams of cocaine. Establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years for repeat offenders. Prohibits the granting of probation or parole or the suspension of any such sentences. Increases the penalties for offenses involving phencyclidine (PCP) from ten years' imprisonment and/or a $25,000 fine to 15 years' imprisonment and/or a $50,000 fine. Establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment for distributing a controlled substance to a person under 18 years of age. Amends the Bail Reform Act of 1966 to authorize a judicial officer, in making a determination of whether a person charged with a noncapital offense should be released on bail, to consider whether the offender poses a danger to the community or any other person (in addition to assurance of appearance as currently provided)."
