    "text": "Social Services Amendments of 1981 - Amends title XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Social Security Act to increase the total amount allocable to the States for social services. Sets forth a formula for the distribution of such funds among the States based on the number of individuals in a State who are: (1) receiving aid under the program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children; (2) either under the age of five or over the age of 65; and (3) members of families with incomes below the national nonfarm poverty line. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for the purposes of determining the number of individuals below the national poverty line, to exclude from income all cash transfer payments based on need and made from public funds. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress with respect to the adequacy of the income data available from the 1980 census for use in making such determinations. Requires a State seeking payments under title XX to provide a comprehensive training plan for personnel providing services under title XX. Permits a State to accept restricted private funds under title XX for the training of personnel so long as such restrictions are consistent with the State plan. Authorizes appropriations under title XX for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands for specified social services programs. Permits a State to develop a multiyear plan under title XX. Authorizes payment for emergency shelter for adults in danger of physical or mental injury, neglect, maltreatment or exploitation. Prohibits payment for such shelter for more than 30 days in any six month period."
