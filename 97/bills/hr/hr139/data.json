Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish guidelines with respect to the explanation of the side effects, risks, contraindications, and effectiveness of drugs and devices intended for use by pregnant women. Deems misbranded any drug or device offered for sale to a pregnant woman which does not meet such guidelines. Directs the Secretary to arrange for a study to determine the long-term side effects, risks, contraindications, and effectiveness of obstetrical drugs, devices, and procedures with respect to maternal health and child development and to report to Congress concerning such study. Authorizes appropriations for such study."
