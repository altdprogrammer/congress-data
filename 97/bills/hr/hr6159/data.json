Requires the Administrator for Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget to submit to Congress a plan which: (1) reviews the extent, type, and quality of risk analysis presently being carried out within, by, and outside Federal agencies; (2) recommends specific areas for emphasis for research and funding; (3) recommends a coordinating mechanism to transmit and share research results among Federal agencies and other institutions; (4) plans for prototypical risk analysis demonstrations; and (5) recommends methods of increasing public awareness. Requires specified Federal agencies to recommend to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy research that should be done by such agencies. Directs the National Science Foundation to recommend a program of research to strengthen the basic and applied sciences required to support Federal agencies in utilizing risk analysis methods, including improved data gathering methods. Requires the Director to coordinate such recommended research programs. Requires specified Federal agencies to undertake a prototypical risk analysis study: (1) utilizing new developments when available; (2) comparing the risk of alternative courses of action; (3) delineating scientific from policy judgments; (4) identifying limits placed on the analysis due to relevant organizational and statutory constraints; and (5) identifying tradeoffs. Directs the Administrator to transmit a report to Congress summarizing the risk analysis being carried out and making recommendations for future research and legislative changes."
