Enumerates circumstances under which an assignment or transportation is not reasonable, including if: (1) there are reasonable alternatives available; (2) the plan is likely to have a net harmful effect on the quality of education; or (3) the time or distance traveled exceeds, by specified amounts, the time or distance to the closest public school."
