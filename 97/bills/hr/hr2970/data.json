Permits the Secretary of Defense, in carrying out the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ministers of Defense concerning the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Program, to waive reimbursement for the cost of specified functions performed by other than AWACS personnel and to assume contingent liability for program losses and specified charges for fiscal year 1982. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Authorizes appropriations for the armed forces for research, development, test, and evaluation for fiscal year 1982. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act for 1971 to repeal the requirement for an annual report on independent research and development and bid and proposal costs. Title III: Operation and Maintenance - Authorizes appropriations for the armed forces and for other activities and agencies of the Department of Defense. Authorizes additional sums for increases in benefits for civilian employees of the Department of Defense. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Defense submit to Congress an annual report on the operation and maintenance of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps. Title IV: Active Forces - Establishes end strength levels for fiscal year 1982 for active duty personnel for the Army, Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force.

Title VII: Military Training Student Loads - Establishes average military training student loads for fiscal year 1982. Title VIII: General Provisions - Amends the Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1976, to repeal the cancellation charge ceiling on multiyear procurement contracts.
