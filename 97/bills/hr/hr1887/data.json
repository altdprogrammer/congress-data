    "text": "Department of Defense-Veterans' Administration Health Care Planning and Improvements Act - Title I: Use of Veterans' Administration Medical Resources in Treating Members of the Armed Forces Injured During a Period of War or Other Armed Conflict - Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to furnish hospital care to any member of the Armed Forces for a service-connected disability incurred or aggravated during a period of war or other armed conflict. Requires the Secretary of Defense to certify to the Administrator that the Armed Forces lack the capacity to furnish such care because of the number of casualties sustained during such conflict. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations, not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, to ensure that such members are given priority for hospital care over all other persons except veterans in need of such care for service-connected disabilities. Title II: Interagency Sharing of Medical Resources - Establishes the Federal Interagency Health Resources Committee to be composed of the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs. Directs the Committee to: (1) evaluate the opportunities for the interagency sharing of health resources between the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration; (2) prescribe policies and procedures for such interagency sharing; and (3) within 180 days after enactment of this Act, prescribe guidelines for such interagency sharing to the directors of health care facilities of the Department and the Administration. Requires such guidelines to provide that: (1) the director of each facility shall enter into cooperative arrangements for providing health care to beneficiaries of other facilities; (2) the availability of medical care to beneficiaries of an agency other than the providing agency shall be on a referral basis; (3) an agency shall be reimbursed for a medical service provided to a beneficiary of another agency; and (4) sharing agreements shall be operative upon agreement by medical facility directors unless disapproved by an agency involved. Directs the Administration and the Department to submit to specified Congressional committees an annual report regarding interagency medical resource sharing activities."
