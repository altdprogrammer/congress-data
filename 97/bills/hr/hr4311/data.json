Stipulates that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall have no authority to consider employment practice charges by such employees. Permits a legislative employee who has cause to believe that discrimination has occurred to file an action in any appropriate Federal district court. Authorizes the court, upon a finding that the respondent has engaged in an intentional unlawful employment practice, to require that the complainant be hired for an appropriate type of position (but not specific position) in the legislative branch."
