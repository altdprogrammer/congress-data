    "text": "House Committee on Agriculture Reconciliation Measures - Subtitle A: Reductions in Authorizations for Appropriations - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to extend the food stamp program, at reduced funding levels, through fiscal year 1985. Makes reduced authorizations and limits outlays for each of fiscal years 1982 through 1984 for: (1) dairy indemnity payments by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service; (2) marketing activities payments to States and possessions by the Agricultural Marketing Service; (3) specified rural development assistance grants by the Farmers Home Administration; (4) Soil Conservation Service and other agricultural conservation program expenses; (5) international programs under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480); (6) specified expenses of the Forest Service (but not for the Bald Mountain road and timber sale in the Siskiyou National Forest); and (7) salaries and expenses of certain agencies, offices, and functions of the Department of Agriculture. Subtitle B: Reduction in Direct Spending - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set a new formula for the determination of the price support for milk during fiscal years 1982 through 1985. Limits the range of support from 75 percent to 90 percent of parity, keyed to net Government price support purchases of nonfat dry milk and the milk equivalent of butter and cheese. Requires an increase of the support price whenever dairy product imports are increased due to an expansion of imports or a termination of import restraints. Requires semiannual adjustments of such support price. Directs the Secretary to notify the congressional agriculture committees thirty days before the effective date of a new support level. Amends the United States Grain Standards Act, for fiscal years 1982 through 1984, to authorize the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service to collect inspection fees to defray administrative and supervisory costs. Limits such costs, for fiscal years 1982 through 1985, to 35 percent of the total costs of the Service. Authorizes appropriations for such years. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an advisory committee to advise the Administrator on the implementation of the United States Grain Standards Act of 1976. Amends the United States Cotton Standards Act, the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act, and the United States Cotton Futures Act to direct the Secretary to collect directly from participating producers cotton classing and loose cotton sale fees in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of such services, including administrative and supervisory costs. Limits the net cost estimate used to calculate such fees to specified amounts for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Directs the Secretary to impose charges for establishing cotton standards. Credits all such fees and charges to the current appropriation incurring such costs and leaves them available until expended. Exempts from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 any cotton samples submitted in compliance with the requirements of such Acts and thereby becoming United States property. Requires the Secretary to hold annual meetings with cotton industry representatives to review such activities. Amends the Tobacco Inspection Act to direct the Secretary to fix and collect fees for inspection and certification, the establishment of standards, sampling and weighing, and other services at designated auction markets. Requires such fees to cover the costs of such services, including administrative and supervisory costs. Credits such fees to the current appropriation incurring such costs and leaves them available until expended. Requires assessment of such fees against warehouse operators, who shall collect them from tobacco sellers. Directs the Secretary to set up a national advisory committee of tobacco producers, with advisory subcommittees for each major kind of tobacco, to advise him about such services and fees. Amends the United States Warehouse Act to direct the Secretary to collect warehouse examination, inspection, and licensing fees sufficient to cover the costs of such services and licenses, including administrative and supervisory costs. Limits the amounts of such fees for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Authorizes appropriations for other services under such Act. Repeals the Naval Stores Act relating to standards and prohibitions regarding commerce in spirits of turpentine and rosin. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to allow interest rates equal to the current market yield for municipal bonds for direct or insured loans to public bodies or nonprofit associations for water and waste disposal facilities and essential community facilities. Limits to five percent per annum the interest rate on such loans for facility upgrading or new facility construction in poverty areas. Sets the range for interest rates on direct or insured low-income farm ownership loans at between five percent per annum and one-half the current market yield on United States bonds. Requires a two percent per annum additional interest rate on any direct or insured loan to a State or local government for construction of certain facilities on prime farmland where non-prime farmland is available. Marks for such treatment certain facilities for: (1) recreational uses; (2) rural small business enterprises; (3) electrical transmission systems; (4) pollution abatement and control; and (5) subterminal uses. Limits to 90 percent of actual production loss the amount of farming, ranching, or aquaculture production loss for which an applicant may receive an emergency loan. Reduces the total amount of certain insurable rural development loans for fiscal year 1982: (1) from $1,000,000,000 to $300,000,000 for water and waste facilities; and (2) from $500,000,000 to $130,000,000 for community facilities. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to eliminate certain waiver of interest provisions so the Secretary may collect interest on loans made on the 1980 and 1981 crops of wheat and feed grains placed in the farmer-held reserve. Reduces to $52,000,000 the ceiling on administrative expenses of the Commodity Credit Corporation for fiscal year 1982."
