    "text": "Agricultural Trade Negotiation Act of 1982 - Directs the President to determine whether any country has failed to provide trade concessions for U.S. agricultural products that are substantially equivalent to the concessions that the United States provides for that country's agricultural products. Directs the President, if the President makes an affirmative determination, to: (1) withdraw trade concessions with respect to that country's agricultural products; and (2) submit to Congress the legislative proposals necessary to withdraw the trade concessions. Requires the withdrawal of trade concessions to remain in effect until trade restrictions on U.S. agricultural goods are removed. Directs the President, if a country is imposing quotas on U.S. agricultural goods that severely limit imports of such goods, to: (1) seek the remedy available under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); or (2) withdraw trade concessions with respect to the offending country's agricultural goods if no remedy exists under the GATT. Requires the agricultural products of a country to be dutiable at the rates provided under column two of the Tariff Schedules of the United States if the country: (1) maintains quotas on imports of U.S. agricultural products; (2) uses import licensing practices that restrict the importation of U.S. agricultural products; or (3) subsidizes exports."
