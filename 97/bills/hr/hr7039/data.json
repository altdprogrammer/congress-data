    "text": "Title I: Protection of Government Witnesses - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Attorney General to relocate and protect witnesses and their families involved in Federal or State trials of violent offenses. Authorizes the Attorney General to take action to protect the person from bodily injury or otherwise to assure the health, safety, and welfare of that person. Requires any person protected under this Act to enter into an agreement with the Attorney General. Requires the agreement to set forth such person's responsibilities, including agreement: (1) if an actual or potential witness, to provide information to all appropriate law enforcement officials and testify in all proceedings; (2) to refrain from committing any act punishable by a prison term; (3) to take all necessary steps to avoid detection by others of the facts concerning the protection provided; and (4) to cooperate with all reasonable requests of government employees. Establishes a procedure for the termination of protection upon substantive breach of such agreement. Allows for notice to the witness with an opportunity for a hearing. Provides for service of process on a protected person and compliance with a judgment in a civil proceeding. Requires all Federal agencies to cooperate with the Attorney General in carrying out this Act. Allows the Attorney General to agree with a State government to provide protection for a person. Title II: United States Marshals Service and Service of Process - Revises the United States Marshals Service System. Authorizes the Attorney General to appoint a director and other officials. Specifies the powers and duties of the Service. Grants an official of the Service the same powers that a State sheriff may exercise. Prescribes the schedule of fees that the Service may collect. Amends Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to revise service of process."
