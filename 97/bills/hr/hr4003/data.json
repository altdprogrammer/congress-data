Requires the Secretary to pay a benefit check presented for payment after it has been credited to one of the trust funds if it is otherwise proper. Authorizes appropriations to reimburse the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for the total amount of unnegotiated benefit checks."
