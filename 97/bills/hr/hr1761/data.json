Provides that mentally retarded persons who are inmates at small community residences, at which there are no more than 15 residents, shall be eligible for supplemental security income benefits. Excludes from income for purposes of determining such benefits housing assistance payments made under the United States Housing Act. States that mentally retarded persons unable to continue working by reason of such impairment shall not be considered ineligible. Requires that applications for benefits shall be acted upon within a maximum of 60 days. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate the administration of the supplemental security benefits program with the administration of other programs providing assistance, assuring that SSI recipients are aware of the availability of other assistance."
