    "text": "Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Act - Revises title V (Maternal and Child Health and Crippled Children's Services) of the Social Security Act. Renames such title, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Act. States that the purposes of such title shall be to enable each State to: (1) reduce infant mortality; (2) reduce the incidence of preventable diseases and handicapping conditions among low-income children; (3) increase the availability of prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care to low-income women; (4) increase the number of children immunized; (5) increase the number of low-income children receiving health assessments and followup diagnostic and treatment services; and (6) provide medically necessary services to handicapped children, and to enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for projects and research with respect to maternal and child health and handicapped children, grants to train personnel, and grants relating to hemophilia. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 of an amount equal to the sum of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1982 to carry out the consolidated health programs. Defines consolidated health programs to mean programs of: (1) title V; (2) supplemental security income for disabled children (title XVI of the Act); (3) lead-based paint poisoning prevention, sudden infant death syndrome, and hemophilia under the Public Health Services Act; and (4) adolescent pregnancy of the Health Services and Centers Amendments of 1978. Authorizes appropriations for succeeding fiscal years based upon the 1982 amount. Sets forth provisions providing for the allotment of amounts appropriated. Directs the Secretary to use ten percent of such amount for: (1) special projects contributing to the advancement of maternal and child health or services for handicapped children; (2) research projects relating to maternal and child health services or handicapped services; and (3) the continuation of funding of grants to train personnel for health care, and comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic and treatment centers. Directs the Secretary to fund 50 percent of a State's expenses in carrying out title V. Prohibits a State from using grant money for: (1) cash payments to intended recipients of health services; (2) the purchase or improvement of land or any building or the purchase of major medical equipment; or (3) satisfying any requirement for the expenditure of non-federal funds as a condition for the receipt of Federal funds. Requires a State, in order to receive an allotment, to: (1) transmit to the Secretary annually a description of the intended use of payments; and (2) transmit to the Secretary assurances that: (a) the State health agency will be responsible for the administration of allotted funds; (b) the State will fairly allocate allotted funds; (c) use allotted funds to provide services under the consolidated health programs; (d) provide that of the funds allotted a State: (i) no more than ten percent will be used for program administration; (ii) no more than ten percent will be used for training and technical assistance; (iii) at least 80 percent will be used to provide health services; and (iv) a reasonable proportion will be used to carry out the purposes of this Act; (e) provide that if a State imposes any charges for health services assisted by the State under title V, such charges will be adjusted to reflect income and will not be imposed on low-income mothers and children; and (f) identify and apply guidelines for the appropriate frequency and content of health care assessments and services. Requires each State to annually: (1) report to the Secretary on its activities under this title; and (2) audit its expenditures under this title. Sets forth provisions relative to this title concerning: (1) criminal penalties for false statements; (2) nondiscrimination; (3) administration; (4) repeals and conforming amendments; and (5) effective date and transitions."
