Declares such coins legal tender and prohibits their minting or distribution after December 31, 1984. Sets forth requirements for the sales of such coins, including surcharge payments to the Louisiana World Exposition, Incorporated, for use in staging and promoting the Exposition. Requires the Corporation to remit all remaining amounts to the Secretary, on June 1, 1985, for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury. Authorizes the Comptroller General to examine all pertinent records of the Corporation. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the issuance of the coins results in no net costs to the United States. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress at the end of each calendar quarter on the activities carried out under this Act."
