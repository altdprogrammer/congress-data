    "text": "Weatherization and Employment Act of 1982 - Amends the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 (which is title IV of the Energy Conservation and Production Act) to authorize appropriations for FY 1983 through 1993 for the Part A program of weatherization assistance for low-income persons. Directs the Secretary of Energy to allot at least ten percent of such appropriations to a performance fund to assist States which have demonstrated the best performance in the weatherization program. Makes individuals who have been unemployed for 17 weeks or more eligible for employment under the weatherization program. Revises provisions relating to maximum allowable expenditures per dwelling under the weatherization program. Revises provisions relating to deadlines for assistance to States under the weatherization program. Declares that no Part A provision shall be construed to limit the eligibility of low-income persons for weatherization program assistance to elderly or handicapped low-income persons. Requires that weatherization program regulations permit States to use program funds to provide information, education, and technical assistance to residents of low-income dwellings in which weatherization materials have been installed under the program. Authorizes the Secretary to use program funds to disseminate information on successful programs for the weatherization of existing multifamily dwellings. Includes furnace efficiency modifications under the definition of \"weatherization materials,\" for purposes of such program. Requires weatherization program grant applicants to submit an appropriate plan for the training of weatherization workers, crew supervisors, and field staff. Permits technical assistance funds to be used for such training."
