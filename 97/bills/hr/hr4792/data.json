    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Military Justice Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to state that a member of an armed force receiving a sentence from a court-martial which includes an unsuspended dismissal or bad-conduct discharge may be required to take leave pending completion of the action. Makes such leave chargeable against accrued or excess leave. Precludes the accrual or reception of pay or allowances during involuntary leave. Excludes such persons from the right to reemployment of inducted persons. Exempts such persons from the restriction on off-post civilian employment. Requires payment for leave charged as excess leave, minus earnings received during such leave, whenever such a sentence is set aside or disapproved by a Court of Military Review or the United States Court of Military Appeals. Prohibits punishment before trial without regard to the effective date of sentences. Permits the accused to be represented by more than one military counsel only as specified. Extends from 30 to 60 days the period during which an accused may petition the Court of Military Appeals for review of a decision of a Court of Military Review. Requires an application for modification or vacation of a sentence or findings in a court-martial case which has been finally reviewed, but not reviewed by a Court of Military Review, to be made within two years of sentencing."
