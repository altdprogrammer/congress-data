Title II: Prohibition on Sale of Gold Bullion - Amends the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 to require Congressional authorization to sell gold bullion. Title III: Prohibition of Seizure of Privately Owned Gold - Amends the Trading With the Enemy Act to repeal the President's authority to regulate transactions in gold or silver coin or bullion during the time of war. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to repeal the Secretary's authority to require the exchange of gold coins, bullion, and certificates for other U.S. currency if necessary to protect the U.S. currency system. Repeals certain provisions of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 prohibiting gold coinage. Reaffirms the constitutional right of the people to hold gold. Title IV: Repeal of Legal Tender Laws - Repeals specified provisions concerning gold and silver coins and bullion, clad coins, currency, and other legal tender. Repeals all other provisions conferring legal tender status upon any monetary instrument.

Directs the Secretary and the Federal Reserve to cease issuing Federal Reserve and U.S. notes on enactment of this Act. Title VI: Open Banking - Requires all banks to keep sufficient money in their possession at all times to cover all outstanding promises to pay a sum of money on demand.
