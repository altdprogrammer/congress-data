Provides that the Marshal and the Supreme Court Police shall have authority: (1) to police the Supreme Court Building, grounds, and adjacent streets; (2) to protect the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, any Associate Justice, any official guest of the Court, and any employee performing official duties, in any part of the United States; (3) to make arrests in the performance of the above duties; and (4) to carry firearms. Terminates the authority to protect the Chief Justice, any Associate Justice, any official guest, and any employee three years after enactment. Directs the Marshal, during the three year effective period, to report to Congress annually regarding the administrative cost of carrying out such duties. Requires that the Justices identify their official guests and provide written authorization for the Supreme Court Police to carry firearms while protecting such official guests outside of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Repeals the requirement that the Marshal of the Supreme Court shall publish regulations deemed necessary for the protection of the Supreme Court Building and grounds in a local newspaper for ten days prior to their effective date, and substitutes a requirement that regulations be posted at the Supreme Court Building and be made reasonably available to the public in writing. Retains the authority of the Metropolitan police force of the District of Columbia to make arrests within the Supreme Court Building and grounds. Provides that the Supreme Court grounds shall be held to include specified lots in the District of Columbia acquired as an addition to the grounds of the United States Supreme Court Building. Directs the Marshal to oversee the Supreme Court Police."
