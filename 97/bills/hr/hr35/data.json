Extends such offense to include using or carrying a destructive device or any dangerous or deadly weapon. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense from two to 25 years to five to 25 years for a second or subsequent offender. Extends to first offenders the directions, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or grant probation and that the additional sentence not run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the offense itself. Prohibits the granting of parole to any such offender."
