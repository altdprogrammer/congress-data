    "text": "National Export Policy Act of 1981 - Title I: General Findings and Purposes - Sets forth Congressional findings and the purposes of this Act. Title II: Export Financing - Declares it to be the policy of the Congress that the Export-Import Bank of the United States should facilitate, particularly in the presence of foreign officially-supported export credit competition, exports to countries: (1) having insufficient access to international credit facilities; (2) demonstrating reasonable economic progress; and (3) offering adequate formal assurances of repayment (currently, must offer sufficient likelihood of repayment). Increases the aggregate amount of loans and contractual liability of guarantees and insurance which may be outstanding at any one time. Requires such activities to be carried out through the Export Expansion Facility. Provides for the capitalization of such Facility. Amends the Export- Import Bank Act of 1945 to establish staggered, ten-year terms of office for the Bank directors. Declares that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees should consider limitations on Bank activities when considering appropriations for international trade activities rather than when considering foreign assistance activities. Title III: Export - Related Tax Policy - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the earned income exclusion for citizens working abroad, who are bona fide residents of a foreign country, from an annual rate of $20,000 to $50,000 plus 50 percent of any compensation which exceeds $50,000. Allows separate exclusions to married individuals who are both working overseas, although one's excess exclusion cannot be used against income earned by the other. Provides a tax exclusion for such individuals for the amount by which their housing expenses exceed 16 percent of a GS-14, step 1 salary level for a Federal employee. Permits such individuals to include in the computation of housing expenses the costs of a second foreign household if such an individual's family resides outside the United States but not with the individual because of adverse living conditions where the individual resides. Repeals similar deductions for cost-of-living differential, schooling expenses, home leave travel expenses, and residence in a hardship area. Excludes from an employee's gross income any lodging furnished the employee by an employer in a camp which meets specified requirements. Repeals the current provisions relating to deductions for certain expenses of living abroad. Provides that the foreign bad debt loss deduction shall not exceed the greater of 15 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income from exports, or two percent of the taxpayer's export receivables outstanding at the close of the taxable year. Provides that the amount of bad debt losses that may be added to a bad debt reserve shall not exceed five percent of the taxpayer's export receivables outstanding as of the close of the taxable year. Permits the amortization, based on a period of 60 months, of: (1) foreign market studies; (2) foreign marketing expenses; and (3) foreign patents. Permits an income tax deduction for currency fluctuation losses on export credit which have not been repaid by the end of the taxable year. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to extend the six-month deadline for exempting exports from the manufacturers excise tax for an additional 12 months if it is determined, after consultation with the Secretary of State, that exports were delayed because of war, civil unrest, or similar adverse conditions in a foreign nation. Amends the Foreign Trade Zones Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to approve the duty-free entry of machinery, materials, and fuels to be used for the production of goods in a foreign trade zone if such goods are not subsequently entered into U.S. customs territory. Sets forth requirements before applications for such treatment will be approved. Makes such approval valid for six years. Requires the Foreign Trade Zones Board to include in its annual report to Congress a summary of activities and proposals to increase the use of foreign trade zones to expand U.S. exports. Makes banking organizations which have invested in an export trading company eligible for treatment as domestic international sales corporations (DISC). Includes as qualified export receipts the gross receipts from the export of services produced in the United States and from export trade services in the case of a DISC which is an export trading company. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, with the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and distribute information concerning the utilization of the DISC provisions. Makes export trading companies eligible for Subchapter S treatment if the shareholders of such companies are otherwise small business corporations. Exempts such companies from restrictions on the amount of foreign income they can receive and still be eligible for Subchapter S tax treatment. Title IV: Antitrust - Amends the Webb-Pomerene Act to exempt the export trade, export trade activities, and methods of operation of certified export trade associations and export trading companies from the antitrust laws. Delays the effectiveness of any certificate upon the notification of the Secretary of Commerce by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of disagreement with the decision to issue a certificate. Sets forth the procedure to be followed by any association, company, or export trading company seeking certification under this Act and by the Secretary in issuing such certificates. Permits automatic certification for existing associations. Provides for appeal of the Secretary's denial of certification. Authorizes the Attorney General or the FTC to bring an action to invalidate a certification. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General and the FTC, to publish certification guidelines. Requires certified associations and export trading companies to submit annual reports to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to establish within the Department of Commerce an Office of Export Trade. Requires such Office to report annually to the appropriate Congressional committees on all East-West trade transactions requiring validated licenses and on the role of U.S. export trading companies in such trade. Grants a temporary exemption from the Sherman Act antitrust provisions for existing associations. Requires, with specified exceptions, that all applications for certification be kept confidential. Authorizes the Secretary to require an association or trading company to modify its operation to be consistent with international obligations of the United States. Directs the President to appoint, with the Senate's advice and consent, a task force, seven years after enactment, to examine the effect of this Act and to make recommendations. Directs the Attorney General to study whether: (1) U.S. business conduct to expand exports conflicts with basic antitrust principles; and (2) a more liberal enforcement policy for overseas activities would impede implementation of the antitrust laws. Requires the Attorney General to identify conduct which would not warrant prosecution under the antitrust laws. Sets forth the procedures for describing such permissible conduct and disclosing such descriptions. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to intervene in such suits and to provide legal assistance to exporters. Prohibits prosecution under the antitrust laws of exporters who: (1) have notified the Attorney General of their intention to engage in such designated conduct; or (2) receive an approval, or no objection, from the Attorney General concerning proposed transactions. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress concerning implementation of this section. Authorizes appropriations for the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce for carrying out the simplification of antitrust procedures. Title V: Amendments to Other Laws That Hinder Exports - Changes the name of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) to the Business Practices and Records Act. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require securities issuers to maintain an internal accounting system that provides reasonable assurance that specified accountability and accuracy goals are met. Changes the criterion for finding liability for violations of accounting standards. Makes persons who intentionally violate the accounting standards liable for such violations (currently persons who know or have reason to know of violations of the accounting standards are liable for such violations). Requires only good faith efforts at ensuring compliance by issuers who hold 50 percent or less of the equity of domestic or foreign firms. Transfers from the Security and Exchange Commission to the Department of Justice jurisdiction to enforce the antibribery prohibitions of the FCPA with respect to issuers. Replaces the current \"knowing or reason to know\" standard for liability for illegal payments to intermediaries with a standard that makes a firm liable if the firm intends to direct or authorize an illegal payment. Exempts from such prohibition any payment to a foreign official including items of value given in return for hospitality or in token of regard and esteem, and marketing or demonstration expenses pertaining to the business presentation. Makes the provision in the Business Practices and Records Act the exclusive Federal law authorizing Federal proceedings against a domestic concern for using the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce to violate such Act. Requires an interagency task force to issue guidelines specifying permissible conduct and arrangements associated with common types of export sales arrangements and business contracts and precautionary procedures creating a rebuttable presumption of compliance. Provides for the establishment of a Business Practices and Records Act Review Procedure to answer specific inquiries concerning enforcement of such Act. Requires the Attorney General to issue opinions regarding compliance. Makes such opinions final and binding on all parties if the conduct does not involve a violation. Requires annual reports to Congress by: (1) the Attorney General concerning actions taken pursuant to such Act; and (2) the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the reporting requirements. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should negotiate agreements establishing standards of conduct for international business practices, a resolution procedure, and rates of commissions. Directs the President to report to Congress concerning the progress of such negotiations. Requires Congress to review the Business Practices and Records Act after receiving the President's report. Directs the President to report to Congress on the legal and practical consequences of specific action that the United States could take under existing law to: (1) promote international cooperation to prevent bribery of foreign officials, candidates, or parties in third countries; and (2) encourage persons or businesses operating in foreign countries to refrain from bribing foreign officials, candidates, or parties to the disadvantage of U.S. industry. Requires the report to contain recommendations for new legislation and an analysis of the potential effect on U.S. interests of the corruption of foreign officials and political leaders. Requires an export competitiveness impact statement from any issuing authority taking significant action which could affect adversely U.S. exports or the international competitive position of the United States and its exporters. Expresses the sense of Congress that export paperwork must be reduced to encourage export sales. Requires all agencies to minimize paperwork and reporting requirements. Title VI: Export Awareness and Export Promotion Programs - Export Trading Company Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to promote export trading companies by providing information and by facilitating contacts between producers of exportable goods and export trading companies. Authorizes any banking organization to invest specified amounts in export trading companies upon notifying, but without obtaining the prior approval of, the appropriate Federal banking agency, if such investment does not cause an export trading company to become a subsidiary of such organization. Allows greater investment by Edge Act Corporations not engaged in banking. Permits any banking organization to invest beyond such limitations with prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency. Requires prior notification of such agencies in specified circumstances. Sets forth further limitations on export trading companies and investments by banking organizations. Specifies factors to be taken into consideration by the banking agencies. Permits such agencies to impose conditions in approving applications to invest in export trading companies.

Sets a maximum of $750,000 which may be committed to any borrower from the business loan and investment revolving fund.
