Requires the Commission to certify to the Secretary of the Treasury any awards made. Authorizes the Secretary to make payments of the lesser of $10,000 or the principal amount of an award. Deducts two percent of the amount of an award as reimbursement to the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and other agencies for expenses incurred in the arbitration of the claim.

Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for expenses incurred in the settlement or arbitration of such claims."
