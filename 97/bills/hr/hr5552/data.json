    "text": "National Park System Protection Act of 1982 - Permits the Secretary of the Interior to issue leases for, authorize use or development of, or sell or dispose of, lands or waters within, adjacent to, or related to, any National Park System unit only after a determination that the exercise of such authority will not impair the values for which the park unit was established. Requires Federal agencies conducting activities affecting a park unit to insure that such activities will not injure or degrade any of the park unit's resources or values. Prohibits the commencement of any activity affecting a park unit after enactment of this Act unless the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, determines that no injury or degradation of the park unit's resources or values will result. Requires an applicant for a license or permit to conduct activity affecting a park unit or for financial assistance for any such activity to include with the application a certification approved by the Secretary that the proposed activity will not injure or degrade the park unit's resources or values. Permits a person to bring an action against the Secretary or a Federal agency for any violation of this Act. Requires the Secretary to bring an action against any person, including a State or local government, whose activities will harm a park unit's resources. Sets forth procedural requirements for such actions. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should select for the post of Director of the National Park Service someone with the highest level of professional experience and expertise in fields relevant to the post's administrative duties. Requires the Secretary to direct the National Park Service to conduct a research program on the natural and cultural resources of the National Park System. Provides for the maintenance of the data and information obtained through such program in a National Park System resource data center. Makes such data and information available to the public and Congress. Requires the Secretary to submit biennial reports to Congress on the state of the National Park System. Directs the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees an analysis of the most critical natural and cultural resource threats in the system. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance, upon request, to local governments which have land use control authority over private lands adjacent to any park unit to help develop land use plans and zoning ordinances. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local governments for such purposes. Provides for the cessation of all disbursements from the Treasury to the Secretary if the Secretary has failed or refused to comply with any requirements of this Act. Provides for termination of the cessation if the Comptroller General determines that the Secretary has complied with the provision involved. Provides that any officer or employee subject to such cessation order shall be considered to be on furlough status during the period of time for which disbursements have ceased. Authorizes appropriations."
