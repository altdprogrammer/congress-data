Requires such reclamation activities to be conducted in accordance with a plan submitted pursuant to specified provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 or other Federal or State law which imposes substantially similar reclamation and permit requirements. Prohibits revocation of such an election without the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. Permits qualified reclamation expenses which are attributable to activities conducted before the first taxable year for which the accounting method allowed by this Act is elected to be treated as deferred expenses and to be deducted ratably over a 60 month period."
