    "text": "Nuclear Accident Recovery Act - Requires the licensee of a commercial nuclear powerplant at which an accident resulting in significant radioactive contamination of the site has occurred to submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) a cleanup schedule. Requires the NRC to either accept such schedule or order the licensee to comply with a different schedule. Authorizes the NRC to request the Secretary of the Treasury to assess and collect an electricity rate surcharge to cover cleanup costs in excess of the cleanup costs projected on the required schedule submitted by a licensee of a disabled powerplant. Provides for such surcharge to be uniformly applied to all energy generated and sold by such licensee. Requires that the licensee and the regulatory body that regulates its rates be notified upon application and termination of the surcharge. Requires the licensee to identify the purpose and amount of the surcharge on the electric service bills submitted to the licensee's customers and to collect the surcharge and and pay it to the Treasury. Directs the NRC to include in the surcharge an amount calculated to cover any Federal expenditures for research and development that directly reduces cleanup costs. Permits the NRC to waive such requirement under certain circumstances. Directs the Secretary to deposit in a separate trust account in the Treasury all funds collected under this Act, except for reimbursements of Federal research and development expenditures which shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. Requires the Secretary to make disbursements from the trust account to a Federal Reserve bank account in the name of the licensee of a disabled powerplant to cover the cleanup costs on the required schedule. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress annually with respect to any trust account established under this Act. Provides the NRC with the same authority to enforce this Act as it has to enforce the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Gives the U.S. district courts jurisdiction concurrently with the State and Territorial courts over actions to enforce this Act."
