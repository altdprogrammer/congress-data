    "text": "Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to the Environmental Protection Agency (Agency) for specified environmental research, development, and demonstration activities relating to air and water quality, water supply, solid and hazardous wastes, pesticides, radiation, interdisciplinary activities, toxic substances, and energy. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to the Agency's Office of Research and Development for program management and support. Authorizes the Administrator of the Agency to utilize funds authorized under this Act for appropriate scientific and professional review of research and development grant, contract, and cooperative agreement applications. Permits transfers of funds of up to ten percent between categories of activities authorized under this Act, as well as transfers of more than ten percent if the Congress is notified and the appropriate committees do not object. Requires that at least 15 percent of funds appropriated for each activity be obligated and expended for long-term environmental research and development programs. Directs the Administrator to: (1) conduct a study of the use of peer review in research planning by means of a pilot project utilizing peer review projects; and (2) report the results of such study, with recommendations, to the Congress and the Science Advisory Board within one year of the enactment of this Act. Directs the principal research official of the Agency to commission annually several critical reviews of scientific, technical or engineering literature in various fields, using general criteria established and published by the Science Advisory Board. Directs the Administrator, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, to develop and promulgate straightforward procedures to assure that Agency research programs are of verifiable accuracy. Requires that reports of such research work state whether or not the work was performed and reported in accordance with such procedures."
