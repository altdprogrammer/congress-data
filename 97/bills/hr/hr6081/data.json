Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981 to limit to functions performed by 50 or more personnel the application of the requirement that the Secretary report to Congress on the conversion of performance of commercial and industrial type functions from Department personnel to private contractors. Expands the authorization limitation on the Special Defense Acquisition Fund for FY 1984.
