Makes it an infringement of copyright to carry signals comprising the secondary transmission in violation of the regulations of the Tribunal. Subjects sports and syndicated programming to compulsory licensing. Grants the Tribunal greater freedom in establishing and adjusting rates for secondary transmissions. Requires the Tribunal to distribute royalty fees for radio programming based upon the production of original programming. Permits the filing of proceedings before the Tribunal to adjust royalty rates every third year, starting in 1982. Empowers the Tribunal to issue subpoenas for the testimony of witnesses and the production of documents. Eliminates any judicial stay of determinations by the Tribunal. Retains current royalty rates established by the Tribunal concerning compulsory licensing of cable systems' secondary transmissions, pending a review by the Tribunal."
