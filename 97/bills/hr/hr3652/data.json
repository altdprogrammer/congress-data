Authorizes the Secretary, if certain conditions prevail, to require other information from each such hospital relating to: (1) charges for services; (2) mortality or morbidity rates associated with surgery; and (3) other information which will enable patients to compare the risks of being provided the same services in different hospitals. Directs the Secretary and each health systems agency receiving information under this Act to make such information available to the public."
