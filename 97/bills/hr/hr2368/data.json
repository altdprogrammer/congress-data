Sets forth the method of determining such amount and such liability. Requires the liability to be paid as if it were a personal income tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Directs State agencies administering the food stamp program to notify such individuals before February 1 of each calendar year of the amount of coupons allotted to them and to notify the Secretary of the Treasury before March 1 of such amounts and the names and addresses of such individuals. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer sufficient appropriated funds to the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for the collection of assessed funds to the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for the collection of assessed liabilities. Provides for the distribution of such collected amounts to State administrative agencies. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 consistent with provisions of this Act."
