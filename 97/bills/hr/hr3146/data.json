Rept. 97-94) Department of Energy Civilian Research and Development Programs and Projects 1982 Authorization Act - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for the Department of Energy operating expenses for research and development programs with respect to: (1) fossil energy; (2) solar energy; (3) geothermal energy; (4) the Geothermal Resources Development Fund; (5) energy conservation; (6) general science and research; (7) basic energy research; (8) nuclear fission; (9) magnetic fusion; (10) hydropower; (11) electric energy systems and storage; (12) environmental research and development; and (13) advanced isotope separation technology. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for capital equipment for: (1) fossil energy research and development; (2) energy conservation; (3) energy supply, research, and development activities; (4) Tevatron I, Fermilab; (5) the Energy Systems Research Laboratory, Tennessee; (6) the OTEC pilot plant; (7) Impurity Studies Experiment Modification, Tennessee; (8) the Small Community Solar Thermal Power Experiment; (9) the Second 50 MWe Demonstration Power Plant, Heber, Georgia; (10) the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, Michigan; (11) Elmo Bumpy Torus, Tennessee; (12) the Mirror Fusion Test Facility, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, California; (13) the Intersecting Storage Accelerator (ISABELLE), Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York; (14) multi-program general purpose facilities; (15) the Safety Research Experimental Facility, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho; and (16) the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, New Jersey. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for plant and capital equipment for: (1) specified General Plant Projects; (2) specified Accelerator Improvement projects; (3) the Surface Water Containment and Waste Water Treatment Facility, Pennsylvania; (4) the Central Receiver Utility Repowering Projects; (5) the Nuclear Test and Evaluation Facility; (6) Modifications to Reactors; (7) 300 Area Utilities, Washington; (8) Security Facilities, Argonne Laboratory, Illinois; (9) Traffic Safety Improvements, Hanford Engineering Development Laboratory, Washington; (10) Railroad Modification, INEL, Idaho; (11) Modifications and Additions to Environmental Research Facilities; (12) the Argonne Tandem/Linac Accelerator System; (13) Tevatron II, Fermilab; (14) the Solar/Hybrid Electric Power Project; and (15) the Development Module. Repeals the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor Demonstration Program. Directs the Secretary of Energy to report to appropriate Congressional committees on a plan for the termination of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor Project. Authorizes appropriations for: (1) such termination plan; and (2) refined conceptual design activities for a liquid metal fast breeder Large Development Plant. Requires that the Federal share of plant and capital equipment construction projects be funded exclusively from an account separate from operating expenses, except in the case of a nuclear fission construction project for which funds are authorized under this Act. Permits the use of operating expenses for: (1) any construction project with a total estimated Federal cost of $500,000 or less; (2) the conceptual design of any project; (3) individual research and development or testing components which are not an integral part of a basic facility or construction project; (4) experimental test equipment not used for long-term research and development; and (5) solar heating and cooling demonstrations. Specifies procedures for initiating major construction projects in advance of the next annual budget cycle where it is in the national interest to do so. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a Research and Development Construction and Facilities Office to provide technical and management facility design and construction services for the Department of Energy. Authorizes a specified amount within departmental administration for the establishment of such office. Prohibits the use of any funds authorized under this Act for the release of any radioactive contaminated water into the Susquehanna River or its watershed. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize commercial or remedial action activities."
