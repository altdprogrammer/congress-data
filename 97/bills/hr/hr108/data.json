    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-01-05", 
    "text": "Year End Spending Control Act - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to apportion appropriations to Federal agencies for fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984 in a manner which insures that no more than 20 percent of the total appropriations available to an agency in a fiscal year may be obligated during the last two months of that year. Authorizes the Director to waive such a spending limitation upon determining that it would seriously disrupt an agency program or operation, if the Director reports on such waiver to Congress before the agency violates such limitation. Requires the Director to report to Congress concerning violations of spending limitations, the results and impact of this Act on procurement and apportionment processes, and recommendations on continuing the spending limitations. Exempts reserves established to comply with a spending limitation under this Act from reporting requirements of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Directs an agency to consider an employee's compliance with agency rules and procedures applicable to year-end expenditure practices when: (1) evaluating the performance of a member of the Senior Executive Service; and (2) determining any pay increase for a supervisor or manager under the merit pay system."
