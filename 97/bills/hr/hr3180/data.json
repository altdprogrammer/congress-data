    "text": "Agricultural Act of 1981 - Title I: Dairy and Soybean Programs - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to lower the minimum price support for milk from 75 percent to 70 percent of parity, with allowance to drop even below the minimum if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the Commodity Credit Corporation has accumulated excessive quantities of milk or milk products. Sets the support price effective on October 1, 1981, at a minimum $13.10 per hundredweight of milk containing 3.67 percent milkfat. Repeals the prohibition against requiring a soybean acreage set-aside as a condition of eligibility for price support for any other commodity. Extends through 1985 the Corporation's authority to transfer dairy products to the military and veterans hospitals. Title II: Wheat - Suspends application of existing crop production loan level, established price, acreage allotment, set-aside and marketing quota provisions of such Act to the 1982 through 1985 crops of wheat. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans and purchases available to producers of such crops at any level the Secretary determines appropriate taking into consideration the cost of production, supply and demand conditions, and world prices. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a land-diversion program in lieu of the present set-aside program, and require participation as a condition of eligibility for loans and purchases. Permits devotion of diverted acreage to wildlife food plots or habitats. Title III: Feed Grains - Suspends application of existing crop production loan level, established price, acreage allotment, set-aside, and marketing quota provisions of such Act to the 1982 through 1985 crops of feed grains. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans and purchases available to feed grains producers at any level the Secretary determines appropriate taking into consideration specified factors. Authorizes the conducting of a land-diversion program in lieu of the present set-aside program along lines similar to those prescribed for wheat under title II of this Act. Title IV: Upland Cotton - Suspends application of existing price support, marketing quota, base acreage allotment, and related provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to the 1982 through 1985 crops of upland cotton. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to: (1) extend the nonrecourse loan program through 1985; (2) revise the standard for determining cotton loan levels (from Strict Middling one and one-sixteenth inch to Middling one and three-thirty seconds inch cotton C.I.F. Northern Europe); (3) repeal existing prevented planting and disaster payment authority, along with the national acreage and set-aside programs; and (4) retain the current land diversion (and land diversion payment) program along lines similar to those prescribed for wheat and feed grains under titles II and III of this Act. Extends through July 31, 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation's present authority to sell upland cotton at not less than 115 percent of the loan rate. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to extend through 1985 the present rules governing skiprow practices. Title V: Rice - Suspends application of existing acreage allotment and marketing quota provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to the 1982 through 1985 crops of rice. Authorizes the Secretary to make loans and purchases available to rice producers at any level the Secretary determines appropriate taking into consideration specified factors (but lets stand, without extending, current authorities relating to established prices). Authorizes the conduct of a land-diversion program (while not suspending or repealing current authority to conduct a set-aside program) along the lines prescribed for wheat, feed grains, and upland cotton under titles II, III, and IV of this Act. Title VI: Peanuts - Suspends application of specified acreage allotment and marketing quota provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to the 1982 through 1985 crops of peanuts. Establishes national poundage quotas for the 1982 through 1985 marketing years. Makes the farm base production poundage for each of such years the same as the poundage for 1981. Changes the formula for the determination of farm poundage quotas. Permits the sale, lease, or other transfer of farm base production poundage, from farm to farm, subject to specified conditions, including transfer to a farm in another county. Revises formulae for the determination of violations subject to marketing penalties. Permits handlers to contract with producers for purchase of additional peanuts (in excess of quota peanuts) for domestic edible use. Revises the formulae for the computation of the purchase price of additional peanuts. Suspends the exemption from marketing penalties of farms whose peanut acreage is one acre or less. Changes the interest rate on marketing penalties from six percent per annum (of the penalty amount) to 120 percent per annum of the interest rate charged the Commodity Credit Corporation by the Treasury of the United States on the date such penalty became due. Declares the facts constituting the basis for determining liability for or amount of any such penalty to be final and conclusive and not reviewable. Extends the existing price support program for peanuts through the 1985 crop. Title VII: Grain Reserves - Removes specified percentage limitations to give the Secretary complete discretion, with respect to terms and conditions of producer-held grain reserve storage loans, to determine at what market price levels such producers are to be encouraged or required to redeem and market stored wheat and feed grains or repay loans before the maturity dates. Removes specified limitations on the number of bushels the Secretary may determine as appropriate for the storage program to promote the orderly marketing of such commodities. Removes the exemption for corn sold for alcohol-as-fuel production from the price restrictions on Commodity Credit Corporation sales of feed grain stocks.

Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to change from mandatory to discretionary the Secretary's authority to make farm storage facility loans. Title VIII: Wool and Mohair - Amends the National Wool Act to set the support price of shorn wool at a percentage of (currently 85 percent) an amount calculated according to a specified formula that will be not more than 90 percent nor less than 60 percent. Allows the Secretary to set the support price at less than 60 percent of such amount if such lower level is determined to be appropriate because of exceptional circumstances involving the cost or availability of shorn wool. Removes existing limits on total price support payments at any one time. Repeals the current provision for reimbursement of the Commodity Credit Corporation for the making of price support payments. Title IX: General and Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to repeal the requirement that the Secretary make Soil Conservation Act payments even if the entitled recipient dies, becomes incompetent, disappears, or is succeeded by another who completes the prescribed performance. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to extend through 1985 the current Commodity Credit Corporation sales price restrictions for wheat and feed grains. Amends the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 to repeal the domestic disaster emergency feed program. Title X: Public Law 480 - Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480 - Food for Peace program) to extend from December 31, 1981, through December 31, 1985, the authority for assistance programs and agreements to finance sales under such Act. Repeals the exclusion from \"friendly country\" status of any country or area dominated by a Communist government where commodity sales are for foreign currencies only. Limits to sales under agreements entered into before January 1, 1972, any sales for foreign currencies whose foreign currency proceeds the President is authorized to use for bond payments and other specified purposes. Increases from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 the maximum amount available in any fiscal year for emergency or extraordinary relief other than food relief. Repeals: (1) Commodity Credit Corporation authority to finance ocean freight charges where such charges are higher than usual by reason of a requirement that the commodities involved be transported by United States-flag vessels; (2) the current requirement that the President take into consideration specified self-help measures a developing country is undertaking before entering into agreements with it for the sale of U.S. agricultural commodities; and (3) the ceiling on the annual aggregate dollar amount of all agreements to sell U.S. agricultural commodities for foreign currencies or long-term dollar-credit. Restricts to purchases of food commodities from private stocks the requirement of public bids for financial assistance under such Act. Removes the ceiling from the authorization of appropriations to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for the costs of assistance programs. Allows representatives of the distilled spirits industry to use foreign currencies in market development activities intended to expand export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities. Changes from April 1 to July 1 the due date of the President's annual report to Congress on activities carried out under such Act. Title XI: Rural Development and Conservation - Reaffirms that agricultural land is an important natural resource. Encourages the Secretary to provide technical assistance to States and localities developing programs which emphasize the importance of such land. Authorizes the use of grants, contracts, and other such means for such purposes. Reaffirms Congressional policy to promote soil and water conservation. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress by December 31, 1981 on a comprehensive soil and water conservation policy. Title XII: Research, Extension, and Teaching in the Food and Agricultural Sciences - Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to revise the Congressional findings and purposes of such Act to give greater emphasis to the role of State agricultural extension services in research and teaching in the food and agricultural sciences. Extends from five to ten years the term of the Joint Council on Food and Agricultural Sciences. Sets the membership of the Joint Council at not less than 25 representatives of organizations or agencies conducting research, extension, or teaching programs. Establishes three-year, staggered terms for such members. Changes from December 31 to June 30 the due date for the Joint Council's annual report to the Secretary. Exempts the Joint Council from coverage by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Extends from five to ten years the term of the National Agricultural Research and Extension Users Advisory Board. Increases membership from 21 to 25, serving staggered terms.

Specifies as part of the staff of five full-time professionals assisting the Joint Council and the Users Advisory Board: (1) an executive secretary for each entity; and (2) an executive director to serve both. Authorizes the granting of special five-year facilities grants to research foundations established by land-grant colleges and universities.
