Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to provide that an adjustment in the rate of pay for congressmen during any Congress shall not take effect until the beginning of the next Congress. Prohibits the pay rate of congressional employees from being in excess of the pay rate of congressmen. Requires the President to submit recommendations for pay rates within the first 15 days of January after receipt of the report and recommendations of the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries. Removes the requirement that such recommendation be included in the submission of the budget."
