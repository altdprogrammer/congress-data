    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Florida Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1982 - Provides for the approval of prior transfers of lands and the extinguishment of claims and aboriginal title to lands involving the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Makes such approval contingent upon the publication by the Secretary of the Interior of findings that the State of Florida has: (1) paid settlement funds to the tribe; (2) executed a lease agreement with the tribe; (3) enacted appropriate legislation to carry out specified commitments under its settlement agreement with the tribe; and (4) given a waiver specified in such settlement agreement. Exempts the leasehold granted the tribe under the lease agreement from all State and local taxes. Treats the lands leased to the tribe under the lease agreement as if such lands constituted a federally recognized Indian reservation solely for purposes of determining eligibility of the tribe and its members for Federal assistance. Permits the State of Florida to take or diminish any interest granted the tribe under the lease agreement only for a public purpose and upon payment of just compensation, but without approval of Congress or any executive officer of the United States. Directs the Secretary to accept the transfer to the United States, to be held in trust for the use and benefit of the tribe, of specified lands authorized to be conveyed to the tribe by specified Florida statutes. Provides that the State of Florida shall continue to have civil and criminal jurisdiction over such lands unless the State retrocedes such jurisdiction in whole or part. Subjects such transfer of lands to all existing leases, easements, and rights-of-way, and all the rights, easements, and reservations in favor of the South Florida Water Management District. Declares that any such transfer shall not confer upon the tribe, or upon the lands within the reservation, any additional water rights. Limits actions to contest the constitutionality of this Act. Revokes specified provisions of this Act in the event the settlement agreement between the tribe and the State of Florida is ever invalidated."
