    "text": "Intelligence Identities Protection Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for whoever, having had authorized access to classified information, intentionally discloses information that identifies a covert agent, knowing that the information so identifies such individual and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such individual's intelligence relationship to the United States. Establishes criminal penalties for whoever, having had authorized access to classified information, learns the identity of a covert agent and intentionally discloses such information, knowing that the information so identifies such agent and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such agent's relationship to the United States. Makes it a defense to such crimes that before the commission of the offense the United States had publicly acknowledged or revealed the intelligence relationship of the individual to the United States. Provides that no person other than the person committing such offense shall be subject to prosecution, except with respect to those acting in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents with intent to impair U.S. intelligence activities. Stipulates that it shall not be an offense to transmit such information directly to the Congressional intelligence committees. Directs the President to establish procedures to ensure that any employee of an intelligence agency or any member of the armed forces assigned to an intelligence agency or to intelligence duties whose identity is classified information is afforded all appropriate assistance to conceal his identity."
