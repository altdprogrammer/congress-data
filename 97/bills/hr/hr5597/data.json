Requires all vehicle manufacturers producing more than 50,000 motor vehicles for sale in the United States to provide information to the Secretary of Transportation for the purpose of administering this requirement. Authorizes the imposition of import restrictions on manufacturers violating such standards. Title II: Unfair and Deceptive Practices by Vehicle Manufacturers - Defines as an unfair method of competition and deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act the refusal of any vehicle manufacturer to determine whether parts produced in the United States by a parts manufacturer satisfy reasonable replacement part standards established by the vehicle manufacturer. Grants the Federal Trade Commission rulemaking authority to administer this title."
