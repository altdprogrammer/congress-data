Requires the NRC to make an award of all or part of the costs of participation in an NRC proceeding to an individual who applies for such an award and who: (1) presents an interest which is not adequately presented by other participants in the proceeding and which contributes substantially to the full and fair consideration of a relevant issue; (2) does not have the resources to participate effectively in the proceeding; and (3) has not improperly harrassed any participant, acted in bad faith, or sought to participate in order to delay or obstruct the proceeding. Authorizes advance or interim awards where an eligible person would be unable to participate in an NRC proceeding without such award. Permits the NRC to require consolidation of duplicative presentations, select representatives to participate, offer limited compensation, or jointly compensate persons representing the same or related viewpoints. Subjects NRC decisions with respect to such awards to judicial review."
