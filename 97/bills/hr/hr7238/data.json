    "text": "Criminal Justice Construction Reform Act - Title I: Findings and Definitions - Sets forth definitions and findings. Defines \"criminal justice facilities\" to include court, law enforcement, juvenile, correctional, and other facilities used for any criminal justice purpose. Title II: Grants for the Construction and Modernization of Criminal Justice Facilities - Authorizes the Administrator of the Criminal Justice Facilities Administration (established under title III) to make grants to States for the construction and modernization of criminal justice facilities during FY 1983 through 1988. Apportions appropriations among States on the basis of population and the volume and expenditure of criminal justice activities. Sets aside another portion of such sums appropriated for demonstration grants to test the applicability of advanced practices on the design, construction, and modernization of facilities. Requires any State desiring to receive such funding to submit a seven-year State plan. Directs the Administrator to operate a criminal justice facilities information clearinghouse. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay State and local governments an interest subsidy for criminal facility construction bonds which reduce the cost of such bonds to not more than five percent interest. Title III: Administration Provisions - Establishes the Criminal Justice Facilities Administration within the Department of Justice, headed by an Administrator appointed by the President. Charges the Administrator with carrying out this Act and submitting to the President for transmittal to Congress a report at least once per year. Sets at 75 percent the Federal share of the cost of a State plan approved under this Act. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the Administrator of the General Services Administration to donate surplus property to any State for construction and modernization of criminal justice facilities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1988."
