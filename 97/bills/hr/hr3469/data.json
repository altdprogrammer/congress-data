    "text": "Energy and Emergency Assistance Block Grant Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to a State to be used to provide home energy and emergency assistance to low-income individuals. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1985. Requires that payments to a State for any fiscal year be expended in such fiscal year or in the succeeding fiscal year. Permits a State to transfer up to ten percent of its allotted funds for support of health services, health promotion, disease prevention activities, or social services. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce a State's allotment under this Act if such state fails to provide energy and emergency assistance to an Indian tribe eligible for such assistance under this Act. Requires the chief executive officer of a State to report on the intended use of grants received under this Act. Authorizes a State to use such amounts as are necessary to pay administrative costs. Prohibits the use of grants under this Act for the purchase or improvement of land or for the purchase, construction, or permanent improvement of any building or facility except under specified circumstances. Requires a State to report to the Secretary on its activities and audit its expenditures under this Act for each fiscal year. Requires a State to repay to the United States any amounts not expended in accordance with this Act, or authorizes the Secretary to offset such amounts against future grants to such State. Prohibits exclusion from participation in or denial of benefits from any program or activity funded under this Act on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or a handicap. Repeals: (1) specified provisions of part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act; (2) the Home Energy Assistance Act of 1980; and (3) the Emergency Energy Conservation Services program established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964."
