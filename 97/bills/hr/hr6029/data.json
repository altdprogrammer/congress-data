Prohibits such exchange unless Indiana: (1) transfers to the Secretary all right, title, and interest in the land offered for exchange; and (2) enters into a recordable agreement providing that the State will not use, or permit the use, of land it receives for other than the established use of the Lakeshore, will not transfer any right, title, or interest in, or control over such land to any person other than the Secretary, and will permit access to such land by the Secretary. Includes in such agreement a reversionary interest to the United States if the State fails to comply with certain provisions of this Act."
