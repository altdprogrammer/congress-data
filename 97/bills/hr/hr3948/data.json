    "text": "Voting Rights Act Amendments Act of 1981 - Amends the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to prohibit any State from enacting or seeking to administer any voting practice different from that in effect on the date of enactment, for the purpose of or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote. Extends indefinitely the administrative preclearance requirements, but permits a State or local government to bail out from such provisions upon a showing to a Federal court that: (1) it has not discriminated for ten years prior to its filing; (2) it has made all required submissions to the Department of Justice; (3) the Attorney General has not successfully interposed a substantial objection to any such submission; and (4) it has engaged in constructive efforts to involve voters in the election process. Eliminates the three-judge court for the District of Columbia as the forum for bailout petitions. Authorizes the Federal court granting bail out to retain jurisdiction for a period of five years to reopen the action. Permits the Attorney General or an aggrieved party to move to reopen the action on the grounds that the State or local government has engaged in conduct which would have precluded issuance of a declaratory judgment, had such conduct occurred during the ten preceding years. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action in Federal court for implementation of mandatory preclearance whenever a pattern or practice of voting rights denial has occurred. Permits the Attorney General to intervene in any civil action brought by a person to protect rights under this title upon certification that the case is of general importance."
