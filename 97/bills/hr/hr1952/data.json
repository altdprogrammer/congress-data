    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Amends the Sikes Act to include among required provisions of cooperative plans for conservation programs on military reservations specific habitat improvement projects and related activities and adequate protection for species of fish, wildlife, and plants considered threatened or endangered. Provides that such cooperative plans shall not be deemed to be, or treated as, cooperative agreements to which the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 applies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985 to the Secretaries of Defense and Interior for conservation programs on military reservations, including the enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and the development of public recreation and other facilities. Authorizes the Secretaries of Defense and Interior to use their authority under other conservation or rehabilitation laws to carry out conservation programs on military reservations under such Act. Includes among the required conservation and rehabilitation programs on public lands under such Act specific habitat improvement projects and related activities and adequate protection for species of plants (as well as of fish and wildlife) considered threatened or endangered. Provides that cooperative agreements entered into by State agencies for such conservation programs on public lands shall not be deemed to be, or treated as, cooperative agreements to which the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 applies. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985 to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior for conservation programs on public lands. Authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to: (1) use their authority under other conservation or rehabilitation laws to carry out such conservation programs on public lands; and (2) make purchases and contracts for property and services from, or provide assistance to, State agencies to implement conservation projects and programs on or for public lands under such Act without regard to specified advertising and competitive bidding requirements under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. Limits such contract authority to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts. Amends the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 to delete the requirement that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study on alternative methods of funding State conservation plans for nongame fish and wildlife be funded out of funds available for the administration of such Act. Extends the deadline for completion of the study to December 31, 1984. Amends the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to undercover operations to detect and prosecute wildlife crimes, to: (1) direct the advance of funds which may be deposited in banks; (2) pay for information, rewards, or evidence concerning such crimes; and (3) establish or acquire proprietary corporations or business entities as part of an undercover operation and use the proceeds from such businesses to offset operational expenses. Requires that the proceeds left at the conclusion of each such operation be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Makes technical and conforming amendment to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act."
