    "text": "Program Review Act of 1981 - Requires certain agencies to submit a program review report to the Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate every eight years according to a specified schedule. Directs each agency to conduct hearings to obtain public comments on its programs and to submit such report by April 1 of the assigned year. Requires a program review report to contain specified information on each program administered by the agency, including: (1) budget information; (2) a description of the purposes, results, objectives, benefits, and paperwork requirements of each program; (3) an assessment of the cost effectiveness of the program compared to alternatives; and (4) recommended changes in law to modify or terminate such program or agency. Directs each Committee, by May 1, to refer each program review report to the legislative committees having jurisdiction over programs identified in the report and to specify which committee shall review which programs. Requires each legislative committee, by September 15, to evaluate the program review report and to report a resolution that modifies, terminates, or continues each program under its jurisdiction. Sets forth procedures for the consideration of such a resolution by the House and the Senate. Deletes any section of a resolution that continues a program. Directs the House and Senate to consider any legislation modifying or terminating such program as a substitute measure for the deleted section if such legislation is sponsored by not less than a majority of the Members of the respective House by September 20. Requires each Committee, by October 1, to report a simple resolution specifying the sequence in which reported program review resolutions will be considered in each House. Requires that each House complete action on all program review resolutions by November 15. Bars congressional action on legislation relationg to the programs or agencies included in program review reports or resolution if the specified deadlines are not met. Prohibits either House from adjourning sine die until all program review resolutions and substitute measures are finally approved or disapproved."
