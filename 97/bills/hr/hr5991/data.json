    "text": "National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1982 and 1983 - Title I: Authorization of Funds for Fiscal Year 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for FY 1982 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth, and ocean sciences; (5) ocean drilling programs; (6) U.S. Antarctic Program; (7) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (8) cross- directorate programs; (9) program development and management; (10) science and engineering education; and (11) modernization of research equipment and facilities. Limits the amount of authorizations which may be expended for consultation and for expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Title II: Authorization of Funds for Fiscal Year 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth, and ocean sciences; (5) ocean drilling programs; (6) U.S. Antarctic Program; (7) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (8) program development and management; and (9) science and engineering education. Specifies amounts for research to aid the handicapped, the National Research Opportunity Grant Program, and research instrumentation. Prohibits the use of funds for U.S. support of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna, Austria if the President determines that participation is contrary to national security interests. Limits the amount of authorizations which may be expended for consultation and for expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Title III: Availability of Funds and Other Functions - Requires the ratio of individual program appropriations to total appropriations be the same as the ratio of individual program authorizations to total authorizations. Permits the transfer of funds among categories exceeding ten percent of the authorized amount of a category if the chairmen of the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources each write the Director of the Foundation that there is no objection to the transfer or 30 days have passed after such committees were notified of the proposed transfer. Repeals the requirement that the Director establish a Resource Center for Science and Engineering at an educational institution enrolling a substantial number of minority and/or low-income students. Title IV: Directorate for Science and Engineering Education - Names the Directorate for Science and Engineering Education as a permanent organizational entity of the Foundation. Requires that the appropriate committees of Congress be given 30 days notice of any proposed changes in the functions or organization of the Directorate."
