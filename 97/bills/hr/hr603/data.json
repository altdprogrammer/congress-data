    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the treatment of public utility property to prohibit any taxpaying utility from using the normalization method of accounting if, for rate-making purposes or for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, it employs any adjustment that is inconsistent with the existing requirements for users of such accounting method. States that an adjustment shall be considered inconsistent with such requirements: (1) if such adjustment is based on estimates or projections of the taxpayer's regulated tax expense, regulated depreciation expense, rate base used for ratemaking purposes, or its tax deferral reserve that are not consistent with observed relationships among such items; or (2) if such adjustment otherwise is based on estimates or projections that do not employ consistent assumptions or bases for projection. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt rules defining other adjustments that are not consistent with such requirements. Revises the formula for determination of the allowability of an investment tax credit on certain depreciable public utility property."
