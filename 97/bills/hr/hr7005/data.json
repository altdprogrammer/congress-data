Requires such mixtures to be labeled as a mixture, with each seed component listed in order of predominance. Requires that only the month and year of the oldest germination test be shown for such mixtures. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to extend the five month period between test and shipment dates if the seed will keep its germination qualities over a longer period of time. Eliminates import requirements respecting pure-live seed and weed contamination testing."
