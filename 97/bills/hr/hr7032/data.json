    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to abolish the defense of insanity. Provides that insanity at the time of an offense will not negate the mental state or condition required by law to convict a defendant of an offense, provided that the defendant possessed the intellectual capacity to understand the nature of the offense. Places upon the defendant the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the lack of intellectual capacity. Allows the court to commit a convicted defendant to an appropriate psychiatric or medical institution if the defendant's psychiatric condition warrants such treatment. Permits the defendant to be institutionalized: (1) until the expiration of the sentence imposed; or (2) until medical treatment is no longer necessary, at which time he or she shall serve the remainder of the sentence in prison."
