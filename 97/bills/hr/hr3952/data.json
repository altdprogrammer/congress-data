    "text": "Freedom of Education Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income tax credit for 100 percent of the tuition paid for the elementary, secondary, college, or post-secondary vocational education of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependents. Requires the individual for whom the tuition tax credit is allowed by this Act to be a full-time student during any four months of the calendar year. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school. Specifies that the granting of a tax credit to a student due to his enrollment in any educational institution shall not be considered as Federal-assistance to such institution. Prohibits any Federal court from considering the constitutionality of this Act."
