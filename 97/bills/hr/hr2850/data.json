States that such fund should be available to help such countries develop regions for permanent resettlement of refugees. Authorizes appropriations to pay the authorized U.S. contribution to such fund. Directs the President to encourage multilateral development banks to establish similar funds to aid in the settlement of such refugees in the countries in which they first obtain asylum."
