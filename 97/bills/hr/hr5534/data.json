Directs the Secretary to: (1) begin such payments upon being notified that the mortgage is in default; and (2) continue such payments for not more than 36 months until the mortgagor's family income exceeds 80 percent of its average income for the two tax years preceding such payments. Disqualifies any mortgagor whose family income for such period exceeds $30,000. Provides for the repayment of such assistance by the mortgagor. Prohibits assistance payments to a mortgagor in a State which does not collect and analyze unemployment data and submit such data and analysis to the Secretary semiannually. Requires the Secretary to designate areas where assistance may be provided under this Act."
