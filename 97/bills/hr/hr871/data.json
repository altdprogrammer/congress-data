    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to 15 years for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to ten to 30 years for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Requires the court to state in writing its reasons for not imposing an additional sentence. Permits such a defendant to be treated as a \"special offender\" for the purpose of the current procedures authorizing increased penalties for such offenders."
