    "text": "Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under the definition of \"State\" for purposes of the Act. Includes among the functions of the Administration on Aging the coordination of Federal activities with respect to the collection, preparation, and dissemination of information relevant to older individuals. Eliminates the National Information and Resource Clearinghouse for the Aged. Sets March 31, 1982, as the deadline for a study by the Federal Council on Aging evaluating programs for older Americans. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Council through fiscal year 1983. Eliminates outdated provisions relating to a report on legal services programs. Repeals a provision that a Congressional declaration of policy respecting \"Insular Areas\" not apply to the administration of programs for older Americans. Extends through fiscal year 1983 the authorization of appropriations for grants for State and community programs on aging (relating to social services and to congregate and home delivered nutrition services). Continues through fiscal year 1983 formulas for allotments to States and determination of the Federal share of costs of such programs. Changes (from a minimum of 50 percent) to \"an adequate proportion\" that portion of the amount of social service grant funds which area plans must assure will be expended for access to services, in-home services, and legal services. Requires that State plans provide that each nutrition service project will be available not only to individuals aged 60 or older and their spouses but also to handicapped or disabled individuals under 60 years of age residing in senior citizen centers where congregate nutrition services are provided. Requires that such plans give primary consideration to congregate nutrition services, but allows area agencies to award funds to organizations for home nutrition services without requiring that such organizations also provide congregate services. Permits charges for access to meals for the elderly where appropriate. Repeals a limitation on the use of nutrition services funds for supportive services. Extends through fiscal year 1983: (1) the 30 cents per meal minimum level of assistance under the program of donation of surplus agricultural commodities to nutrition services for the elderly grant or contract recipients; and (2) the requirement that the Secretary of Agriculture purchase high protein foods, meat, and meat alternates for such purpose. Directs the Commissioner of the Administration on Aging to consult with minority aging organizations and include the status of meeting the manpower needs of the minority elderly in reports on existing and future personnel needs. Includes weatherization improvement and energy efficiency among the special housing needs of older individuals for which special consideration will be given in awarding project grants and contracts. Provides that a report on special projects in comprehensive long-term care be included in the annual report on programs for older Americans. Extends through fiscal year 1983 the authorization of appropriations for training, research, and discretionary projects and programs in the field of aging. Includes the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in: (1) provisions for distribution of assistance under such Act; and (2) in the definition of \"State\" for purposes of the Older American Community Service Employment Programs. Includes weatherization activities among community services for purposes of such programs. Extends through fiscal year 1983 the authorization of appropriations for such programs. Extends through fiscal year 1983 the authorization of appropriations for grants for Indian tribes for elderly services, including multipurpose senior centers. Sets forth technical and conforming amendments."
