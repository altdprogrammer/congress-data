Stipulates that the additional mandatory penalty shall not apply if the underlying felony consists solely of the possession, transportation, or sale of a firearm. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to two years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to five years for a second offender (currently, two to 25 years for a second or subsequent offender). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose the additional sentence concurrently with the sentence imposed for the felony. Prohibits the granting of parole to an offender."
