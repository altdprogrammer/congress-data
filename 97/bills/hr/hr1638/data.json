    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries with amendment, H. Rept. 97-276) Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 - Repeals provisions of Federal law prohibiting commerce in wildlife and fish (the Lacey and Black Bass Acts). Sets forth prohibitions against trade in any fish or wildlife taken or possessed in violation of Federal, Indian tribal, State, or foreign law. Adds a new prohibition against trade in plants which are subject to State conservation of species laws. Increases the maximum civil penalties for violations to $10,000 (currently $5,000 under the Lacey Act). Provides that a lesser civil penalty imposed by the underlying State or other law for the transportation or receipt of wildlife shall apply whenever the Federal violation involves wildlife valued at under $350. Establishes felony penalties of a $20,000 fine and/or five years' imprisonment for knowing violations of this Act. Eliminates the specific intent requirement. Retains the current misdemeanor penalties ($10,000 fine and/or up to one year imprisonment) for lesser offenses. Subjects all fish, wildlife, or plants traded in violation of this Act to forfeiture to the United States on a strict liability basis. Makes applicable certain forfeiture provisions of the customs laws. Permits any person authorized to enforce this Act to carry firearms, make an arrest without a warrant on reasonable grounds, execute and serve warrants, detain and inspect a vehicle or package upon entering or prior to leaving the United States, or hold a seized item pending the disposition of proceedings. Directs that, beginning in fiscal year 1983, the Secretaries of the Interior, the Treasury, or Commerce shall pay rewards to persons who furnish information leading to a conviction, assessment, or forfeiture for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to promulgate jointly regulations to implement the labeling requirements of this Act (governing packages containing fish or wildlife in interstate or foreign commerce) in accordance with existing commercial practices. Transfers from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of the Interior the authority to prescribe requirements and issue permits for the importation of wild animals and birds under humane and healthful conditions. Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to direct the payment of rewards for information leading to a conviction, assessment or forfeiture (currently, such payments are discretionary)."
