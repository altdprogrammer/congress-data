    "text": "Title I - Sports Violence Arbitration Act of 1981 - Requires the management and player representatives of each league of professional sports clubs (including baseball, football, hockey, and soccer) to establish an arbitration system for the settlement of grievances resulting from the use of excessive physical force during sports events. Permits any player or sports club to bring an action before the board. Authorizes arbitration orders to include awards of compensation to be paid by the club employing the offending player and the imposition of disciplinary actions. Authorizes appeal of arbitration orders to the U.S. courts of appeals. Directs the National Labor Relations Board to establish recommended rules and procedures governing the arbitration proceedings. Title II - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for any professional sports player who knowingly uses excessive physical force and causes a risk of significant bodily injury to another person involved in the sports event."
