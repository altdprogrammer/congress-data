Provides, however, that if the seller and buyer apply to the Commission, the Commission may permit such agreements if it finds: (1) that such agreements were made before November 29, 1982; (2) that, if the purchaser is a natural gas company, such contractual agreements will not cause unreasonable rates; and (3) that permitting such contractual arrangements is necessary to prevent a default by seller on a loan or debt in effect on November 29, 1982, or permitting such contractual arrangements is necessary to prevent a taking, without fair compensation, of seller's property. Prohibits cost passthroughs by an interstate pipeline for imprudent actions on the part of the pipeline."
