    "text": "Indoor Air Pollution Research Act of 1982 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish and carry out a comprehensive indoor air pollution research and development program. Requires that such program: (1) broaden understanding and coordinate Federal, State, local, and private efforts; (2) emphasize data gathering and information transfer on all aspects of the problem (defines \"indoor environment\" to include residences and other non-manufacturing public and private buildings); and (3) be considered an integral part of the EPA's general responsibility to protect human health and welfare from air pollutants. Establishes, to assist the Administrator in the administration of such program: (1) a Committee on Indoor Air Quality representing specified Federal agencies; and (2) an advisory group of representatives of industry, the scientific community, and public interest organizations. Sets forth requirements for the principal objectives and particular emphases of such program. Requires the Administrator to maintain constant communication with appropriate State and local officials and interested parties in the private sector and to work with appropriate industry representatives to develop industrywide voluntary standards for residential buildings to aid in indoor air pollution prevention or abatement. Directs the Administrator to submit reports to Congress at specified intervals containing certain information relating to such program. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such program for FY 1983 and FY 1984."
