Urges the President to discuss arranging with Japan medium-term supply, purchase, and storage commitments for farm produce. Title II: Discussions and Studies Regarding United States-Japan Relations - Establishes the Japan-United States Interparliamentary Group to meet annually to discuss common problems in the interest of relations between the United States and Japan. Requires the U.S. members of the Group to report annually to Congress. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to grant funds for fiscal years 1983-1986 to the Japan-United States Trade Study Group, a voluntary group of businessmen and government officials formed to resolve trade problems and misunderstandings between the two countries. Authorizes the Secretary to grant funds to similar trade study groups for the United States, and other countries. Directs the U.S. Comptroller General to submit to Congress a study on recent and current trends in Japanese productivity in selected basic and high technology industries. Directs the Secretary of Energy to report annually to Congress on the comparative energy efficiency between the United States and Japan for at least 20 significant industrial processes during a specified five year period. Title III: Amendments to, and Actions under, Existing Law for Purposes of Improving Japan-United States Relations - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to authorize the President to export oil to Japan during the effective period of a bilateral agreement: (1) which provides for the sale to or exchange with the United States by Japan of an equal amount of crude oil; and (2) between the United States and Japan which coordinates nonpetroleum energy research and development projects. Makes the Export Administration Act of 1979 not applicable to coal specified in bilateral coal agreements which guaranteed access to foreign markets and guaranteed supply by the United States. Urges the President to negotiate a trade agreement with Japan, the European Economic Community, and other countries providing for: (1) a mutual substantial reduction in, or elimination of, duties on semi-conductors and integrated circuits; and (2) the mutual reduction or elimination of nontariff barriers to trade in semi-conductors, integrated circuits, and related high technology electronic products. Amends the Federal provisions for developing the Senior Executive Service to encourage sabbaticals for personnel to study foreign countries and foreign languages.
