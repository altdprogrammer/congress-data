    "text": "Steelhead Trout Protection Act - Declares that State laws and regulations prohibiting, restricting, or regulating the taking, possession, transportation, or sale of steelhead trout shall apply to and be enforceable against Indians and Indian tribes at places within such State both within and without the boundaries of an Indian reservation in the same manner and to the same extent as such laws and regulations apply to other persons. Allows a State to establish by written agreement with an Indian tribe different laws or regulations as to the taking and possession of steelhead trout by Indian tribal members on an Indian reservation. Permits an Indian tribe to require (in addition to State license requirements) licenses and fees for fishing for steelhead trout on the tribe's Indian trust land or in waters within the tribe's reservation boundaries. Prohibits a State from requiring a license or fee from a member of an Indian tribe for such fishing or for fishing at usual and accustomed fishing grounds of such tribe. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to enforce such licensing requirements of Indian tribes. Authorizes tribal enforcement personnel to make arrests and seizures relating to violations of such requirements. Sets forth procedures and penalties relating to such violations. Amends the Black Bass Act to include steelhead trout legally taken in the Columbia River between the States of Washington and Oregon under the coverage of such Act. Confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Court of Claims over all causes of action seeking compensation for an alleged taking of Indian treaty rights arising under or growing out of this Act. Sets forth procedures for such claims."
