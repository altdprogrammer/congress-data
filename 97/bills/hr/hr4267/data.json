    "text": "Meat Inspection, Grading, and Labeling Act of 1981 - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct tests on imported carcasses and meat or meat food products capable of consumption as human food at the point of entry into the United States to determine if such products contain any prohibited substance under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend such tests for certain packaged foods and label such foods as untested. Allows adulterated meat food products to be imported into the United States if such products are labeled as condemned and are to be used as fertilizers or for other similar purposes. Requires the Secretary to prescribe assessments on imported meat food products necessary to cover the costs of inspections, certifications, testing, and labeling. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend or revoke the privilege of any person or plant to export such products to the United States for failure to pay such assessments. Directs the Secretary to establish a system for the labeling of meat food products at the time of inspection to indicate whether such products are domestic or imported. Requires imported labeling to indicate the country of origin. Provides that any person other than the ultimate consumer who breaks a container of meat food products shall affix such labeling as required by regulations issued by the Secretary. Amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to require the inspection and certification of agricultural products shipped or received in interstate commerce. Directs the Secretary to establish and carry out a system for grading the quality of imported meat food products."
