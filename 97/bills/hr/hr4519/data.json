    "text": "Maritime Dry Bulk Trade Act - Directs the Secretary in the Department in which the Maritime Administration is operating to negotiate a Governing International Maritime Agreement with each nation with which the United States traded a specified amount of dry bulk cargo in 1980. Directs the Secretary to also negotiate such an agreement with nations whose U.S. trade was less than the specified amount if such a nation asks to negotiate an agreement. Lists the essential provisions of a Governing International Maritime Agreement. Directs the Secretary to enter into such an agreement with any group of nations which desires to execute the agreement on a regional basis. Prohibits such an agreement from becoming effective until 60 days after it is transmitted to Congress. Sets forth the procedures for a Congressional veto of such an agreement. Prohibits a non-national-flag ship from transporting dry bulk cargo with a trading partner except as authorized by the Governing International Maritime Agreement. Provides that five years after enactment of this Act: (1) non-national-flag ships not documented under the laws of a trading partner are prohibited from transporting dry bulk cargo; and (2) such ships documented under the laws of a trading partner are authorized to transport dry bulk cargo between the United States and any nation not a party to such an agreement. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury to implement procedures to insure that non-national-flag ships do not transport bulk cargo in excess of the authorized amount. Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory committee to assist in implementing this Act. Requires it to report annually to Congress on its activities. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress annually on actions taken pursuant to this Act."
