Directs the Government to indemnify a supplier for product liability unless a court determines that such liability is a result of the supplier's negligence. Declares that the United States consents to be sued for indemnity under this Act. Permits the indemnification of a supplier only if the settlement or compromise of a product liability claim is approved by the Attorney General or an appropriate court adjudicating an action seeking indemnification. Requires any product supplied to a foreign government under a Federal program to be considered a product supplied to the United States Government for purposes of this Act."
