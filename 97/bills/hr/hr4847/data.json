    "text": "Aircraft Sabotage Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to redefine the offense of \"destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities\" to, among other revisions: (1) prohibit communicating false information which endangers any aircraft in flight; (2) prohibit any act of violence against any individual on an aircraft which is likely to endanger the aircraft in service; and (3) define \"in service\" to mean pre- and post-flight ground preparation. Establishes criminal penalties for whoever commits an offense in violation of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation and is afterward found in the United States. Establishes a new Federal crime of \"imparting or conveying threats\" to commit an act which would constitute the felony of aircraft sabotage if executed. Amends the Federal Aviation Act to establish civil penalties for conveying false information regarding aircraft crimes and concealing a deadly weapon while boarding an aircraft. Makes any person who willfully and maliciously conveys false information criminally liable."
