    "text": "Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to revise the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to lease lands containing oil shale deposits. Permits such leases to exceed 5120 acres of land if necessary to permit long-term commercial operations. Increases the number of such leases which may be held to two in any State and four nationwide. Permits the acquisition of one additional lease in a State by a lessee who has achieved commercial production in both existing leases and is within ten years of exhausting the reserves on one of the leases. Authorizes the unlimited issuance of leases to avoid bypassing small acreages of oil shale resources which otherwise could not be mined economically. Authorizes the Secretary to issue leases allowing the mining of other mineral deposits contained in the lands covered by the oil share lease. Authorize lessees of oil shale lands to lease additional lands for operational purposes. Limits such additional leases to not more than 6,400 acres. Provides that land leased pursuant to this provision may not be used for oil shale mining but may be used for any other purpose authorized by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the lessee to show to the Secretary's satisfaction the need for the additional land and the ability to conduct environmentally safe operations. Requires the Secretary's determination that the additional lease is in the public interest. Establishes guidelines for other lease provisions including rent and duration."
