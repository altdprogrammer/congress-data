Directs the Secretary to relocate the water supply intake facility on the Missouri River at Springfield, South Dakota. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with specified entities concerning the water from the San Juan-Choma project, New Mexico, in the Abiquiu and Elephant Butte Reservoirs.
