    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-02-04", 
    "text": "Youth Employment Act - Amends the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act(CETA) to revise the statement of purpose and definitions of title IV (Youth Programs). Changes the heading of title IV, Part A to \"Youth Employment and Training\" (formerly, 'Youth Employment Demonstration Programs\"). Revises the purpose of such part to include the provision of employment experience, skill training, and remedial programs designed to improve the long-term employability of disadvantaged and hard-to-employ youth, emphasizing collaborative agreements, where feasible, among local institutions capable of providing needed services. Requires that each CETA Youth Employment and Training fund: (1) develop achievement standards, based on recommendations of various groups, to serve as performance indicators, accepted in the community, of youth achievements needed to obtain and retain unsubsidized jobs in the private sector; (2) establish and maintain an individual achievement record for each participating youth; and (3) formulate a personalized employability plan and periodically assess, with educational officials, the appropriateness for each youth of employment, training, and services assisted under Youth Employment and Training. Defines an eligible youth, for Youth Employment and Training purposes, as one who is economically disadvantaged and aged 16 to 19, inclusive, or aged 20 or 21 if enrolled in high school or in a program leading to a certificate of high school equivalency. Extends eligibility, only for purposes of counseling and related services, to economically disadvantaged youth aged 14 or 15. Permits 20 percent of the funds available for Basic Grants for Youth Employment and Training Programs to be used for youths: (1) who are not economically disadvantaged but have encountered special barriers to employment; or (2) who are participants in a program under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974; or (3) who are of migrant or seasonal farmworker families. Provides that any participant in specified programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds under the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall be eligible for purposes of CETA Title IV Part A Youth Employment and Training programs. Defines eligible applicants, for Part A purposes, as prime sponsors and (under special regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Labor) sponsors of Native American or migrant and seasonal farmworker programs. Establishes a new CETA program of Basic Grants for Youth Employment and Training Programs, designed to make a significant long-term impact on structural youth unemployment problems and to enhance job and career prospects through interrelated employment, training, and education. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) to provide assistance to eligible applicants to provide to eligible youth a range of employability development opportunities and supportive and follow-up services to promote the transition to unsubsidized employment. Sets forth formulas for the allocation of program funds and conditions for receipt of financial assistance. Establishes a new CETA program of Youth Incentive and Supplemental Work Projects. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program providing economically disadvantaged youth in selected poverty areas with part-time employment, full-time employment, or other appropriate compensated activity by allowing eligible applicants to pay one-half of the program cost with funds provided under the Basic Grants program and the other half with funds provided under the Youth Incentive program. Directs the Secretary to enter into arrangements with prime sponsors to provide: (1) part-time entitlement activities (full-time during the summer months) during the school year for eligible youth from selected poverty areas who resume or maintain secondary school attendance to acquire a high school diploma or equivalency certificate; and (2) otherwise unavailable full-time employment for economically disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 21, inclusive, from selected poverty areas who have a high school diploma or certificate. Directs the Secretary to make tentative advance allocations to eligible applicants for such purposes. Sets forth the extent of entitlement activities. Sets forth procedures for applications and Secretarial review. Prohibits the use of funds for employment under the Youth Incentive program to provide public services previously provided by a political subdivision or local education agency in the area served by the project. Sets forth formulas for the allocation of program funds. Authorizes the Secretary to use discretionary funds to provide: (1) supplemental funds for Basic Grants and Youth Incentive applicants to promote specially worthy programs and programs for youths with special employment barriers or from specified categories and to provide additional allocations to areas experiencing significant increases in unemployment; (2) innovative and experimental programs; (3) outreach and public information programs for juvenile offenders; and (4) projects which will employ eligible youth, particularly economically disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 21, in solar energy and other forms of energy conservation and development. Amends the Wagner-Peyser Act to establish new employment services for youth program. Requires that each State desiring to receive funds under such program submit to the Secretary of Labor a supplement to required plans. Authorizes the Secretary to operate such programs in States which do not submit such a supplement. Requires that such supplements provide for specified general employment services for youth and for specified in school services to assist youth in making a successful transition from school to working life. Requires that such services include the provision of information concerning military and civilian volunteer services opportunities. Limits the Federal share to 80 percent of the cost of such programs. Sets forth formulas for the allocation of funds for such programs. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal year 1981 and fiscal years thereafter. Directs the Secretary of Labor to include in the annual CETA report a statement of findings on the progress made in the implementation of CETA provisions relating to the elimination of artificial barriers to employment. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1985 to carry out CETA Youth Employment and Training. Authorizes such appropriations to be included in the appropriation Act for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which such appropriations are available for obligation. Sets forth transition provisions."
