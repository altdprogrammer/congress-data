Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, State maternal and child health agencies for projects to implement the statewide perinatal systems plan. Requires an application for such a grant or cooperative agreement, in order to be approved, to: (1) provide for the coordination of services under titles V and XIX; (2) provide for the designation of regional advisory boards; (3) provide for the development of a case management system; and (4) provide for the furnishing of perinatal services identified as needed through the case management system.
