Permits a consumer to void any contract or agreement in commerce which provides for the purchase of goods or services and results from a transaction involving an unfair consumer practice. Makes any person who induces a consumer into such contracts or agreements liable to such consumer for treble damages and legal costs. Authorizes State attorneys general to bring civil actions in Federal or State courts, as parens patriae for consumer residents, to secure treble damages and legal costs for unfair consumer practices, with monetary relief to be distributed among consumers or deposited with the State. Authorizes the U.S. Attorney General or any State attorney general to bring an action to enjoin an unfair consumer practice. Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for whoever uses an instrumentality of commerce to willfully or negligently engage in an unfair consumer practice."
