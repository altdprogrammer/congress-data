Defines a \"financially responsible person\" as one who is capable of paying the purchase price of a railroad line and the expenses of providing service over the line for at least two years. Amends the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act to declare that the ICC's authority to grant temporary operating approval for the use of Rock Island or Milwaukee Railroad facilities shall continue until a plan of reorganization or liquidation is approved by the ICC and the bankruptcy court."
