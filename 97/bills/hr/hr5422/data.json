Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recompute the primary insurance amounts of title II beneficiaries whose benefits are based upon the formula for computing the primary insurance amount as in effect with respect to benefits for months before January 1983. Makes such recomputation effective for benefits for months starting with January 1983."
