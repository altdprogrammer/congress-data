    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Regulatory Reform Act - Amends title XIV of the Public Health Service Act (the \"Safe Drinking Water Act\") to revise regulatory procedures relating to safe drinking water requirements. Provides for administrative procedures and judicial review of such procedures relating to the promulgation or amendment, under such title, of: (1) any national interim primary drinking water regulation; (2) any revised national primary drinking water regulation; and (3) any regulation for State underground injection control programs. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a rulemaking docket for such rulemaking actions. Requires the establishment of an identical docket in the appropriate regional office of the Agency whenever a rule applies only within a particular State. Requires that notice in the Federal Register of such proposed rulemaking be accompanied by: (1) a statement of its basis and purpose; (2) the docket number, location, and times for public inspection; and (3) notice of the period available for public comment. Sets forth procedures for written and oral public comment and inclusion of such comment in the docket. Requires that a promulgated rule be accompanied by statements of: (1) its basis and purpose; (2) the reasons for any major changes from the proposed rule; (3) factual data and reasons supporting a determination that the benefits of applying the rule justify the compliance costs; (4) the reasons why any public comment alternatives to the proposed rule were rejected; and (5) response to significant public comment, criticism, and new data submissions. Prohibits basing the promulgated rule on any information not in the docket. Limits the record for judicial review to docket materials and required accompaniments to the promulgated rule. Directs the Administrator to convene a proceeding for reconsideration of a rule upon a demonstration that an objection of central relevance to the rule could not be raised during the public comment period. Provides for judicial review of refusals of such reconsideration. Authorizes the Administrator or the appropriate U.S. court of appeals to stay the effectiveness of the rule for up to three months during reconsideration. Sets forth provisions for judicial review of procedural determinations of the Administrator. Permits statutory deadlines for promulgation of rules to be extended to not more than six months after the proposal date, if necessary, to afford the public and the Agency adequate opportunity to carry out this Act. Permits petitions for judicial review of administrative actions under such Act to be filed only in the U.S. court of appeals for a judicial circuit in which a substantial portion of the associated impact or injury will occur. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Revises standards for primary drinking water regulations. Replaces regulation of contaminants having \"any adverse effect\" on human health with regulation of contaminants \"posing an unreasonable risk to human health\". Removes a requirement that such regulations provide for proper operation and maintenance of public water systems, minimum quality of water taken into the systems, and new facilities siting. Eliminates specified references to the Administrator's judgments or determinations and to allowance for \"an adequate margin of safety\" in promulgating such regulations. Requires the maximum contaminant level specified in revised national primary drinking water regulations for a contaminant to be as close to the recommended maximum contaminant level as is \"reasonable\" (currently, \"feasible\"). Removes specified provisions relating to requirements for the use of treatment techniques. Continues State primary enforcement responsibility whenever the Administrator revises or amends any national primary drinking water regulation. Requires a State with primary enforcement responsibility to show the Administrator that the State public water system supervision program meets the revised or added requirement, within a specified period. Requires the Administrator's approval of continuation of the State's primary enforcement responsibility. Authorizes the Administrator to waive a prohibition against making grants to State public water system supervision programs that have not assumed and maintained primary enforcement responsibility. Permits such waiver during any time within 18 months after the effective date of any amendment or revision of the national regulations if the State has assumed such responsibility and is making a diligent effort to comply with the new amendment or revision. Authorizes the Administrator to grant a State an additional six months to come into compliance, on a showing of good cause."
