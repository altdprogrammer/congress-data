Title II: Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands - Amends the date for transferring certain U.S. property located in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to the governments of such islands.

Limits the aggregate principal amount of such obligations which may be guaranteed. Prohibits any commitment to guarantee after a specified date. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee payment of principal and interest on bonds and other obligations issued by the Power Authority. Prohibits any such guarantee unless the Secretary makes specified determinations. Authorizes the United States to withhold payment of money due American Samoa and to use the withheld amount to offset any U.S. claim against American Samoa or the Power Authority if the Secretary determines that the Power Authority will not meet its obligation to pay interest and principal. Title V: Miscellaneous - Transfers the duty to prepare a comprehensive energy plan for specified insular areas of the United States from the Secretary of Energy to the Secretary of the Interior.
