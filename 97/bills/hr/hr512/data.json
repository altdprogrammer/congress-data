Directs the President, upon an affirmative determination, to: (1) terminate diplomatic relations with such country; (2) terminate all U.S. military and economic assistance to such country; and (3) prohibit the transfer of such country's property and assets located within U.S. jurisdiction. Provides for the removal of such sanctions if such country: (1) restores custody of U.S. property and employees; and (2) makes adequate restitution. Authorizes the President to impose a fine, paid out of such country's assets located within U.S. jurisdiction, for each day U.S. property or employees are illegally held by foreign nations."
