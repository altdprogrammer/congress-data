    "text": "Natural Gas Marketing Act of 1982 - Provides that whenever a gas distributing company, State commission, municipality, or State files a complaint under the Natural Gas Act alleging that any rate proposed by a natural gas company is not just and reasonable, and certifies that such proposed rate results in a retail price for natural gas that is in excess of the prices of a competing fuel available to existing retail customers served by any of the natural gas company's wholesale customers, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) shall set the matter for hearing and decision. Suspends any rate increase until issuance of a final appealable order upon completion of the hearing. Places the burden of proof on the natural gas company. Directs FERC to prescribe an adjustment in the natural gas company's rates if the company does not discharge its burden of proof."
