Repeals Public Law 97-49 which provided for an increase in the temporary public debt limit of $679,800,000,000. Permits the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, to provide for increases and decreases in the investment yield on any outstanding United States savings bond, except that the investment yield on any bond for the period held may not be decreased below the minimum yield for such period guaranteed at the time of its issuance. Declares that, in the case of any savings bond issued before the 30th day after enactment of this Act, the minimum yield guaranteed for the period held shall be the scheduled investment yield for such period in effect on such 30th day. Increases to $100,000,000,000 the limit on the face amount of bonds issued to the public under the Second Liberty Bond Act."
