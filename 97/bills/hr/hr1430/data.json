States that the Secretary may, with respect to the siting of such a powerplant, require one environmental impact statement to be used by all the Federal agencies involved. Authorizes the Secretary to require Federal agencies to conduct consolidated proceedings if there is concurrent jurisdiction. Requires the Secretary, with the concurrence of State agencies, to prescribe consolidated proceedings procedures for matters over which Federal and State agencies have concurrent jurisdiction. Directs the Secretary to establish a reasonable deadline for Federal agency decisions on the siting of coal-fired powerplants. Directs the Secretary to provide Federal assistance to State programs for coordinating and improving decision procedures for the construction and operation of coal-fired powerplants. Sets forth the criteria for such programs. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to eliminate duplicative application and reporting form requirements for any person proposing a coal-fired powerplant project. Requires an applicant for a license, permit, or approval from any Federal agency for construction or operation of a new coal-fired powerplant which is not proximately sited to explain in the application why proximate siting is infeasible. States that the Secretary may, by rule, pay the costs of participating in a Federal proceeding with respect to a coal-fired powerplant to any intervenor who is unable to pay such costs."
