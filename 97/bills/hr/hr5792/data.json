Directs the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of Social Security in prescribing regulations to determine the amount of the increase on the basis of such reductions. Prohibits increasing any Pell grant to an amount exceeding the difference between expected family contribution and cost of attendance. Permits increasing the Pell grant to an amount exceeding the maximum dollar amount and the maximum percentage of cost of attendance established under such Act. Requires that funds for such increases be appropriated separately from other Pell grant funds. Provides for a ratable reduction in the amount of each increase if the funds so appropriated are not sufficient."
