    "text": "Hostage Relief Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Hostage Relief Act of 1980 to revise the definition of \"hostage period\" to authorize the Secretary of State to determine the beginning and ending dates of the period of captivity. Requires that a hostage remain in captive status for 30 days or more in order for that hostage's pay to be deposited in the special savings fund. Limits the amount that a hostage's employing agency may pay in medical and health care expenses by the amount that the hostage or hostage's family is covered by other Government medical or health programs. Revises requirements for education and training benefits authorized to be paid to a hostage's spouse or child. Revises eligibility requirements for the extension to captive individuals of the provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 deferring civil actions that affect property rights of such persons until their missing status is ended. Repeals certain provisions of the Hostage Relief Act which: (1) apply provisions of such Act to a specified American held hostage in Colombia; (2) exclude from gross income compensation received by a hostage during the period of captivity; (3) cancel the income tax of a hostage who dies as a result of captivity; and (4) set forth definitions. Authorizes the President to pay an additional benefit to the family of any hostage who dies in captive status."
