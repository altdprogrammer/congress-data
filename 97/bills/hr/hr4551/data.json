    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that a specified amount of the funds available for fiscal year 1982 for development assistance should be earmarked for aid to Haiti. Authorizes additional funds for agricultural development in rural areas in order to make the earmarked funds available for Haiti. States that aid for Haiti should be provided to the maximum extent possible through private and voluntary organizations. Authorizes spending for certain economic and military assistance programs for Haiti and approving certain foreign military credits and guarantees for Haiti only if the President makes a specified determination concerning Haiti's emigration and human rights policies. Directs the President to report to Congress on Haiti's actions with regard to such policies. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the use of foreign assistance funds to provide police training to help halt significant illegal emigration to the United States from foreign countries."
