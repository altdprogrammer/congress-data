Directs the Federal Insurance Administrator, within one year of enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the feasibility of insuring property which is located outside of, but on the same real estate lot as, a currently insured residential structure. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to pay to any person who, during a specified period prior to enactment of this Act, incurred property damage caused by a flood-related landslide. Provides that such amount equal the amount payable if such damage had been covered by such insurance. Authorizes appropriations."
