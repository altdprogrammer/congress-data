Provides that funds attributable to the tax imposed on the sale of component parts of firearms ammunition may be used by a State solely for the purpose of paying not more than 75 percent of the cost of a hunter education program or a program for the acquisition, construction and maintenance of public target ranges, or both such programs. Specifies certain conditions for the operation of such programs. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to carry out a continuing study regarding the use made by the States of the funds provided under this Act for hunter education and public target range programs. Directs the Secretary to submit such study to the Congress not later than October 1, 1986, together with the recommendation as to whether such funds should continue to be provided to the States. Title II: Tax on Sale of Component Parts of Firearm Ammunition - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on the sale of component parts of firearm ammunition."
