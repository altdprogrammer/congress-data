    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-759) Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 - Title I: Agriculture, Forestry, and Related Programs - Subtitle A: Dairy Price Support Program - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Agriculture and Food Act, to set the price of milk for domestic needs at: (1) $13.10 per hundredweight for FY 1983 and 1984; and (2) at the percentage of parity for FY 1985 which $13.10 represented as of October 1, 1983. Grants the Secretary of Agriculture authority to provide for a deduction of 50 cents per hundredweight for the period beginning October 1, 1982, and ending September 30, 1985, from the proceeds of all milk marketed by producers, to be remitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to offset a portion of the cost of the price support program. Grants the Secretary authority to provide for an additional deduction of 50 cents during such period to be remitted to the CCC subject to specified conditions. Declares that such authority for deductions shall not apply for any fiscal year for which the projected net price support purchases would be less than specified amounts. Subtitle B - Donation of Dairy Products - Authorizes domestic and foreign CCC commodity donations. States that foreign donations shall be coordinated through, and in addition to, Public Law 480 programs. Subtitle C - Adjustment Program for the 1983 Crops of Wheat, Feed Grains, Upland Cotton and Rice - Permits the Secretary, effective with respect to the 1982 crops of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice, to make advance deficiency payments available to producers who participate in an acreage limitation program, if the Secretary determines that deficiency payments likely will be made under this Act. Sets 1983 wheat price support levels at not less than $3.65 per bushel. Provides for a combined acreage limitation or set-aside and diversion program for such crop, with the acreage base for each farm reduced by 20 percent. Requires producers to comply with such combined program in order to receive price supports. Bases 1983 wheat, feed grain, upland cotton, and rice acreage bases upon the respective 1982 bases adjusted to reflect established crop rotation practices and other factors as the Secretary determines. Directs the Secretary to set the producer loan level for the 1983 crop of corn at not less than $2.65 per bushel. Requires the Secretary to make retirement and conservation payments to participating wheat, feed grains, and rice producers. Sets the respective rates for such payments at $3.00 per bushel for wheat, $1.50 per bushel for corn, and $3.00 per hundredweight for rice. Requires: (1) the Secretary to advance at least 50 percent of any land diversion payments to a participating producer as soon as possible; and (2) a noncomplying producer to repay the advance with interest. Subtitle D - Agricultural Export Promotion - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, effective for FY 1983 through 1985, to use certain funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation for export activities. Subtitle E: Food Stamp Act Amendments of 1982 - Food Stamp Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to: (1) treat siblings living together who are not elderly, blind, or disabled as one household; and (2) treat a person 60 years or older living with others but unable to purchase and prepare meals because of medical disability as a separate household if the income of the other person does not exceed 165 percent of the nonfarm poverty guideline. Requires the rounding down of dollar amounts for the thrifty food plan in computing deductions of household income and in calculating the value of allotments. Includes disabled veterans and their survivors as eligible for benefits under the food stamp program. Excludes from household income cost-of-living increases attributable to specified provisions of the Social Security Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, and pensions for veterans of a period of war. Changes the date for adjusting deductions in computing household income from July 1, 1983, to October 1, 1983. Revises excess shelter expense deduction provisions to permit State agencies to use a standard utility allowance which does not fluctuate seasonally. Excludes from such use households not incurring or sharing such expenses. Prohibits any waiver of the requirement that migrant household income be calculated prospectively. Requires accessible pension funds and savings or retirement accounts to be counted in determining whether the financial resources limitation has been exceeded. Establishes categorical eligibility for recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children under the Social Security program. Permits the Secretary to waive certain periodic reporting requirements in order to allow States to establish periodic reporting rules similar to those for the aid to families with dependent children program. Authorizes a State to require job search information at the time of an individual's application for food stamps. Increases the ineligibility period for voluntarily quitting a job from 60 to 90 days. Declares that a Federal, State, or local government employee who engaged in a strike against his or her employer and is dismissed from his job because of his strike participation shall be considered to have voluntarily quit such job without good cause. Eliminates the exemption from work registration for parents or caretakers of children when the parent or caretaker is part of a household in which there is another ablebodied parent or caretaker subject to food stamp work requirements. Provides that a college student eligible to participate in the food stamp program may not be disqualified when he or she is the parent of a dependent child above the age of five and under the age of 12 for whom adequate child care is not available. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to use an alternative coupon issuance system if such system improves the integrity of the food stamp program. Prohibits the issuance of an initial month allotment under $10. Authorizes household information disclosure to Federal or federally-assisted programs. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to limit the operation of house-to-house trade routes to those that are reasonably necessary to provide adequate access to households if the Secretary finds that the operation of house-to-house trade routes damages the integrity of the food stamp program. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring that the States submit, for prior approval, State agency instructions, interpretations of policy, methods of administration, forms, or other materials, unless the State determines that they alter or amend its plan of operation for the food stamp program. Eliminates the requirement that State agencies comply with Federal standards with regard to points and hours of certification and issuance. Permits the Secretary to restrict the number of households which may be represented by an individual. Requires expedited service to destitute migrant households or households with no income. Authorizes a State agency to promptly reduce or terminate benefits for any household which provides written information that clearly requires a reduction or termination. Requires State agencies to establish a system to verify periodically that individuals are not receiving food stamps in more than one jurisdiction in the State. Permits each State to choose: (1) whether AFDC and general assistance households must have their food stamp applications included in their AFDC or general assistance applications; and (2) whether food stamp applicants must be certified eligible based on information in their AFDC or general assistance case file. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to require State food stamp agencies to conduct at least annual verification or other measures to ensure that individuals who have been \"cashed out\" of the food stamp program are not also receiving food stamps. Sets forth formulae for reducing a State agency's federally-funded share of administrative costs based upon the State's payment error rate. Increases from $5,000 to $10,000 the civil money penalties and sets periods of disqualification for retail or wholesale food stores that violate such Act. Permits the Secretary to require a retail food store or wholesale food concern to furnish a bond to cover the value of the coupons which such store may in the future accept and redeem. Permits a State to use other means of collection for fraud and nonfraud overissuances besides cash repayment and benefit offset. Allows the household of a disqualified person 30 days to choose a reduced allotment or a cash repayment to reimburse the Government for an overissuance of coupons. Requires the Secretary to study the impact of benefit reductions and make a final report to the appropriate congressional committees by March 1, 1985.
