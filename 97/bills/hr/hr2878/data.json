    "text": "Rice Production Act of 1981 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to extend the established price and loan program for rice through the 1985 crop year. Increases from $6.31 to $8.00 per hundredweight the minimum loan level for rice. Sets a formula for the determination of additional payments to cooperators, but not on a greater acreage than that actually planted to rice. Limits the maximum number of acres eligible for prevented planting disaster payments to the acreage actually planted to rice for harvest in the immediately preceding year. Denies eligibility for disaster payments on the 1982 through 1985 crops of rice to any person in a county in which Federal crop insurance is generally offered. Establishes a general guideline for the determination of the national program acreage for the 1982 through 1985 crops of rice in place of the current mandatory 1,800,000 acres. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine a program allocation factor for each crop (no more than 100 percent nor less than 80 percent), which shall be used in the computation of individual farm acreage allotments. Continues the Secretary's authority to provide for a set aside of cropland but only if the total supply of rice will likely exceed national needs. Requires any rice producer setting cropland aside for conservation uses to limit rice actually planted for harvest to an acreage which when added to the amount set aside will not exceed the sum of the acreage planted and the acreage set aside, if any, from the previous crop year. Repeals certain provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 with respect to acreage allotment and marketing quotas which are not in conformity with the provisions of this Act."
