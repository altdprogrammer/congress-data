Permits such employers to agree with a labor organization to make membership in such organization a condition of performing arts employment. Allows such employers to make agreements with a labor organization covering performing artists even if the majority status of the organization has not yet been established. Excludes employers in the broadcasting or motion picture industries from such exemptions. Defines \"employer\" to include purchasers of musical performance services. Defines \"employee\" to include independent contractors engaged to perform musical services."
