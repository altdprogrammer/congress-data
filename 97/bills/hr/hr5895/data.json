    "text": "Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act to repeal provisions: (1) prohibiting the issuance of a lease to any entity which has held a coal lease for at least ten years and is not producing coal in commercial quantities under such lease; and (2) requiring diligent development of a logical mining unit such that the coal reserves of the entire unit must be mined within a period not to exceed 40 years. Provides that the Secretary of the Interior will not require the payment of advance royalties for failure to meet the production requirement unless the Secretary determines that the public interest will not be served thereby. (Current law authorizes the Secretary to suspend such requirement if the Secretary determines that it will serve the public interest.) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to exempt coking coal from the requirements of diligent development and continued operation. States that such exemption shall be applicable upon a showing that coking coal deposits are dedicated to the support of steelmaking facilities."
