    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Specifies that such offense shall apply to use of a firearm, which has been transported in interstate and foreign commerce, during commission of any robbery, assault, rape, burglary, kidnapping, or homicide. Permits any State court having jurisdiction over such offenses to enforce this Act. Requires the imprisonment of a first offender for at least ten years (currently, one to ten years) and of a second or subsequent offender for at least 25 years (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the directions, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or grant probation and that the additional sentence not run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the offense itself."
