Defines \"qualified subchapter S trust\" as a trust which meets the following requirements: (1) the sole income beneficiary is a U.S. citizen or resident under a disability for purposes of eligibility for Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance benefits; (2) the beneficiary is the sole recipient of trust corpus or income; (3) the trust terminates at the death of the beneficiary; (4) at least 90 percent of the value of contributions to the trust consists of stock in one subchapter S corporation; (5) all of the contributions are includible in the gross estate of the grantor and pass to the trust at the grantor's death; and (6) the beneficiary or a legal representative has irrevocably elected that the beneficiary shall be treated as the owner of the trust. Terminates the status of a qualified subchapter S trust at any time during which the trust owns no subchapter S corporation stock or the corporation ceases to qualify as such."
