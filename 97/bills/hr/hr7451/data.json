    "text": "Sets annual special use permit fees for all recreation residences on national forest system lands. Sets such fees at four percent of the value of the recreational residence, on the site under permit, as established by the county or other local tax assessing authority within which the property is located. Provides for Forest Service valuation of such residences where the county elects not to establish and furnish such valuation. Limits such annual fees to no less than $200 and no more than $3,000. Provides that: (1) 50 percent of such fee be credited to the local property assessing authority; (2) 25 percent be available for Forest Service recreation programs in the national forest where the permit is situated; and (3) 25 percent be deposited in the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Requires that such fees for new and reissued permits, issued after enactment of this Act, be determined according to this Act. Allows other permittees to voluntarily request to go under the fee system provided for in this Act or to remain under the existing fee system established by the Secretary of Agriculture. Provides for a five-year period of no increase in fees for permittees who volunteer to go under the new system. Provides that the amount of such a fee shall not be subject to administrative appeal before the Secretary or the Forest Service, if the fee is determined by the local tax assessing authority."
