Limits such damages, for an accused convicted of a criminal offense, to actual physical and property damage sustained, but not less than $500. Establishes the same minimum liquidated damages for any other case. Sets a maximum amount of damages at $25,000. Grants State courts exclusive jurisdiction of such actions. Sets a two-year statute of limitations for the commencement of such actions."
