Rept. 97-985) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit to ten percent the income tax rate on Virgin Islands source income and provide for corresponding changes in tax withholding. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to permit an individual who has been found to be no longer eligible for disability benefits and who has requested a hearing with respect to such determination to elect to have the payment of such benefits continued during the administrative appeals process, through June 1984. Provides that if the decision after the hearing affirms the determination that the individual is not entitled to such benefits, any benefits paid pending the hearing shall be considered overpayments. Limits the above provisions to determinations of ineligibility made before October, 1983. Makes the requirement that disability determinations under title II be reviewed at least every three years applicable only to the extent that sufficient personnel and processing time are available. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the number of cases which may be adequately reviewed by the applicable State agency or by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to report annually to specified Congressional committees with respect to such determinations. Requires evidentiary hearings accessible to the disabled individual in reconsiderations of disability benefit terminations. States that this requirement shall become effective no later than 1984. Directs the Secretary to take the necessary steps to assure public understanding of the importance Congress places on face-to-face reconsiderations. Requires the Secretary to develop procedures for the conduct of such reconsiderations and to advise beneficiaries of the importance of submitting all evidence. Directs the Secretary to report semiannually to specified Congressional committees on the number and results of continuing disability reviews. Amends the Social Security Amendments of 1977 to revise provisions for the reduction of spousal security benefits by a certain percent of the amount received as a public pension. Provides that such offset shall not apply to dependent spouses who become eligible for a public pension prior to July 1983. Requires the Secretary to study the pension offset provisions and make legislative recomendations to Congress by May 15, 1983."
