Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of authorized funds for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of Congress unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to all the appropriate Congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement as specified. Imposes specified limits on the cost and cost overruns of general plant projects and construction projects. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Federal agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for proposed construction projects with amounts authorized for plant engineering and design, and to perform such services using available funds for any Department of Energy defense activity construction project in the event of any national emergency. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to grant the power of arrest without a warrant under specified circumstance to employees authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry firearms for security reasons in the discharge of their official duties."
