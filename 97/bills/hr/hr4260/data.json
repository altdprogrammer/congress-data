    "text": "Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981- Title I: Individual Income Tax Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce individual and estate and trust income tax rates for 1982, 1983, and 1984 and thereafter. Reduces the highest marginal tax rate on all types of income from 70 to 50 percent, effective in 1982. Repeals the 50 percent maximum tax rate on personal service income, effective in 1982. Reduces the alternative minimum tax and the personal holding company tax to correspond with the reductions in the highest marginal tax rates. Establishes a maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains of 20 percent for sales and exchanges occurring and or after June 9, 1981. Decreases from one year to six months the holding period required for long-term capital gain or loss treatment. Allows a tax credit equal to one and one-fourth of an individual's regular tax liability for taxable year 1981. Revises withholding requirements to provide for withholding reductions of five percent in 1981, ten percent in 1982, and ten percent in 1983. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations permitting workers to increase or decrease their withholding allowances. Allows married individuals filing a joint return an income tax deduction from gross income of ten percent of the lesser of $30,000 or the earned income of the lower income spouse. Specifies that the rate of such deduction will be five percent, instead of ten, in taxable year 1982. Requires annual cost of living adjustments, based on the Consumer Price Index, to individual income tax rates, the personal tax exemption, withholding requirements, and minimum income tax return amounts, beginning in 1985. Increases from $20,000 to $75,000 in 1982 (with annual adjustments up to $95,000 in 1986 and thereafter) the earned income exclusion for U.S. citizens working abroad who are bona fide residents of a foreign country. Repeals the requirement that, as a condition of their employment, such individuals reside in a hardship area. Reduces from 17 to 11 months the residency requirement for such exclusion. Permits the tax exclusion of the housing costs of such individuals in the amount by which the taxpayer's housing costs exceed 16 percent of a GS-14, step 1 salary level for a Federal employee. Permits a tax deduction for excess housing costs which are not excludable. Waives the residency requirements for such exclusion if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the taxpayer would otherwise have met the residency requirement but for the occurrence of civil unrest, war, or other adverse conditions precluding the normal conduct of business. Repeals the existing income tax deduction for certain living expenses of U.S. citizens abroad. Provides for an income tax exclusion for the value of employer-provided lodging in a camp in cases where satisfactory housing is not generally available.

Increases from 18 months to 2 years the rollover period for deferral of tax on gain from the role of a principal residence. Title II: Business Incentive Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the method for determining useful lives of business assets for purposes of computing allowable depreciation deductions. Replaces the asset depreciation range (ADR) method with a schedule of capital cost recovery periods for four classes of business property. Establishes cost recovery periods for the following classes of business property: (1) three-year property, including certain tangible personal property with a present class life of four years or less or property used for research or experimentation; (2) five- year property, including certain tangible personal property which is not three-year property, ten-year property or 15 year public utility property; (3) ten-year property, including certain real property, public utility property or three-year property with a present class life of more than 18 but less than 25 years, certain real property with a present class life of 12.5 years or less, and railroad tank cars; (4) 15-year public utility property, including all personal property with a present class life of more than 25 years. Sets forth separate recovery schedules for property placed in service before 1985 and property placed in service after 1985. Establishes as a separate class of business property 15-year real property which includes real property with a present class life of more than 12.5 years. Directs the Secretary to prescribe a schedule of recovery for such property which provides for a 15-year recovery period and which utilizes the declining balance method of depreciation in the early years of recovery with a switch to the straight-line method in the remaining years. Permits taxpayers to elect to use the straight-line method of depreciation with specified other recovery periods in lieu of the prescribed accelerated method. Defines \"unadjusted basis\" for purposes of determining gain or loss on the disposition of accelerated recovery property. Sets forth rules for the nonrecognition of gain on the disposition of assets from mass asset accounts. Excludes from eligibility for accelerated cost recovery the following types of property: (1) property placed in service before January 1, 1981; (2) property depreciable on a basis other than time; (3) public utility property for which the normalization method of accounting is not used; (4) certain property placed in service prior to 1981 which is transferred or leased in a transaction occurring after 1981 which does not alter its use; and (5) certain property transferred in corporate liquidations and reorganizations, and certain contributions to and distributions by partnerships.

Sets the amount of such deduction at $5000 in 1982 increased by biennial increments of $2,500, up to $10,000 in 1986. Requires the recapture as ordinary income of excess depreciation from recovery property which is subsequently sold or exchanged. Treats the accelerated cost recovery deduction as an item of tax preference for purposes of the minimum tax. Revises the method of computing the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation. Specifies that such adjustment shall be determined using the straight-line method of depreciation over prescribed extended recovery periods. Extends the carryover periods for certain net operating losses and tax credits. Revises the applicable percentage for determination of the investment tax credit to make eligible for such credit: (1) 100 percent of the basis of ten-year, five-year recovery property, or 15-year public utility property; and (2) 60 percent of the basis of three-year recovery property. Revises the progress expenditure rules to eliminate the useful life requirement for depreciable property being constructed by or for a taxpayer for use in a trade or business (qualified process expenditure property) and to apply to such property the revised percentages for determining the investment tax credit under this Act. Qualifies petroleum product storage facilities for the investment tax credit. Limits the amount of the investment tax credit to the amount that the taxpayer has at risk. Sets forth special at risk limitations for certain third-party lenders. Revises the recapture rules for recovery property eligible for the investment tax credit.

Repeals the special 60-month amortization rules for certified historic structures and rules permitting accelerated depreciation for rehabilitated certified historic structures. Increases the limit on the amount of used property eligible for the investment tax credit. Allows a nonrefundable income tax credit for 25 percent of the qualified research expenses incurred by a taxpayer in carrying on any trade or business to the extent that such expenses exceed the average amount of the taxpayer's expenses in a specified base period. Defines \"qualified research expenses\" an amount paid or incurred for in-house and contract research. Allows such credit for basic research contracted out to colleges, universities, and tax-exempt scientific research institutes. Excludes from eligibility for such credit research conducted outside the United States, research in the social sciences or humanities, and research funded by any other person or governmental entity. Provides for a three-year carryback and a seven-year carryover of any unused credit amounts. Terminates such credit after 1985. Increases the limits on the allowable deduction for corporate charitable contributions of inventory property which is contributed to an institution of higher education and used for research purposes. Sets forth eligibility requirements for such deduction, including the following: (1) that such property be scientific equipment or apparatus; (2) that the donee use such property in the United States; and (3) that the use of the property be for research in the physical or biological sciences.

Increases the allowable number of shareholders in a Subchapter S corporation from 15 to 25. Permits qualified trusts to be shareholders of Suchchapter S corprations.

Requires that such certificates be made available in $500 denominations have a maturity of one year, and have an investment yield which does not exceed 70 percent of the Treasury bill rate. Permits such exclusion only to the extent that the interest income received by the taxpayer exceeds the amount of such income received in the previous year, up to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint returns).

Revises the definition of \"qualified joint interest\" for purposes of the 50 percent valuation of interests in property held by the decedent and the decedent's spouse. Qualifies certain terminable interests for the marital deduction. Requires the inclusion in the gross estate of any property in which the decedent had an income interest for life if the marital deduction was allowed with respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent. Provides that any disposition of an income interest for life in any property shall be treated as a transfer of such property if the marital deduction was allowed when such property was transferred to the donor. Provides for a right of recovery of estate and gift tax in the case of certain marital deduction property. Increases the maximum reduction (currently $500,000) in fair market value under the special estate tax valuation based on use for certain farms and small businesses annually to $1,000,000 in 1983 and thereafter. Allows property put to a qualified use by a family member to qualify for special use valuation. Qualifies estates of decedents who were disabled or retired for the special valuation of certain farms based on use if such decedents materially participated in the operation of the farm for five out of eight years preceding the year in which they became disabled or eligible for disability benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Permits the spouse of a decedent to use such valuation if the spouse takes over active management upon the decedent's death. Reduces from 15 to ten years the length of time a qualified property must be held and put to a qualified use following the decedent's death before it can be disposed of without incurring a recapture of estate tax benefits. Permits active management rather than material participation as a test for qualification of the estate for special use valuation for spouses, children under 21, students, and disabled individuals who receive property from a decedent who qualified for special use valuation. Allows the like kind exchange of property without loss of special use valuation eligibility. Allows valuation based on net crop share rentals as an alternative method of valuing farms.

Includes in the value of woodlands which qualify for the special use valuation the value of the trees growing on such property. Requires the recapture of estate tax benefits upon the disposition or severance of standing timber on such property. Permits an increase in basis of specially valued property on which a recapture tax is paid. Redefines \"family member\" for purposes of the special use valuation. Qualifies certain property transferred to a discretionary trust and certain property purchased from a decedent's estate for such valuation. Requires that an election of specially valued property be made on the decedent's estate tax return (rather than by the due date of that return as under present law). Provides that any period of ownership, qualified use, or material participation in the operation of a farm or other business by the decedent or family member shall be applied to qualified replacement property in the case of a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of the original property. Sets forth a procedure for making binding determinations of the farm market value of property eligible for the special use valuation. Modifies the alternate extension of time for payment of the estate tax the where the estate consists largely of an interest in a closely held business to: (1) allow an installment payment election if the value of the interest in the closely held business is 35 percent of the value of the gross estate; (2) revise the formula regarding the inclusion in the value of a gross estate of interests in two or more closely held business; (3) increase to 50 percent the value of an interest disposed of which will accelerate the payment of tax; (4) permit payment, but with a penalty, of an installment within six months after the due date; and (5) provide that payment of tax will not be accelerated upon the death of decedent's heir or a subsequent transferee if the interest passes to a family member. Authorizes the Tax Court to issue declaratory judgments with respect to controversies involving the extension of time for payment of the estate tax. Provides that, for purposes of the estate and gift tax charitable deduction, a work of art and the coypright on such work of art shall be treated as separate properties.

Provides an unlimited gift tax exclusion for certain transfers for educational or medical expenses. Permits the payment of gift taxes annually rather than quarterly. Title V: Tax Straddles - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers to deduct straddle losses only to the extent of the sum of straddle gains and net non-straddle commodity gains. Permits the carry forward of any disallowed straddle losses. Defines \"straddle transaction\" as the sale, exchange, or disposition of: (1) a futures contract; (2) a forward contract; (3) a commodity (including metals); (4) Treasury bills and other debt instruments; (5) currency; or (6) any interest in such assets. Exempts hedging transactions from the rule limiting straddle losses. Specifies that syndicates are not entitled to the hedging exemption. Disallows as a deduction, and makes chargeable to capital account, interest and carrying charges with respect to personal property which is part of a straddle. Exempts hedging transactions from such capitalization rule. Exempts futures traders from the capitalization rule and sets forth special rules allowing such traders to offset gains from commodity-related transactions. States that a taxpayer shall be considered to hold an offsetting position if there is a substantial reduction of the taxpayer's risk of loss from holding any position with respect to personal property because the taxpayer also holds one or more other positions with respect to such property. Creates a rebuttable presumption that two or more positions in a straddle are offsetting if: (1) the positions are in the same personal property, even if in an altered form; (2) the positions are sold or marketed as offsetting positions; (3) the aggregate margin requirement for the positions is less than the sum of the margin requirements for each position; (4) the positions are in debt instruments; or (5) the positions are determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to be offsetting positions. Provides that obligations of the United States, a State or local government, or a U.S. possession issued on a discount basis and payable without interest in less than one year shall be treated as capital assets in determining tax consequences of gain or loss with respect to such obligations. Specifies that the discount on such obligations shall be treated as ordinary income. Excludes from capital gain tax treatment gain by a securities dealer from the sale or exchange of any security, unless the security was clearly identified in the dealers's records before the end of the day after the date of acquisition as a security held for investment (currently, before the end of the 30th day after the date of acquisition). Provides that gain or loss attributable to the certain terminations of a right or obligation with respect to personal property which is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer shall be treated as gain or loss from the sale of a capital asset. States that the straddle loss limitations shall apply to property acquired and positions established after January 27, 1981. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congress on the effects of such limitation.
