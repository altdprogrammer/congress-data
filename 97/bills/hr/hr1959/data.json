Authorizes assistance to renters to offset rent attributable to fuel costs. Stipulates that participating States shall assume responsibility for certification of eligible households and issuance of coupons. Specifies the minimum and maximum monthly allotments authorized by this Act. Requires that priority be given households in regions which have been declared emergency or disaster areas as a result of fuel supply, allocation, and cost problems. States that the provisions of this Act shall be retroactively effective to January 1, 1981. Declares that the benefits received pursuant to this program shall not be considered income for internal revenue purposes or for determination of eligibility for other federally-related benefits programs. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
