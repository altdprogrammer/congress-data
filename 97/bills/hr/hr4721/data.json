    "text": "Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to include rabbit as a meat food product regulated under such Act. Prohibits the importation into the United States of meat food products unless: (1) tests have been conducted to determine whether such products contain a prohibited chemical substance or an excess level of an allowed chemical substance; (2) persons in the exporting country, who are certified by the Department of Agriculture, have conducted such tests; and (3) the appropriate government official of the exporting country has certified to the Secretary that such tests have been conducted. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a program to verify the accuracy of the required testing. Requires the Secretary to prescribe assessments and fees on imported meat food products to cover the costs of examination, inspection, and labeling as determined necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend or revoke the export privileges of any meat exporter who fails to pay such assessments."
