Sets forth factors to be considered by the task force. Directs the Secretary to establish a nationally uniform system of user fees. Allows the Secretary to increase or decrease such user fees under certain circumstances. Requires such fees to be collected by the Customs Service. Establishes the Port System Trust Fund within the Treasury. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on Trust Fund operations.

Revises financing procedures of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. Terminates Corporation obligations outstanding on the effective date of this Act. Title II: Construction and Financing of Navigation Improvement Projects to Increase the Depth of Deep-Draft Channels and Harbors to More Than Forty-Five Feet - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to expedite construction of approved navigation improvement projects if the appropriate State port authority enters into a specified agreement with the Secretary. Requires such port authority to reimburse the United States for 100 percent of construction, operation, and maintenance costs. Allows State port authorities to construct approved navigation improvement projects at their own expense and to finance such construction through the adoption of duties of tonnage. Grants the consent of Congress, subject to certain conditions, to the levying by the States of such duties of tonnage. Directs the Comptroller General to audit the operations of such State port authorities and to report to Congress thereon. Sets forth enforcement procedures concerning such duties of tonnage.
