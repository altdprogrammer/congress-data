    "text": "Trade Procedures Simplification Act of 1980 - Requires the Attorney General, in consultation with other Federal agency heads, to determine whether: (1) U.S. business conduct and arrangements to expand exports in various countries conflict with basic antitrust principles; and (2) a more liberal enforcement policy for overseas activities would impede implementation of the antitrust laws. Directs the Attorney General to identify conduct and arrangements associated with particular types of export sales which the Attorney General determines would not warrant prosecution under the antitrust laws. Sets forth the procedures for describing such permissible conduct and disclosing such descriptions. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to intervene in such suits and to provide legal assistance to exporters. Prohibits prosecution under the antitrust laws of exporters who: (1) have notified the Attorney General of their intention to engage in such designated permissible conduct; or (2) receive an approval, or no objection, from the Attorney General concerning proposed transactions. Requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress concerning implementation of this Act."
