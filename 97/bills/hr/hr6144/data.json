    "text": "Prohibits for two years after enactment of this Act the issuance of a permit pursuant to title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 that authorizes ocean dumping of low-level radioactive waste unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency finds that: (1) the proposed dumping is necessary to conduct research related to ocean dumping; (2) the dumping will have minimal adverse impact upon human health, welfare, and amenities and the marine environment, ecological systems, economic potentialities, and other legitimate uses; (3) the potential benefits of the research will outweigh any adverse impact; and (4) the proposed dumping will be preceded by baseline monitoring studies of the proposed dumping site and its surrounding environment. Provides that after the end of the two-year period, the Administrator may not issue a permit for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste in the ocean until the applicant, in addition to complying with the requirements under title I of such Act, prepares a radioactive material disposal impact assessment with respect to the site at which the disposal is proposed. Requires the Administrator to submit a copy of any such assessment to specified congressional committees. Makes such a permit effective 45 days after it is issued unless either House of Congress disapproves it by resolution within such time period."
