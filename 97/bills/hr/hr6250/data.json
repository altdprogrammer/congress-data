    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 97-538) Community Renewal Employment Act - Declares the purpose of this Act to be the provision of employment opportunities to long-term unemployed individuals in high unemployment areas through grants for labor and related costs associated with the repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of essential community facilities and for public safety and health activities. Makes eligible areas for such program any local government with a population of 50,000 or more, any county or equivalent political subdivision, or any concentrated employment program grantee area which has: (1) an average unemployment rate greater than the national average for the preceding three months; or (2) experienced a sudden and severe economic dislocation as determined by the Secretary of Labor. Makes eligible recipients of grant funds, under specified circumstances: (1) States; (2) local governments; (3) consortia of local governments; (4) existing concentrated employment program grantees serving rural areas under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act; and (5) Native American Indian, Alaska Native, and Oklahoma Indian groups. Makes individuals eligible to participate in such program only if they are unemployed at the time of eligibility determination and for at least 15 of the 26 weeks prior to such determination, with specified exceptions. Limits wages for eligible individuals to 52 weeks in a two-year period. Requires that priority be given to those who have exhausted unemployment insurance benefits and those who have been unemployed for the longest periods immediately preceding selection. Sets forth provisions for the allocation of the amount appropriated to carry out this Act in any fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to reserve two percent of such amount to provide funds to Native American Indian, Alaska Native, and Oklahoma Indian groups. Directs the Secretary to reserve 25 percent of the remainder of such amount for discretionary allocation to eligible recipients serving areas of high unemployment or designated enterprise zones, or areas affected by mass layoffs, natural disasters, or Government actions such as relocation of Federal facilities. Directs the Secretary to allocate the remainder of such amount among the States on the basis of: (1) the relative number of unemployed residents; (2) the relative \"excess number\" (above four and one-half percent of the labor force) of unemployed persons; and (3) the relative number of residents unemployed for 15 weeks or more. Sets forth application procedures which eligible recipients must follow. Directs the Secretary to give priority to applications according to specified criteria. Requires eligible recipients to enter into suitable arrangements with the State employment security agency for screening and referral of eligible participants. Limits to 25 percent that portion of the funds provided to any eligible recipient for any fiscal year which may be used for administrative and equipment costs. Requires that the remainder of such funds be used only to provide wages and related employment benefits to eligible participants. Sets forth general requirements relating to use of funds for employment under this Act. Limits the number of subsidized jobs to five percent of the work force of an eligible recipient, with specified exceptions. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations to assure appropriate coordination with labor market information programs at Federal, State, and local levels. Sets forth standards relating to employment under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1987."
