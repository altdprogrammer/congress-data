Extends the scope of such offense to include: (1) using or carrying a firearm during commission of any felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction; or (2) using or carrying illegally any firearm, transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, during commission of any crime punishable by more than one year's imprisonment. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to ten years to life imprisonment for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the directions, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or grant probation and that the additional sentence not run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the offense itself."
