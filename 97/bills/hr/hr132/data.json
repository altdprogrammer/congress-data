Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide for the location, salvage, restoration, and preservation of such ships to the extent and in the manner the Secretary deems advisable. Authorizes a State to acquire shipwrecks lying beneath the navigable waters within the boundaries of such State if it has developed a plan for the location, protection, salvage, and restoration of such wrecks which meets the requirements set forth in this Act. Limits the power of a State to acquire a right, title, or interest in any shipwreck from the United States should the Secretary order or contract for its salvage before such a plan is adopted. Permits the modification of a State plan with the approval of the Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary of the Army from exercising his authority to break up, remove, sell, or otherwise dispose of such vessels without the prior approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Provides civil penalties for individuals found to be in violation of this Act. Terminates all right, title, and interest of a State in and to each shipwreck acquired by that State pursuant to this Act should the Secretary determine that State is not in compliance with its plan."
