    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Ways and Means with amendment, H. Rept. 97-510) Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1982 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reinstate through 1983, and revise the rates of, the taxes on fuels used in noncommercial aviation. Reduces the airline ticket tax for individual travel from eight to five percent. Reinstates through 1983, and increases the rate of, the tax on the use of international travel facilities. Reinstates through 1983 the tax on transportation of property by air. Revises the definition of \"taxable transportation\" to: (1) alter the determination of whether air travel is \"uninterrupted international air transportation;\" and (2) authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to waive the \"225-mile zone\" provisions applicable to travel in Canada or Mexico. Repeals the tax on the use of civil aircraft (terminated October 1, 1980). Revises the manner for showing on airline tickets the amounts paid for transportation and imposed as taxes. Re-establishes in the Treasury the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Appropriates to the Trust Fund amounts equivalent to the revenues received after June 30, 1982, and before January 1, 1984 from the taxes on aviation fuel, air transportation, gasoline used in aircraft, and aircraft tires and tubes and additional revenues as may be required. Makes amounts in the Trust Fund available, as provided by appropriation Acts, for making expenditures before October 1, 1983, to meet obligations of the United States incurred for airport and airway development purposes, including aviation noise abatement, air traffic control services, and Department of Transportation administrative expenses. Provides for the transfer from the Trust Fund to the general fund of the Treasury of amounts equivalent to: (1) refunds of tax made after June 30, 1982, and before January 1, 1984, on: (A) gasoline used on farms; (B) gasoline used for certain nonhighway purposes; or (C) fuel not used for taxable purposes; and (2) tax credits with respect to such fuels and lubricating oil used for certain nontaxable purposes. Requires the transfer of the amounts appropriated to the Trust Fund at least quarterly. Repeals the provision which established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund under the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970. Permits the U.S. Customs Service to charge aircraft owners or operators for certain overtime costs incurred in providing inspection or quarantine services."
