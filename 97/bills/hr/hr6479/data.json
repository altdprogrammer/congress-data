    "text": "Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1983 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to include in the definition of \"contribution\" donations made to draft clearly identified individuals to become candidates for Federal office. Exempts from the definition of contributions any donations to political parties or committees designated to defray establishment, administration, or solicitation costs of the Committee. Requires that these donations be reported on a semiannual basis. Extends to the national committee of a political party certain exemptions that are given to State committees. Requires that reports filed under this Act be filed only with the Federal Election Commission (Commission). States that a principal campaign committee terminates automatically three years after the date of the last election (except in the case of a presidential candidate eligible for payments from tax deductible contributions to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund). Eliminates the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate as ex-officio members of the Commission. Allows a political committee of a party to utilize the expedited procedure for advisory opinion requests during the 60-day period before an election. Requires the Commission to establish time limits for investigations. Revises the investigatory procedures of the Commission. Deletes the requirement that the Court of Appeals sit en banc when hearing cases involving the constitutionality of the Act. Requires the Commission to make available to the public reports and statements filed with it, following regularly scheduled elections. Requires committees other than authorized committees to file in the State in which they are headquartered. Increases the contribution limitations for certain offices. Permits a separate segregated fund to solicit contributions from another separate segregated fund. Amends the definition for \"stockholder\" for purposes of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Permits political committees of political parties to engage in bona fide commercial transactions in order to defray establishment, administration, and solicitation costs. Repeals authority for the voting system study. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide the opportunity for a presidential general election candidate to request a hearing before the Commission if a demand for repayment of funds is made available."
