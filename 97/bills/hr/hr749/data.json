Authorizes a Federal agency attempting to collect a claim under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 to notify a consumer reporting agency that a person is responsible for a claim if the Federal agency has sent two written notices informing the person that a consumer reporting agency will be notified and the person has not agreed to pay the claim or filed for a review of the claim. Requires a Federal agency, before notifying a consumer reporting agency, to have: (1) provided, if requested, a review of the claim; and (2) obtained assurances that the consumer reporting agency complies with Federal laws governing the provision of consumer credit information. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish regulations requiring agencies to submit annual reports on loan collection activities. Requires the Director to report annually to the Congress on the management of agency loan collection activities."
