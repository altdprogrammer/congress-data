    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-05-13", 
    "text": "Wilderness Preservation Act of 1982 - Withdraws the following lands from appropriation under the mining laws, from disposition under oil and gas, mineral, and geothermal leasing laws, and from energy and mineral exploration and development activities: (1) lands designated as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System; (2) congressionally designated wilderness study areas; (3) lands recommended for wilderness designation by the Forest Service in the second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II) program; and (4) lands identified as wilderness study areas by the Bureau of Land Management. Authorizes the President to transmit to Congress a recommendation that lands withdrawn by this Act be opened to mineral exploration, development, or extraction if there is a national need for such mineral activities. Makes such a recommendation effective only upon enactment by Congress of a joint resolution approving such recommendation within 120 days of continuous session of Congress after its receipt. Permits activities compatible with the preservation of the wilderness environment for the purpose of inventorying energy, mineral, and other resource values in areas withdrawn by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to prevent the disclosure of confidential, privileged, or proprietary information obtained under this Act. Exempts from withdrawal pursuant to this Act: (1) national forest system or Bureau of Land Management lands released from wilderness study to management for nonwilderness uses; (2) specified national forest system lands designated as congressional wilderness study areas; and (3) lands designated as conservation units under the Alaska National Interests Lands Conservation Act, where such Act is inconsistent with this Act. Permits drilling, exploration, development, and resource extraction activities which do not require occupancy of the surface to be conducted on lands withdrawn pursuant to this Act or the Wilderness Act. Subjects provisions of this Act to valid existing rights (including mining claims, leases, and permits) established before the date of this Act. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to manage lands recommended for wilderness designation so as not to impair their suitability for preservation as wilderness until Congress designates such lands as wilderness or the President recommends that such areas be released from wilderness study status. Provides for lands recommended for wilderness but not designated as wilderness within two years to be released for management by the Secretary for nonwilderness uses. Prohibits judicial and administrative review of the RARE II final environmental statement dated January 4, 1979. Provides for the following lands to be released for management for nonwilderness uses: (1) national forest system lands reviewed under the RARE II program but not recommended for wilderness or identified for further planning; (2) national forest system lands recommended for wilderness in the RARE II statement but not designated as wilderness by Congress by January 1, 1985; and (3) national forest system lands in the RARE II further planning classification not recommended for wilderness by September 30, 1985, or recommended for wilderness but not designated as wilderness by Congress by January 1, 1988. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide, regional, or national roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands to determine their suitability as wilderness without express congressional authorization. States that the designation of any wilderness area shall not lead to the creation of buffer zones around such area. Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to report jointly to the President every five years on the energy and mineral potential of areas withdrawn under this Act. Directs the President to report to Congress on such matters."
