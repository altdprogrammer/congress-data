    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-05-20", 
    "text": "Veterans' Employment Assistance Act of 1982 - Extends eligibility for the employment and training of disabled and Vietnam-era veterans' programs to include a veteran rated at any level of disability, rather than only those rated 30 percent or more disabled. Continues the 30 percent or more disabled requirement for purposes of giving preference in employment as veterans' benefits counselors and veterans' claims examiners. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment to promulgate regulations to administer such program. Requires that eligible veterans and persons be given priority in the provision of employment and training services. Makes officials within the Department of Labor who help administer this program responsible to the Assistant Secretary. Changes the position of State veterans' employment representative to that of State veterans' employment director. Assigns to each regional office of the Assistant Secretary a regional director for veterans' employment. Makes such directors functionally responsible for supervising the participation of veterans in Federal employment and training programs, job listings, discrimination complaints, and other specified duties. Requires that funds used to assist States in administering the disabled veterans' outreach program be specifically set forth in appropriation Acts. Permits a waiver of limitation on the percentage of outreach specialists which shall be stationed at local employment service offices in a State. Requires outreach specialists to develop programs with the Veterans Administration vocational rehabilitation staff and others to assure maximum assistance to veterans. Directs the Assistant Secretary to monitor the employment of such specialists. Directs the Secretary of Labor to estimate the funds necessary for the administration of the employment training and reemployment rights programs, including the amounts necessary to fund the disabled veterans' outreach program specialists programs. Requires the Secretary's annual report to include a report on activities under such program. Directs the Secretary, through the Assistant Secretary, to establish a program providing job counseling, training, and placement services for veterans through grants to State agencies and private, nonprofit organizations. Encourages such agencies to make cooperative arrangements with industry. Directs the Secretary to coordinate this program with other veterans' job training programs and to determine the effectiveness of an agency in providing services under this program. Permits the Secretary to furnish technical assistance as necessary. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Veterans' Affairs Committees of Congress on the conduct of this program. Establishes within the Department of Labor the Secretary's Committee on Veterans' Affairs to meet quarterly to bring veterans' employment problems to the attention of the Secretary. Extends eligibility for the employment and training programs for disabled and Vietnam-era veterans to include persons who, but for the receipt of military retired pay, would be eligible to receive compensation. Requires each Federal contractor who must take affirmative action to employ such veterans to make quarterly reports on the number and characteristics of new hires with the state veterans' employment director. Requires each Federal department and agency to list openings with a local employment service office, which shall give veterans priority in referral. Requires the Office of Personnel Management to publish a report which includes the number of openings and the number of veterans who were referred to and/or received a job. Requires employers of a person called to perform active duty for training or inactive duty training in the armed forces to grant such person a leave of absence for up to 12 months. Repeals the exemplary rehabilitation certificates program."
