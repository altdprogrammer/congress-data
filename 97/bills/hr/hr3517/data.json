    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Virgin Islands Nonimmigrant Alien Adjustment Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Attorney General to adjust to permanent resident status alien workers and their dependents who have resided continuously in the Virgin Islands since June 30, 1975, if: (1) application for such adjustment is made within one year; (2) such persons were physically present in the Virgin Islands at the time of such filing; and (3) the worker is otherwise admissible as an immigrant. States that such status adjustments shall not reduce the number of available total or national immigrant visas. Authorizes the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the Virgin Islands, to limit the number of second preference immigrant visas issued to spouses or unmarried sons or daughters of aliens adjusted under this Act. Prohibits fourth (married sons or daughters) or fifth (brothers or sisters) preference immigrant petitions from being filed by aliens adjusted under this Act unless a case of extreme hardship exists. Prohibits the admission of alien workers to perform temporary labor in the Virgin Islands (except athletes and entertainers for limited stays). Directs the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and the Interior, and the Attorney General, in consultation with officials of the Virgin Islands, to assess the social and economic impact of this Act on the Virgin Islands and to report to the President and Congress within one year."
