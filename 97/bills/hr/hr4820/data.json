    "text": "Repeals certain Federal provisions dealing with the compensation of U.S. Customs Service employees. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to set new compensation rates for Customs Service employees performing specified inspection services. Limits overtime pay for such work to one and one-half times the employee's hourly rate. Prohibits premium pay if payment would cause the employee's total annual pay to exceed a specified amount. Makes the new compensation rates the exclusive compensation provisions for such inspection services. Requires the master, owner, or agent of an aircraft, vessel, or vehicle who requests or requires overtime, Sunday, or holiday inspection services to reimburse the government for all compensation paid for such services. Requires reimbursement for any employee who reported for duty even if the actual inspection did not take place. Requires such master, owner, or agent to obtain a special license for unlading or lading during overtime, Sunday, or holiday hours. Requires such person to provide a deposit or bond covering employee compensation before such license will be granted. Exempts from the reimbursement and deposit provisions: (1) the owner, operator, or agent of a highway vehicle, tunnel, or ferry between the United States and Canada or between the United States and Mexico; and (2) the lading or unlading of merchandise, baggage, or persons arriving in or departing from the United States by highway, bridge, tunnel, or ferry."
