    "text": "Incentive Pay Amendments of 1982 - Requires the Office of Personnel Management to establish a performance bonus system for Federal employees in GS-13 through GS-15 positions. Uses performance appraisals as the basis for determining performance bonuses. Sets the minimum bonus at two percent of an employee's annual pay and the maximum bonus at $10,000. States that such annual bonuses shall: (1) be in addition to the employee's basic pay; and (2) not be considered to be equivalent to a periodic step increase in pay. Sets forth the method of determining whether to award performance bonuses. States that acceptance of the bonus precludes the employee from using the idea for which the bonus was given as the basis for a claim against the Government. Provides for the funding of the performance bonus system."
