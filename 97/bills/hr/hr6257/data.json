Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe tax tables with a maximum reduction of the tax liability of $700 in 1982 and $1,400 in 1983. Amends the Ecnomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 to delay the repeal of the maximum tax on personal service income and the reduction in the alternative minimum tax, and the personal holding company tax until 1984. Reinstates the 28 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains, effective 1982. Repeals provisions for the indexation of individual income tax rates and of deductions for personal exemptions. Reduces the deduction for net capital gain from 60 to 50 percent. Provides for a corresponding reduction of the charitable deduction for contributions of capital gain property.

Title III: Estate and Gift Tax Provisions - Revises the carryover basis rules for property acquired from a decedent by restoring prior law which provided that beneficiaries receiving property from a decedent's estate retain the decedent's basis in the property. Repeals the increase in the unified credit against the estate and gift taxes and the reduction in the maximum rates of estate and gift tax which were enacted by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.
