    "text": "National Land Resources Act of 1981 - Declares that topsoil is a valuable natural resource upon which future generations will be dependent. Declares that ownership of land carries with it a responsibility to keep the topsoil accessible for use at a later date. Establishes a National Land Resources Protection Commission. Directs the Commission to establish standards with respect to the stockpiling and replacing of topsoil on all: (1) federally assisted projects, including highways; (2) projects on federally held land; and (3) projects which affect interstate commerce. Prescribes minimum criteria to be included in such standards. Directs the Commission to establish minimum standards to assure that projects covered by this Act will not cause pollution of existing streams, land slides, flooding, or substantial changes in the volume of water to be carried by adjacent waterways except where such change is consistent with State or Federal water resource policy. States that no dirt shall be moved on any project where the moving or covering of topsoil covers an area in excess of 100,000 square feet until a license or letter has been issued by the Commission or by a commission to whom authority has been delegated under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for the administration of this Act."
