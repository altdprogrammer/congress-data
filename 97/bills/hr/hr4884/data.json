    "text": "National Apprenticeship Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends an Act (popularly known as the National Apprenticeship Act) to provide that such Act may be cited as the \"National Apprenticeship Act.\" Establishes a national apprenticeship and training system. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) establish labor standards for apprenticeship and training; (2) encourage establishment of structured on-the-job, journey person level, and entry level training programs; (3) award credentials for apprenticeship programs conforming to the Secretary's standards; and (4) assist State apprenticeship agencies in uniform nationwide application of the Secretary's standards, related policies, and regulations. Directs the Secretary, through the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training established by this Act, to provide, without remuneration, technical assistance and advisory services to industry in determining training needs, developing training plans, and establishing and conducting systematic training programs for employed workers. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish, according to specified criteria, procedures for registration of programs and apprentices; and (2) arrange for the collection and periodic publication of information on State and federally registered programs and apprentices. Directs the Secretary to use specified funds to: (1) supplement apprenticeship activities of designated cooperating State apprenticeship agencies; and (2) provide discretionary support for specified activities of such agencies. Sets forth requirements which States must fulfill to receive such assistance. Requires that Federal contracts for which total compensation equals or exceeds $5,000,000 contain provisions for apprenticeship programs. Directs the Secretary to periodically review the needs for skilled workers in defense related industries. Authorizes the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and industry and labor representatives, to reduce, without the consent of the Congress, to not less than $1,000,000, the amount which triggers the Federal contract apprenticeship provision requirement. Directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, in cooperation with the Secretary, to periodically survey the extent of employment in apprenticeable occupations within the Federal Government and to identify situations where appropriate apprenticeship should be initiated. Directs Federal agencies employing persons in apprenticeable occupations to submit annual reports to the Secretary and the Director. Requires that, beginning 12 months after enactment of this Act, apprentices and other workers in structured training programs substantially conforming to apprenticeship criteria employed by the Federal Government shall be employed only in programs registered by the Secretary in accordance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to use specified funds to provide research, information exchange, technical assistance, and promotional aids for apprenticeship staffs and program sponsors. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, within 90 days after the end of each year after enactment of this Act, on the general status of apprenticeship, with specified emphases and recommendations. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a program of special demonstration assistance for apprenticeship training in skills peculiarly entwined with the historical development of the United States. Permits the Secretary, for this purpose, to use specified funds and to waive normally applicable registration requirements. Establishes the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, in the Department of Labor, to carry out this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Bureau to report directly to the Secretary. Transfers to the Bureau functions of the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training Administration relating to apprenticeship. Sets forth national apprenticeship program provisions relating to: (1) legal authority; (2) acceptance of gifts; (3) utilization of services and facilities; (4) interstate agreements; (5) prohibitions against political activities; (6) nondiscrimination; and (7) records, audits, and reports. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress activities undertaken pursuant to such Act. Authorizes appropriations in necessary amounts for each fiscal year to carry out such Act."
