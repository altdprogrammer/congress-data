    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on the District of Columbia with amendment, H. Rept. 97-219) District of Columbia Bond Authorization Act of 1981 - Authorizes the District of Columbia to issue general obligation bonds to: (1) pay eligible liabilities; (2) reimburse the District of Columbia for paying specified eligible liabilities; (3) pay costs incidental to such bond issuance; and (4) fund a debt service reserve fund. Requires the District of Columbia Council to authorize the issuance of such bonds. Requires such authorization to include a payment financing plan for such bonds. Authorizes the Council to provide for a reasonably required debt service reserve fund. Makes a Council authorization of bond issuance effective upon enactment without the Congressional layover ordinarily required by the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (the Home Rule Act). Limits the aggregate principal amount of such bond issuance. Specifies which provisions of the Home Rule Act will apply to the bond issuance. Authorizes the District of Columbia to reserve the right to redeem before maturity any bond issued under this Act. Directs the Mayor of the District of Columbia to publish notice of any bond issuance authorized by the Council. Provides for a 20 day period between publication of notice of a bond issuance and issuance of the bonds by the Mayor. Provides that after such 20 day period: (1) any recital or statement of fact in the Bond Act shall be deemed true; (2) such Bond Act shall be conclusively presumed to be valid; and (3) no proceeding questioning the validity of the Bond Act may be commenced. Sets forth the method of issuing, paying and executing such bonds. Requires that bond proceeds be segregated from other District funds and expended solely for authorized purposes. Sets forth requirements covering investment of bond proceeds, withdrawal of bond proceeds, and records of transactions involving bond proceeds. Directs the Mayor to report annually to Congress on the use of bond proceeds and on the payment of such bonds' principal and interest. Secures such bonds by the full faith and credit of the District of Columbia but not by the full faith and credit of the United States. Authorizes the Council to pledge District revenues and additional security for such bonds. Sets forth the contents of any Act pledging District revenues. Authorizes the sale of bonds secured by such revenues at either public or private sales."
