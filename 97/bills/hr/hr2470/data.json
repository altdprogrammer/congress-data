Extends the scope of such offense to include displaying or offering to use a firearm or a destructive device. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to not less than ten years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and not less than 25 years for a second or subsequent offense (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or impose concurrent sentences. Eliminates the prohibition against granting probation."
