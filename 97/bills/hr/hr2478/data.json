    "text": "Title I: Quantitative Limitations on the Importation of Automobiles - Limits the total number of automobiles produced by each automobile manufacturer that may be imported into the United States during calendar years 1981-1983. Bases the total number upon the number of automobiles imported in 1979. Specifies decreases in the number of automobiles that may be imported after 1983. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to compute and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the total number of automobiles produced by each manufacturer that may be imported each year. Exempts automobiles produced in Canada from such quotas. Title II: Restrictions on the Domestic Sale of Automobiles - Prohibits the domestic sale or distribution of a nondomestically manufactured automobile by any domestic automobile manufacturers. Specifies the percentage of cost to such manufacturer that must be attributable to value added in the United States and Canada during model years 1983-1985 in order for an automobile to be considered domestically manufactured. Exempts automobiles imported in accordance with the quotas set forth in title I from such prohibition. Sets forth penalties for violations of this title."
