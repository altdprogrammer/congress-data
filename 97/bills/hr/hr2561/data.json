    "text": "National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Amendments of 1981 - Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to extend through fiscal year 1981 the authorization of appropriations for research grants in the food and agricultural sciences. Increases from five years to ten years the terms of the Joint Council on Food and Agricultural Sciences and of the National Agricultural Research and Extension Users Advisory Board. Sets the minimum membership of the Joint Council at 25, with each member appointed for a three-year term. Raises the membership of the Advisory Board from 21 to 25. Revises the annual deadlines for certain Advisory Board reports. Replaces the emphasis of Joint Council policy from a unified national program to coordination with existing State cooperative institutions, especially land-grant colleges and universities, including the Tuskegee Institute. Authorizes the Secretary to establish cooperative human nutrition centers at such institutions. Directs the President to appoint an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for the administration of such research grant programs. Specifies areas of high priority research. Makes research foundations established by land-grant colleges and universities eligible for special grants. Prescribes a ten percent allocation of facilities grants to cooperating forestry schools. Increases to $40,000,000, with an extension through fiscal year 1987, the authorization for research grants for agricultural chemicals, alcohol and other forms of biomass energy, and industrial hydrocarbons. Increases from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 the maximum amount of such grant money that may be awarded to the colleges and universities of any one State. Increases from $15,000,000 to $35,000,000 the annual authorization for research in national or regional animal health or disease problems. Directs the Secretary to establish annual priority lists of animal health and disease problems of national or regional significance. Exempts funds made available under established Federal-State partnership arrangements from reduction for indirect costs incurred by the recipient involved. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and implement a cooperative research and extension aquaculture program, including matching grants (not to exceed $50,000 per State). Establishes within the Department of Agriculture an Aquaculture Advisory Board to advise the Secretary with respect to such research program. Authorizes appropriations for such program. Amends the McIntire-Stennis Act of 1962 to direct the Secretary to appoint a council of at least 16 members to give representation to Federal and State agencies concerned with the development and utilization of the Nation's forest resources. Prescribes the allocation to food and agricultural research of appropriations earmarked for promotion of exportation and domestic consumption of agricultural products. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to exempt from the general prohibition against furnishing excess Federal personal property to grantees any property furnished by the Secretary to: (1) State and county extension services engaged in cooperative agricultural extension work; (2) State agricultural experiment stations; or (3) land-grant colleges and universities."
