Rept. 97-342) Department of Energy National Security and Military Applications of Nuclear Energy Authorization Act of 1982 - Title I: National Security Programs - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to the Department of Energy for operating expenses and plant and capital equipment costs incurred in carrying out national security programs, including scientific research and development, strategic and critical materials necessary for common defense, and military applications of nuclear energy, as specified. Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of authorized funds for programs which have not been presented to or requested of Congress unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to all the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement as specified. Imposes specified limits on the cost and cost overruns of general plant projects and construction projects. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Federal agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for proposed construction projects with amounts authorized for plant engineering and design, and to perform such services using available funds for any Department of Energy defense activity construction project in the event of any national emergency. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Secretary of Energy to prescribe regulations prohibiting the dissemination of specific unclassified information concerning atomic energy defense programs which could have a significant adverse affect on the health, safety, and security of the public. Directs the Secretary to prepare a quarterly report detailing the application of such guidelines. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to grant the power of arrest to employees authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry firearms for security reasons in the discharge of their official duties. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for the preparation of an environmental impact statement concerning the operation of any defense facility of the Department of Energy unless such statement is already in process or is required by law. Directs the President to report to the appropriate committees of Congress by June 30, 1983, on plans for the permanent disposal of high-level and transuranic wastes resulting from atomic energy defense activities."
