Prohibits the purchase of a savings certificate by an individual or family more than once during a calendar year. Entitles an individual with an adjusted gross income of less than $15,000 who invests, during any calendar year, a lump sum of $500 for a term of not less than seven years and any family with an adjusted gross income of less than $30,000 which invests a lump sum of $1,000 to a bonus. Sets the amount of such bonus payment at 14 percent of the original investment amount. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to reimburse a financial institution for all bonus payments. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act."
