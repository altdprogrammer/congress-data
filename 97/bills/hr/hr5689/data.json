    "text": "Civil Rights Act of 1982 - Title I: Equal Opportunity Provisions - Establishes uniform procedures for the enforcement by the Federal Government of civil rights laws, including title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and numerous other discrimination laws and provisions. Continues to authorize individual Federal agencies to investigate, attempt to resolve, and monitor compliance with regard to discrimination complaints, but otherwise centralizes enforcement authority in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Attorney General. Permits an individual to bring a civil action directly in Federal court for an alleged act of discrimination. Requires an investigative agency to seek to develop a voluntary compliance agreement by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring civil actions in court for patterns or practices of unlawful discrimination. Prohibits a Federal agency from issuing any regulation with regard to employment discrimination without the prior approval of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Prohibits any Federal agency and the Commission from issuing any regulation without the approval of the Attorney General. Establishes a one-House congressional veto procedure for regulations under this Act issued by any Federal agency, the Commission, and the Attorney General. Makes any such regulation effective 45 days after its transmittal to Congress if it is not disapproved. Continues generally an \"effects\" standard for proving discrimination, but requires the effect to be \"reasonably foreseeable\" with regard to certain discriminatory acts, including denial of Federal benefits. Title II: Administrative Provisions - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to determine which personnel employed in connection with functions affected by this Act shall be transferred to the Department of Justice and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
