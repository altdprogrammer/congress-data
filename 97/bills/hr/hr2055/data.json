Prohibits the imposition of a noncompliance penalty under the Clean Air Act upon an owner or operator with a compliance date extension provided their stationary source remains in compliance with all the requirements of such extension. Makes available to the public all information obtained by the Administrator under this Act, subject to a specified exception. States that revision of a State implementation plan is not required because a compliance date extension has been granted if such plan would have met Clean Air Act requirements prior to the granting of such extension."
