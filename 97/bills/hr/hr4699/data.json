Disallows a fair market value deduction for a contribution of property which was produced while the taxpayer was a Government officer or employee if such property arose out of the performance of the taxpayer's duties. Permits the executor of an estate, in calculating the gross estate, to elect to value any copyright or any literary, musical, or artistic work created by the decedent at an amount equal to the decedent's adjusted basis in such property."
