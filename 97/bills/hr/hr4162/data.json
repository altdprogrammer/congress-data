    "text": "Immigration Improvements Act of 1981 - Title I: Change in Numerical Limitations and Entry of Aliens into the United States - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the President to submit an annual immigration plan to the Congress. Sets forth congressional procedures for considering such plan. Establishes an overall annual immigration numerical limitation. Breaks it down into categories of immediate relatives, refugees, and other immigrants. Makes corresponding limitation changes in current refugee and immigrant admissions. Revises emergency situation refugee admissions provisions. Requires brothers or sisters of U.S. citizens to be unmarried to qualify for fifth preference immigration priority. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) prepare contingency plans for processing large groups of asylum applicants illegally in the United States; and (2) file quarterly admissions reports with the Congress. Title II: Improved Enforcement - Directs the Attorney General to disregard work experience gained while illegally in the United States when considering an alien's visa application. Makes it unlawful to hire an illegal alien. Provides civil penalties for employer violations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude illegal aliens from eligibility for the earned income tax credit. Disallows a deduction for compensation paid to such persons. Authorizes the Attorney General to enter into agreements with State and local law enforcement agencies to help apprehend escaped aliens. Directs the Attorney General to submit a plan to the Congress for expanding and upgrading the border patrol. Makes an alien excludable or deportable for knowingly smuggling illegal aliens into the United States (currently an alien must have done so \"knowingly and for gain\"). Places the burden of proof in deportation proceedings on the Attorney General. Amends the Social Security Act to limit AFDC and Medicaid benefits to citizens and permanent residents. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Attorney General to prescribe a uniform fee schedule."
