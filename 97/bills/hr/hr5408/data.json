Prohibits SBA loans in excess of: (1) $300,000 for each disaster where the borrower is an individual; and (2) $500,000 for each disaster where the borrower is not an individual. Permits the SBA to waive the $500,000 limitation if the loan applicant is a major source of employment in an area suffering a disaster."
