Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a national strategic minerals and materials assessment program within the Department, utilizing the framework and personnel of the uranium program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate and evaluate the activities of the Federal Government; (2) classify the areas of potential strategic material and mineral deposits on public lands; (3) periodically review strategic materials and minerals issues; and (4) establish an early warning system to monitor supply and demand for such materials and minerals. Directs the Secretary to continually assess the materials and minerals on public lands in a manner not injurious to the habitat. States that nothing in this Act preempts any provision of the Wilderness Act or the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act except that the Secretary may initiate strategic materials and minerals assessments on public lands withdrawn from mineral entry to the extent such assessments can be accomplished with minimal surface disturbance."
