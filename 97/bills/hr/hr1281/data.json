Provides that the Secretary shall not convey any land under this Act until the State of Alaska conveys to the United States all right, title, and interest in lands included in such claim which have been selected under the Alaska Statehood Act of July 7, 1958. Requires the State to warrant that such selected lands have not been conveyed to a third party."
