    "text": "Former Prisoner-of-War Omnibus Act of 1981 - Establishes a presumption of dietary deficiency, deprivation, and dehumanization in violation of the Geneva Conventions for any veteran held captive as a prisoner of war during active military service in World War I, World War II, the Korean conflict, or the Vietnam era. Expands disability entitlement to captivity-induced or aggravated disabilities for any former prisoner of war suffering from any disease associated with nutritional deficiencies, any chronic disease with a gradual onset, and psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, which have become manifest to a ratable degree. Entitles all veterans who have been POW's to: (1) psychological readjustment counseling and rehabilitation services; (2) hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care; (3) outpatient dental services; (4) medical services for any disability on an outpatient or ambulatory basis; and (5) vocational rehabilitation. Directs the Administrator to establish an advisory committee to assess new medical and other information on former POW's and to advise the Administrator on procedures affecting such veterans. Requires the committee to consist of former prisoners of war and representatives of specified medical fields. Requires the committee to report biennially to the Administrator on its activities."
