    "text": "Research and Development Authorization Estimates Act - Amends the Presidential Science and Technology Advisory Organization Act of 1976 to require the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to advise the President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget every other fiscal year in preparing an estimate of the appropriate funding levels for research and development for each Federal department, agency and instrumentality for at least that and the following fiscal years. Requires the Office to identify and describe situations and conditions which warrant special attention within the next four years, rather than the next five years as is now required. Requires the Director to consult with the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology concerning programs and responsibilities relating to the problems, constraints, and opportunities so identified. Repeals the requirement for the President to submit an annual Science and Technology Report to Congress. Requires the Office to study on a continuing basis the impact of inflation on the conduct of federally-supported research and development."
