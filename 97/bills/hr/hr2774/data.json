    "text": "Public Telecommunications Act of 1981 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to restructure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Declares the policy of Congress to be the encouragement and support of public audio and video programs, however delivered, rather than public telecommunications. Reduces the membership on the Board of Directors from 15 to six. Makes the President of the Corporation Chairman of the Board. Reduces the term of office of each member from six to five years. Requires meetings of the Board to take place in Washington, D.C. Increases the rate of daily compensation but places a ceiling on the amount of compensation any member may receive in any one fiscal year. Authorizes the Corporation to facilitate the availability of public audio and video programs through other entities as well as through public telecommunications entities on a noncommercial, nonprofit, or sustaining basis. Grants access to space satellite interconnection facilities or services for the transmission of public audio and video programs. Extends the authorization of appropriations to the Public Broadcasting Fund from fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 1986. Eliminates the limitations on the authorizations for fiscal years 1981- 1983. Excludes non-Federal financial support received by a public broadcast entity for purposes of determining the amount of each authorization. Reformulates the percentage of funds disbursed by the Corporation among the licensees and permittees of public television and radio stations for fiscal years 1982, 1983 and for each subsequent fiscal year. Directs the Corporation to establish an annual budget of appropriated monies to make grants and contracts for the production and acquisition of public audio and video programs, excluding interconnection facilities and operations and engineering and program-related research. Requires such budget, for fiscal years 1981-1986, to consist of not less than 95 percent of the monies in the Fund. Limits for fiscal years 1981-1986 the percentage of funds the Corporation may expend for other activities. Requires the concurrence of the public television and radio licensees when the Corporation reviews the percentage of funds reserved for programming purposes. Limits the amount of any one program grant for fiscal year 1983 and subsequent fiscal years. Requires each public telecommunications entity receiving funds from the Corporation to undergo a biannual rather than an annual audit. Authorizes each public broadcast licensee to broadcast institutional advertising announcements. Limits such broadcasting to the beginning or end of regular programing and to 30 seconds duration."
