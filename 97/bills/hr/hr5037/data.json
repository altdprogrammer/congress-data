Requires the President to determine that the silver authorized for disposal is in excess of the requirements of the stockpile as of September 1, 1982. Sets forth the factors the President should consider, including demand and the current reliability of supplies. Directs the President to notify the appropriate committees of Congress when he makes such a determination. Requires that excess silver be disposed of by minting bullion silver coins. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the appropriate committees of Congress before minting such coins. Requires that the proceeds from the sale of coins be covered into the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to authorize appropriations from the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund."
