Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1983 to carry out certain activities of the Maritime Administration. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 as may be necessary for increases in salary, retirement, or other employee benefits. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to allow a ship operator to elect to suspend its operating-differential subsidy contract (except those pertaining to the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service) under certain conditions."
