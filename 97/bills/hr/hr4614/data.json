    "text": "Debt Collection Act of 1981 - Makes the murder or manslaughter of a Federal debt collector a Federal offense. Allows the Government to collect claims by administrative offset beyond the six year statute of limitations on actions brought by the Government for money damages. Amends the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 to direct each agency to charge a minimum annual rate of interest on outstanding debts and to assess a penalty charge and handling costs on delinquent claims, except where another statute, statutorily mandated regulation, loan agreement, or contract either prohibits or explicitly fixes interest or penalty charges. Declares that service of legal process brought for the collection of United States claims shall be accomplished in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or as directed by the court. Authorizes the head of an agency to enter into a contract with any person for the collection of claims owed the United States. Requires any such contract to include provisions subjecting the contractor to the Privacy Act of 1974 and other applicable Federal and State laws governing debt collection."
