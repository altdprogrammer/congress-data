    "text": "Victim and Witness Protection and Assistance Act of 1982 - Amends the Federal criminal code to include in the presentence report of the defendant: (1) a statement of the harm done or loss suffered by the victim; (2) information on any available nonprison programs and resources; and (3) statements regarding the financial needs of the defendant and his dependents, the restitution needs of the victim and the amount of any gain derived from or loss caused by the criminal conduct of the defendant. Makes it a Federal offense punishable by a fine of not more than $250,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, for anyone to knowingly use force or threats to influence or intimidate a witness or informant. Makes it a Federal offense to retaliate against a witness or informant. Allows for a defendant found guilty of an offense to be sentenced to make restitution. Requires the Attorney General to develop and implement guidelines for the Department of Justice for the fair treatment of crime victims and witnesses in criminal cases. Directs the Attorney General to report to Congress, within one year of enactment of this Act, on the desirability of legislation concerning profit made by an individual from publicity of his criminal conduct."
