Includes arthritis, chronic respiratory conditions, frozen feet, and gastro intestinal disorders among those diseases for which a captivity-related presumption is extended for disability purposes. Eliminates the requirement that any psychiatric condition (psychoses) manifest itself within two years of separation from service to be considered captivity-related. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to furnish hospital or nursing home care to any veteran of World War I or World War II, the Korean conflict, or the Vietnam era who was held as a POW. Entitles such POW's to vocational rehabilitation."
