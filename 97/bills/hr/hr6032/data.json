    "text": "Nuclear Nonproliferation Policy Act of 1982 - Title I: Authorizations By the Secretary of Energy for Certain Activities Outside the United States - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require the publication in the Federal Register of authorizations for the production of special nuclear materials outside the United States. Provides that such an authorization will not become effective until at least 15 days after its publication. Makes authorizations for the production of special nuclear material outside the United States effective with respect to a non-nuclear-weapon state only if the Secretary of Energy determines that such state adheres to the criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports for peaceful uses. Requires the Secretary to publicly issue and submit to the President any recommendation for such an authorization with respect to a non-nuclear-weapon state which does not adhere to such criteria. Authorizes the President to allow such an authorization by executive order if withholding it would prejudice the achievement of U.S. nonproliferation objectives or jeopardize the common defense and security, unless Congress, after reviewing such an order, adopts a concurrent resolution opposing such order. Provides that conduct which results in the termination of U.S. nuclear exports to another nation shall result also in the suspension of authorizations for the production of special nuclear material in such nation. Requires specific authorizations by the Secretary to engage in the following activities outside the United States: (1) designing, constructing, or operating facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear material, for the production of heavy water, for the separation of isotopes from any source of special nuclear material, or for the fabrication of nuclear fuel containing plutonium; (2) designing, constructing, or furnishing equipment for use in any such facility; (3) training foreign personnel in such design, construction, or operation; (4) furnishing information not available to the public with respect to such design, construction, or operation; and (5) any other activities designated by the Secretary. Exempts from such requirement any such activity if: (1) it does not involve the communication of Restricted Data or classified defense information; (2) it is not in violation of other laws; or (3) it is limited either to participation in educational conferences, international conferences, or exchange programs or to furnishing of information which is available to the public. Authorizes the Secretary to require specific authorizations for activities carried out in designated countries or areas. Prohibits the Secretary from providing specific authorizations required under this Act unless Congress reviews the Secretary's reports on such authorizations and does not adopt a concurrent resolution opposing them. Title II: Exports of Highly Enriched Uranium - Authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue export licenses for highly enriched uranium for nuclear reactors only if: (1) there is no alternative nuclear reactor fuel available; (2) the proposed recipient of the uranium has indicated that it will use an alternative nuclear reactor fuel when one becomes available; and (3) the executive branch is developing an alternative nuclear reactor fuel. Requires the NRC to determine a kilogram limit on the amount of highly enriched uranium of U.S. origin that will be allowed at any one time in each foreign country and at each reactor site in each such country. Requires the NRC and the executive branch to support efforts to improve physical security arrangements for exports of highly enriched uranium. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan for the development of alternative nuclear reactor fuels for use in foreign reactors. Title III: Congressional Review of Subsequent Arrangements - Revises the time periods governing congressional review of subsequent arrangements for: (1) the retransfer of special nuclear material exported from the United States to a third country for reprocessing; (2) the reprocessing of any such material; or (3) the subsequent retransfer of plutonium in quantities greater than 500 grams resulting from the reprocessing of any such materials. Provides for congressional veto of such arrangements by concurrent resolution. Title IV: Special Functions of the Secretary of Defense in Nuclear Nonproliferation Matters - Requires the approval of the Secretary of Defense for international cooperation agreements, export licenses, and subsequent arrangements with respect to nuclear material."
