Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon request, information relating to notices of termination of certificates filed by tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations to provide title II coverage for their employees and information relating to dissolution of such organizations. Provides that the amendments made by this Act shall cease to be effective January 1, 1988, and the Social Security Act and Internal Revenue Code provisions so amended shall read on and after such date as if this Act had not been enacted. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit to Congress by January 1, 1987, recommendations as to whether the amendments should be extended beyond their termination date."
