Deletes the requirement of a reduction in the payment to an SSI beneficiary who lives in such a residence when the residence does not meet State standards. Directs the Secretary, upon finding that the standards established by a State under this Act will assure a reasonable standard of well-being for residents of such institutions, to reimburse the State for the costs of compensating or training of personnel to inspect such institutions."
