    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #223 (262-149)) National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for fiscal year 1982 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (5) ocean drilling programs; (6) Antarctic research programs; (7) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (8) cross-directorate programs; (9) program development and management; and (10) science and engineering education. Authorizes additional sums for fiscal year 1982 for special programs for the modernization of research equipment and facilities. Apportions funds among such programs if appropriations are less than the amount authorized. Limits the amount of authorizations which may be expended for consultation and for expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Permits the transfer of funds among categories if the chairmen of the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources each write the Director of the Foundation that there is no objection to the transfer or 30 days have passed after such committees were notified of the proposed transfer. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to permit the National Science Board to establish special commissions of any size to study issues relating to research and education in science and engineering (currently restricted as to size and scope of study)."
