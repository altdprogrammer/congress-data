Stipulates that such grants shall be made only to those cities, counties, and Indian tribes which have provided low and moderate income housing and equal opportunity in housing and employment for low and moderate income persons and minority group members. Sets forth application procedures and criteria for selecting grant recipients. Directs the Secretary to coordinate such grant program with other agency programs, and to review and audit grant recipients."
