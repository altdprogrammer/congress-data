Directs the Secretary of Labor to carry out the provisions of this Act and to administer the program. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with eligible applicants (local education agencies, employers, employee organizations, community based organizations, and other providers of training of demonstrated effectiveness) to fund approved programs. Directs the Secretary to consult with the Departments of Education and Commerce in carrying out such activities. Sets forth criteria for approval of program plans submitted by eligible applicants. Sets forth conditions for receipt of funds for such programs. Permits local education agencies to also apply for funds for programs designed to upgrade the skills of classroom instructors who will be providing training under this Act. Sets forth provisions for the allocation of funds (including allocating 90 percent to urban areas and ten percent to rural areas). Sets forth requirements for applicant plans. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for evaluation studies to determine the effectiveness of the program; and (2) report annually on the program. Requires preliminary reports to Congress and other interested parties on December 15, 1980, 1981, and 1982. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for fiscal years 1982 through 1985."
