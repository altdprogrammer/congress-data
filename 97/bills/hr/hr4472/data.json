Requires the Board to make investments securing the maximum possible interest yield with the portion of the Trust Funds not required to meet current withdrawals. Fixes the interest rates for public-debt obligations issued for purchase by the Trust Funds at the average market yield on all marketable interest bearing U.S. obligations forming part of the public debt, all marketable interest bearing obligations which are not U.S. obligations but which are guaranteed by the United States, and all marketable federally sponsored agency interest bearing obligations which are lawful investments for fiduciary and trust funds under Federal control. Authorizes the Managing Trustee to use the equipment and experts necessary to assure the maximum interest yield on Trust Fund investments."
