Abolishes the previous classifications of the High Sierra Primitive Area, the Emigrant Basin Primitive Area, and the Salmon - Trinity Alps Primitive Area. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to review and report to the President on the suitability for preservation as wilderness of the Monache Wilderness Study Area in the Sequoia National Forest and the North Mountain Planning Area in the Stanislaus National Forest. Requires the Secretary to maintain their presently existing wilderness character. Requires that timber volumes within the North Mountain Planning Area be included in the base used to determine potential yield for the Stanislaus National Forest. Directs the Secretary to acquire any privately owned lands within the Trinity Alps, Granite Chief, Castle Crags, and Mount Shasta Wilderness areas designated by this Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to review and report to the President on the suitability for preservation as wilderness of the Eightmile and Blue Creek Planning Areas in the Six Rivers and Klamath National Forests and the Orleans Mountain Planning Area in the Six Rivers National Forest. Requires the Secretary to conduct a special study on the suitability of the Ski Study Area in the Orleans Mountain Planning Area for an alpine ski facility. Directs the Secretary to maintain the presently existing wilderness character of such planning areas. Requires that timber volumes within such planning areas be included in the base used to determine potential yield for the national forests concerned. Subjects certain mining activities within the North Fork Smith roadless area only to Federal laws and regulations for national forest lands designated as nonwilderness. Exempts the second roadless area review and evaluation program (RARE II) final environmental statement from judicial review with respect to national forest system lands in California. Provides that, upon enactment of this Act, the injunction issued in State of California versus Bergland shall no longer be in force. States that the RARE II is, for purposes of the initial land management plans required by Federal law for national forest lands, an adequate consideration of the suitability of such lands for wilderness designation, and the wilderness option need not be reviewed prior to revision of the initial plans or to the completion date of the initial planning cycle. Provides that areas reviewed in the RARE II and not designated as wilderness by this Act or remaining in further planning need not be protected for wilderness designation pending such revision. Prohibits the conduct of any further roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in California without express Congressional authorization."
