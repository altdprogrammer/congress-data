    "text": "Amends the copyright law to permit secondary transmissions to the public by a cable system where the carriage of such signals is permissible under regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on July 1, 1980. Makes violations of such provision an infringement of copyright. Repeals the authority of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to make adjustments in royalty rates in the event of such permission. Amends the provisions concerning the limitation of exclusive rights concerning secondary transmissions, effective January 1, 1983. Permits the reception of signals by means of the direct reception of a free space radio wave. Permits secondary transmission by a cable system to the public of a primary transmission made by a licensed station if: (1) the cable system is located within the local service area of the primary transmitter; (2) the secondary transmission is of a network television program not available from any television broadcast station located within the local service area served by the cable system; or (3) the cable system serves fewer than 2500 subscribers. Eliminates compulsory licensing for such transmissions."
