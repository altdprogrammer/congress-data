Requires, in the case of cards issued to aliens who are not in the United States under conditions which make it lawful for them to engage in employment, that such card be marked to indicate that such individual may not be legally employed. Authorizes the reissuance of such card without such mark at such time as it is determined that the alien may lawfully engage in employment in the United States. Prohibits any employer from hiring any individual unless the employer has examined the card and determined that the individual may be lawfully employed. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed so as to require any individual to carry on his or her person any such card. Establishes criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly employ alien holders of cards which indicate that they may not lawfully engage in employment in the United States."
