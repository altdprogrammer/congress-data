    "text": "Radioactive Waste Research, Development, and Policy Act - Title I: Repositories for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel - Directs the Secretary of Energy to prepare a mission plan for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste which shall include: (1) information on research and development needs for repository siting and construction; (2) an evaluation of any financial, political, or institutional problems; (3) a determination of the need to proceed with unlicensed research and development repositories or intermediate scale repositories, or both; (4) a comparison of the different geologic media under consideration for depository sites; (5) site selection criteria; (6) site recommendations for site characterization activities to determine suitablity for intermediate scale or permanent repositories; (7) recommendations for the form, packaging, and transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; (8) an estimate of the total repository capacity required for the safe disposal of all such waste and fuel generated through the year 2000 if no commercial reprocessing of spent fuel occurs; (9) a cost estimate of such plan; and (10) information on possible adverse impacts from such plan and alleviation of such impacts. Requires the Secretary to submit such plan to the State Planning Council on Radioactive Waste Management and the Interagency Review Group, both established by this Act, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for comments. Directs the Secretary to submit such plan to appropriate Congressional committees by March 1, 1982. States that such plan shall take effect unless disapproved by either House of Congress within 60 days. Requires, in the event of Congressional disapproval, submission of a revised plan. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress every two years on the implementation of an approved plan. Authorizes the Secretary to designate sites for unlicensed research and development repositories if such repositories are needed to gather data on the suitability of emplacement of radioactive waste or spent fuel in various geologic media. Requires consultation with the NRC and State review boards (State entities composed of representatives of local governments affected by repositories and of the general public in a State) prior to repository construction. Directs the Secretary to assess the environmental impacts of any site designation. Directs the Secretary to determine whether or not to develop intermediate scale repositories for storage of radioactive waste and spent fuel. Sets forth design requirements for such repositories. Requires submission of the mission plan and a subsequent site characterization report to the State review board of any State in which a proposed research and development, intermediate scale, or permanent repository site is located and to the tribal governing body of any Indian tribe on whose reservation a proposed repository site is located. Directs the Secretary to designate sites after: (1) completion of required environmental impact statements; (2) completion of engineering design plans for the repositories and of waste forms and packaging technologies; and (3) submission of a preliminary license application to the NRC. Permits any State review board or Indian tribal governing body to file written objections to a site designation within 30 days after such designation is made. Establishes an Independent Review and Arbitration Board to review objections filed by a State or Indian tribe and recommend remedial action if necessary. States that Board determinations are not subject to judicial review. Directs the Secretary to apply to the NRC for a construction license for each designated site once such designations are in effect. Requires the Federal Government to take title to any radioactive waste or spent fuel when it is delivered to a repository for storage. Requires Federal cooperation with States and Indian tribes in providing information on repository siting, design, construction, and operation and resolving public health and safety, environmental, and economic concerns. Directs the Secretary to make annual payments in lieu of property taxes to the States for any Federal property within their jurisdiction used for a repository. Requires the Secretary to assess annually the economic, environmental, social, and other impacts caused by repositories to determine the need, if any, for impact aid payments to a State or Indian tribe. Establishes in the Treasury a fund to finance site characterization activities, construction and operation of repositories, and impact aid payments. Prohibits the use of such funds to carry out research and development activities under the mission plan. Requires the Secretary to calculate and collect a fee from persons or entities who hold title to radioactive waste or spent fuel in interim storage for their disposal costs. Sets forth a schedule for the promulgation of standards by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the environment from radioactive materials in repositories and criteria by the NRC to apply to repository construction license applications. Establishes an Interagency Review Group to: (1) improve interagency coordination of radioactive waste management policies; (2) assist in developing the mission plan; and (3) review such plan and submit written comments on it to Congress. Establishes a State Planning Council on Radioactive Waste Management to: (1) advise the Secretary and other Federal agencies on radioactive waste management; (2) review the mission plan; (3) provide advice on repository siting; and (4) provide advice on the roles of State and local governments, State review boards, and Indian tribal governing bodies in the development of research and development repositories and in the licensing process for intermediate scale and permanent repositories. Requires the Council to report annually to the Secretary and appropriate Congressional committees on its activities. Title II: Spent Fuel Policies - States that the primary responsibility for the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel lies with the private sector. Directs the NRC to develop licensing procedures to permit the commercial reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. Prohibits Federal subsidization of such commercial reprocessing. States that Federal policy shall be to continue research and development of commercial reprocessing and reprocessing technologies that will not result in nuclear proliferation. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at sites adjacent to nuclear powerplants. Directs the NRC to recommend to Congress ways to shorten the time required for licensing of facilities for the storage of spent nuclear fuels in pools."
