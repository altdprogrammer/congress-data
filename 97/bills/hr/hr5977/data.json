    "text": "Energy Equity Act of 1982 - Amends the Energy Security Act to require the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corporation, prior to awarding financial assistance for a synthetic fuel project pursuant to such Act, to collect a fee equal to 20 percent of such financial assistance. Provides for the deposit of such fee in the Energy Equity Account for use solely for low-income home energy assistance and weatherization and for housing assistance. Restricts the use of appropriations authorized under such Act to awards and commitments for financial assistance made on or before September 30, 1982. Provides that 50 percent of all other amounts appropriated under such Act and unobligated at the end of FY 1982 shall be deposited as miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. Requires that the remaining 50 percent of such amounts be deposited in the Energy Equity Account and used solely for low-income home energy assistance and weatherization and for housing assistance. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish in the Treasury the Energy Equity Account which shall consist of: (1) the fees collected by the Corporation pursuant to this Act; and (2) the appropriations unobligated by the Corporation at the end of FY 1982. Makes two-thirds of the receipts of the Account available for low-income home energy assistance and weatherization and one-third of such receipts available to encourage the production and sales of housing. Provides that unobligated appropriations may be used for such assistance only in the form of loans or loan guarantees. Amends the Energy Security Act to terminate the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corporation on September 30, 1984. (Currently, the Corporation shall terminate on September 30, 1997.) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations after the enactment of this Act. Amends the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 to require States applying for home energy grants to agree to consider and use a system under which low-income households receive vouchers for home energy."
