    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a television network from: (1) selling or distributing television programs to U.S. television station licensees for non-network television exhibition or otherwise engaging in the syndication of programming within the United States; (2) selling or distributing television programs of which it is not the sole producer for exhibition outside the United States; or (3) reserving any option or right to share in revenues or profits in connection with such domestic or foreign sale or distribution. Prohibits, also, a television network from acquiring any right or interest in the commercial use of any television program produced by a person other than such network, other than the license to network exhibition within the United States and on foreign stations regularly included within such network, except that if the network does not timely avail itself of such license to U.S. network exhibition then the grantor of the license may reacquire such license."
