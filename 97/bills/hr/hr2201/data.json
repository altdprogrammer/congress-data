    "text": "Consumer Product Safety Amendments of 1981 - Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission, before promulgating any consumer product safety rule, to prepare a regulatory impact analysis, including costs, benefits, and a description of alternative approaches. Requires the Commission, before promulgating any rule relating to a risk of injury with respect to which persons have adopted a voluntary safety standard, to find that: (1) compliance with the voluntary standard is not likely to eliminate or reduce the risk; or (2) substantial compliance with such standard is unlikely. Directs the Commission to assist public and private organizations in developing safety standards and test methods. Authorizes the Commission to offer training in product safety investigation and test methods. Establishes a Congressional veto procedure for consumer product safety rules. Provides that a rule not take effect if: (1) both houses of Congress adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval within 90 calendar days of its promulgation; or (2) one House adopts such a resolution within 60 days and such resolution is not disapproved by the other House within 30 days of its transmittal. Prohibits the Commission from making a contribution to the cost of developing a proposed consumer product safety standard unless the contribution is made under an agreement. Imposes a ceiling of $15,000 on such payments per fiscal year. Eliminates the current provision which prohibits a product safety standard from requiring or incorporating a sampling plan. Requires any order of the Commission requiring a person to submit reports or answer questions prescribed by the Commission to contain a complete statement of the reason such information is required to carry out a function under the Act. Requires that such order place the least practicable burden on the recipient. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Commission through fiscal year 1983."
