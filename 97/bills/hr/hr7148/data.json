Permits each State to perform such crossmatching with respect to applicants for, or recipients of, benefits under such a program administered by another State. Requires each applicant for, or recipient of, benefits to sign a statement assenting to such crossmatching and waiving the right to notice thereof. Directs each State participating in such a program to require every agency and official of such State and its political subdivisions to make relevant public records available for crossmatching. Requires Federal agencies to provide relevant records for crossmatching. Incorporates the provisions of this Act into any State or local law concerning the administration of a public benefit or subsidy program."
