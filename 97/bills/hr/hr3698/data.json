    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer an income tax deduction, not to exceed $1,500, for the educational expenses paid for the college or postsecondary vocational education of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependents. Excludes from eligibility for the deduction educational expenses for graduate study. Requires the individual for whom the tuition tax deduction is allowed by this Act to be a full-time student or a half-time student during any four months of the calendar year. Excludes from the definition of \"educational expenses\" any amount paid for meals, lodging, transportation, and similar personal expenses. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school except to the extent necessary to determine whether such school is an eligible educational institution under this Act. Provides for the immediate certification of any judicial action brought in a United States district court concerning the constitutionality of this Act to the appropriate circuit court of appeals. Authorizes direct appeal to the Supreme Court of any such decision by a circuit court. Requires the expedited consideration of such a case at both judicial levels. Requires that any amount received by the taxpayer as a tuition tax credit be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of the taxpayer for Federal, State, or local educational assistance."
