Authorizes the Consumer Product Safety Commission to determine which substances or mixtures of substances possess chronic toxicity and are capable of being ingested, inhaled, or absorbed into the human body through any customary or reasonably foreseeable handling, use, or misuse. Sets forth criteria for the determination of toxicity. Sets forth labeling requirements for such substances, including: (1) a statement which describes the nature of a side effect and an explanation of procedures to be followed to counteract such side effect; and (2) a warning where a substance has been determined to possess chronic toxicity that such substance has been shown to cause cancer in animals or in humans."
