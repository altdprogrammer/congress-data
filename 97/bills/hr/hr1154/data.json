Excludes the income of the person legally responsible for such child from any adjustments in pension rates. Grants each of two eligible veterans married to each other an individual rather than a combined pension. Excludes proceeds from specified government life insurance policies from determinations of annual income for pension purposes. Provides for annual rather than monthly reductions or discontinuances of pensions when a change of income occurs."
