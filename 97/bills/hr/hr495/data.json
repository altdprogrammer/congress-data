    "text": "Wind Energy Systems Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1981 - Establishes a research, development, and demonstration program for converting wind energy into electricity. Sets goals for such program. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into agreements with public and private entities to obtain scientific, technological, and economic information on the design, fabrication, purchase, installation, and testing of small wind energy systems (systems with a capacity of less than 100 kilowatts) and large wind energy systems (systems with a capacity of 100 or more kilowatts). Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to entities seeking to install wind energy systems upon submission of the proper application. Sets forth terms and conditions for receiving such assistance. Terminates any Federal subsidization of purchases of such equipment upon the determination that such systems have become competitive with conventional energy sources or by a specified date. Sets forth the amount of such assistance, taking into consideration any tax credits allowed under the Internal Revenue Code for renewable energy source expenditures. Allocates a portion of the funds appropriated for accelerated procurement and installation of wind energy systems by Federal agencies. Directs the Secretary to promulgate voluntary performance standards for small wind energy systems. Directs the Secretary to initiate a three-year national wind resource assessment program to: (1) validate existing assessments of known wind resources; (2) perform wind resource assessments in regions where the use of wind energy may prove feasible; (3) initiate a general site prospecting program; (4) establish standard wind data collection and siting techniques; and (5) establish, in consultation with the Administrators of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a national wind data center to make public information available on wind energy. Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit a comprehensive management plan to specified Congressional committees. Sets forth criteria for selection of programs. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies and investigations relating to wind energy systems and programs. Directs the Secretary to assure that small businesses will have adequate opportunities to participate in the programs. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981."
