    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #244 (356-52)) Job Training Partnership Act - Sets forth the purposes of this Act, including: (1) increasing the productive capacity and utilization of the Nation's labor force by improving the match between the skills of the labor force and the needs of the economy and preparing youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force; (2) enhancing the job skills of unemployed and underemployed individuals, including dislocated workers and those with obsolete skills; and (3) establishing a community-based employment and training system built on a partnership between State and local governments and the private sector. Authorizes appropriations in amounts necessary to carry out this Act (other than part B, title IV provisions relating to the Job Corps) for FY 1983 and for each succeeding fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations in a specified amount for FY 1983 and in necessary amounts for succeeding fiscal years for the Job Corps. Title I: Job Training and Employment Assistance System - Part A: Community Public-Private Partership System - Provides that a prime sponsor under this Act shall be: (1) a State; (2) any local government with at least 150,000 population; (3) any consortium of local governments which includes a local government with at least 150,000 population; (4) any consortium of local governments which has an aggregate at least 150,000 population and which includes any local government previously designated as a prime sponsor under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act; (5) any local government or consortium of local governments, without regard to population, which can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that it serves a substantial portion of a labor market area (LMA) for which no other eligible local government has submitted an approvable plan; (6) any existing concentrated employment program grantee which served a rural area under CETA; and (7) during FY 1983 through 1988, any local government or consortium previously designated as a CETA prime sponsor, subject to specified conditions. Makes any prime sponsor which is a specified type of consortium and which serves a substantial portion of an LMA eligible to receive certain bonus payments. Permits a State to qualify as a prime sponsor for any geographic area which is not within the jurisdiction of other prime sponsors. Directs the Governor of such a State to: (1) designate one or more service delivery areas (SDAs) within the area served by the State as a prime sponsor, in consultation with the local governments in each such area; and (2) establish a private industry council (PIC) for each such area. Prohibits a larger local government from qualifying as a prime sponsor with respect to the jurisdiction within its area of any smaller local government which is, or is part of, a prime sponsor that has submitted an approvable plan. Requires an applicant to submit to the Secretary a notice of intent to be a prime sponsor under this Act for a two-year period. Directs the Secretary to designate as a prime sponsor any applicant submitting such notice, unless such applicant does not qualify. Authorizes the Secretary to designate the State or other alternate prime sponsor in the State to develop a plan for any area for which no prime sponsor has been designated. Requires, if two or more previously designated prime sponsors are eligible to be so designated under this Act but are located in a single LMA within the same State, that such prime sponsors establish a joint PIC: (1) which serves an area with at least 150,000 population or comprising a substantial portion of such LMA; and (2) on which each prime sponsor is entitled to proportionate representation. Requires each prime sponsor under this Act to establish a PIC with joint responsibility for the planning of activities. Permits a prime sponsor to designate for such purpose a PIC which served the same prime sponsor area under CETA. Prohibits a prime sponsor from using funds under this Act for any activity not approved by the PIC. Requires that: (1) a majority of PIC members be representatives of business and industry in the area served by the prime sponsor; (2) such representatives be recommended by local business organizations; (3) whenever possible, at least one-half of such business and industry representatives represent small business, including minority business; and (4) the remaining representatives represent labor, education, rehabilitation, community-based organizations, the employment service, and economic development organizations and agencies and be recommended by appropriate organizations and agencies. Directs the prime sponsor to ensure that PIC membership reasonably represents the population of the area served. Provides that members be appointed for fixed terms and serve until successors are appointed.

Requires that vacancies be filled in the same manner as the original PIC member appointments. Directs each prime sponsor to: (1) make funds available, out of its allowable administrative costs, for PIC staff; and (2) ensure that each PIC is eligible for designation as a planning council for any other employment and training programs within designated enterprise zones. Provides for nationally established performance standards for programs under part B of title I, title III, and part A of title IV, as well as for programs carried out by prime sponsors under this Act. Directs the Secretary, with respect to prime sponsor programs, to: (1) establish national performance criteria based on such factors as unsubsidized employment placement and retention, wage increases, and reduction in the number of individuals receiving cash welfare payments; and (2) designate education competencies attainment, elementary, secondary, and postsecondary school completion, and referral to other training programs, such as apprenticeships or military enlistment as additional factors in the evaluation of youth programs' performance. Directs the Secretary to determine the adequacy of each prime sponsor's performance goals (and each State's proposed performance goals for programs under part B of title I and title III) on the basis of minimum performance standards based on such national performance criteria, appropriately weighting and varying the factors in such criteria to recognize local conditions and employment barriers. Authorizes the Secretary to modify application of national performance standards for prime sponsors demonstrating exceptional local economic hardship and to approve less stringent performance goals which are the best reasonably attainable goals. Directs the Secretary, where a prime sponsor is failing to attain performance goals, to: (1) provide notice and technical assistance to the prime sponsor; and (2) in the case of ongoing failure during two consecutive years, designate an alternate prime sponsor to prepare a plan for the area for the succeeding years and terminate provision of funds to the unsuccessful prime sponsor. Authorizes the Secretary, upon determination that a prime sponsor has corrected the causes of a failure, to designate that prime sponsor to prepare a plan for a two-year period after an alternate has served the area. Sets forth requirements for biennial community job training plans. Requires that such plans be developed with the participation of, and submitted with the approval of a majority of, the PIC. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate the State or other alternate prime sponsor to develop a plan, with PIC participation and majority approval, in cases where the PIC and the prime sponsor cannot concur; and (2) in the event that no alternate prime sponsor is able or willing to submit such a plan, develop an area plan directly or through an appropriate public or private nonprofit agency or organization. Directs prime sponsors, with PIC concurrence, to submit plan modifications for review, if substantial deviations from an approved biennial plan become necessary.

Requires each plan to include: (1) performance goals; (2) a statement of assurance of compliance with applicable requirements; (3) a description of methods of coordinating programs under this Act with other employment-related programs; and (4) in the case of any prime sponsor establishing a joint PIC, a description of specified arrangements with other prime sponsors. Sets forth procedures for review of prime sponsor plans by the PIC, the State legislature, and appropriate local governments and labor organizations, as well as for availability to the public, before submission for approval or disapproval by the Secretary. Requires the State employment and training council to either certify such a plan as consistent with the Governor's coordination and special services plan or to return the plan, with recommendations for modification, to the prime sponsor. Requires that such recommendations, and any modifications proposed by the Governor, accompany the plan submitted to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to notify the Governor if such recommendations or proposed modifications are not accepted. Sets forth requirements for the Secretary's review and approval of plans. Prohibits the Secretary from disapproving all or any portion of a plan solely on the basis of the type or duration of training proposed. Part B: State Responsibilities - Requires States seeking financial assistance under this Act to submit a biennial Governor's coordination and special services plan to the Secretary.
