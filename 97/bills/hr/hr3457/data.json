    "text": "Social Security Amendments of 1981 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to eliminate child's insurance benefits for full-time postsecondary school students over 17 years of age (currently such students are entitled to such benefits until attaining 22 years of age). Limits the payment of lump-sum death benefits to a widow, widower, or child who is entitled to widow's, widower's, mother's, or child's insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of a deceased individual (currently such benefits are required to be paid to cover burial expenses of the insured individual). Permits entitlement to widow's and widower's benefits for the month immediately preceding the month of application if the insured individual died in that preceding month. Provides for the continued payment of widow's or widower's benefits to a widow or widower who marries an individual entitled to old age or disability insurance benefits. Revises the method for computing maximum insurance benefits. Requires notice of the earnings reporting requirements and penalties under title II to any individual who fails to report earnings to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for any taxable year during which such individual is entitled to any monthly benefit. Revises such penalties. Sets forth provisions with respect to the computation of monthly benefits. Eliminates the minimum benefit amount used in computing the primary insurance amount. Eliminates the funding of vocational rehabilitation services for disabled beneficiaries from the Federal Old- Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Requires that an individual have at least six quarters of coverage during the 13-quarter period ending with the quarter in which such individual becomes entitled to disability insurance in order to receive disability insurance benefits. Reduces disability insurance benefits for individuals under 65 years of age who are entitled to periodic disability benefits under any Federal, State, or local law or plan (currently such benefit reduction applies to individuals under 62 years of age who are entitled to workmen's compensation benefits for total or partial disability). Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require reimbursement of the cost of providing information to assist specified parties with respect to the administration of an employee benefit plan."
