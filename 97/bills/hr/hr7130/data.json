    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 97-933 (Part II)) Title I: National Engineering and Science Manpower Programs - National Engineering and Science Manpower Act of 1982 - Directs the President to establish a special Coordinating Council on Engineering and Scientific Manpower to coordinate Federal efforts in science and engineering education and to assess the needs for trained personnel in the public and private sectors. Permits the Council to use voluntary labor. Terminates the Council after five years. Establishes within the National Science Foundation a special Engineering and Science Manpower Fund to promote and develop the quality of the U.S. technical, engineering, and scientific manpower resources. Directs the Council to consider the current and predicted supply and demand for trained manpower when administering the Fund. Requires the expenditure of moneys through matching grants. Terminates the Fund after five years. Directs the Foundation to report to Congress at least biennially concerning the Fund. Establishes within the Foundation a special program for the modernization of instructional equipment and facilities for postsecondary education in the technical, engineering, and scientific areas. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to State boards of vocational education and community colleges to assist vocational education programs to train technicians in electronic and computer technology. Directs the Secretary to consider the demand for personnel with such training, the adequacy of training opportunities, and the level and degree of industry participation when awarding such grants. Limits such grants to 25 percent of cost, with the remainder to come from industry and non-Federal public vocational education funds. Establishes within the National Science Foundation the Presidential science and engineering young investigators awards program to encourage young scientists at the university level to pursue careers in academic research. Requires that the program be administered in cooperation with the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Requires the Director of the Foundation to select recipients from among untenured faculty members in mathematics, the physical or biological sciences, or engineering at universities with established doctoral research programs. States that such award shall consist of a base research support grant of $25,000 per year for five years. Permits the Director to make an additional award for five years which requires the matching of the Federal share on a two for one basis, up to a $75,000 annual total. Establishes a Federal program for university research facilities and science and technical manpower improvement to upgrade academic research for the physical and biological sciences. Authorizes specified Federal agencies to make grants. Directs the Foundation to establish guidelines for agency participation. Requires the Director to submit such guidelines to the aforementioned committee before such budget submission. Requires the Director to report at least annually to such committees. Terminates such program after five years. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1987. Title II: National Science and Mathematics Education Improvement Programs - Science and Mathematics Improvement Act - Part A: Local Programs to Improve Science and Mathematics Education - Authorizes local education agencies in a State to establish a program to improve the quality of mathematics, science, foreign languages, and technology education at the elementary and secondary level and to provide teacher training and institutes in mathematics and science. Makes Federal funds available to these agencies upon application to the Secretary of Education and the State educational agency. Establishes a formula for distributing funds to local agencies, up to a total authorization of $100 per pupil. Requires such programs to assess student achievement and establish goals of improvement. Entitles those local agencies meeting their goals to an additional payment. Makes school districts with high numbers or concentrations of low income children eligible for an additional grant. Part B: State Efforts to Improve Science and Mathematics Education - Reserves up to five percent of appropriations for State programs and planning. Requires State educational agencies wishing to participate to develop a State plan. Permits States to use their funds for development, pilot programs, evaluation of technological hardware and software, technical assistance to local school districts, and other activities. Part C: General Provisions - Makes the Secretary of Education responsible for administering these programs. Requires State and local educational agencies to provide for the participation of private school children in these programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1987."
