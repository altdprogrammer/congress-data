  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-05-06", 
    "text": "Air Traffic System Personnel Improvements Act - Requires the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to certify promptly to specified congressional committees whenever: (1) the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) air traffic allocation system ceases to be in effect; and (2) the FAA has employed adequate civilian personnel to operate the Federal air traffic control system at full capacity. Entitles the following FAA employees to a lump sum bonus payment if such a certification is made before January 1, 1983: (1) certain employees directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the air traffic control system; (2) certain flight test pilots; and (3) certain employees at the Federal Aviation Administration Academy in Oklahoma responsible for training air traffic controllers. Prohibits such entitlement for air traffic controllers who were terminated because of their participation in the 1981 air traffic controller strike. Provides that employees eligible for such bonus payment shall not be disqualified from receiving it if they stop working due to a disability. Provides that air traffic controllers who were terminated because of their participation in the 1981 strike shall not, as a class, be considered unsuitable for reinstatement or appointment to any position in the FAA. Repeals the limit on premium pay for Federal employees. Provides for a prohibition on furloughs and reductions-in-force for FAA employees eligible for the bonus payment during the period beginning on the enactment of this Act and ending 180 days after the date of certification pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Administrator of the FAA to pay premium pay to any air traffic controller assigned to provide on-the-job training to another controller. Provides that such premium pay shall be in addition to any other premium pay to which such a controller may be entitled. Entitles an air traffic controller to enter a training program for a second career if, in addition to the requirement that the controller is being removed from his or her position for medical reasons or because the Secretary determines the controller cannot maintain the necessary technical proficiency, the controller: (1) is not a supervisor; (2) has completed at least ten years of service as a controller; (3) is ineligible for immediate retirement; (4) within a specified time, has not declined a reasonable offer of a position in the Department of Transportation for which the controller is qualified and which is not lower than two grades below the controller's current grade level; (5) within a specified time, has notified the appropriate regional review board in writing of his or her intention to apply for such training; (6) submits to such board an application and a physician's certification that the controller will be able to complete the training and engage in the new occupation; and (7) within a specified time, notifies the Secretary in writing of the controller's intent to participate in an approved training program and agreement to repay training expenses if the controller fails to complete the program. Requires the Secretary to designate Department employees to serve as regional career counselors responsible for assisting controllers in developing proposed training programs. Directs the Secretary to establish regional review boards to consider applications for training. Sets forth the requirements for approval of a proposed training program. Requires a review board to modify a proposed training program which does not meet such requirements and approve it as modified. Requires a review board to notify the Secretary and the controller in writing of its approval and any modifications. Prohibits the approval of any training program which extends beyond two years. Requires each review board to maintain a list of physicians qualified to make the certification required under this Act. Directs a review board to notify the Secretary of Labor upon receiving notification of a controller's intention to apply for training and to request such Secretary to expedite any pending determination with respect to a disability compensation award. Permits the modification of an approved training program upon the controller's request with the consent of the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to pay, or reimburse a controller for, the expenses of an approved training program. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the controller's liability for training expenses in any case where a controller fails to complete an approved training program. Requires the Administrator to develop and implement a personnel management improvement program within the FAA which: (1) improves communication between employees and management; (2) allows for employee participation in, and takes into account personnel factors associated with, major technological changes; (3) provides cost-efficient responses to variations in air traffic levels; (4) provides for periodic employee surveys with respect to organizational conditions, supervision, employee interaction, and job satisfaction; (5) modifies criteria for selection of supervisors; and (6) modifies criteria used for performance appraisals. Requires the Administrator to report periodically on such program to the Advisory Committee on Federal Aviation Personnel Management established under this Act and annually to Congress, the Secretary, and the National Transportation Safety Board. Directs the Secretary to establish an Advisory Committee on Federal Aviation Personnel Management to review the Administrator's reports and give advice on the program. Terminates the Committee ten years after the date of its establishment. Makes the 50-percent minimum annuity requirement for retiring Federal employees inapplicable in the case of an individual who: (1) has received a refund of retirement deductions covering any period in which the individual was an air traffic controller; and (2) has not made redeposits for credit for the amounts refunded."
