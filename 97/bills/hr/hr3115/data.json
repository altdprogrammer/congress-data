Permits transfers of funds of up to ten percent between categories of activities authorized under this Act, as well as transfers of more than ten percent if the Congress is notified and the appropriate committees do not object. Requires that at least 15 percent of funds appropriated for each activity be obligated and expended for long-term environmental research and development programs. Directs the Administrator to: (1) conduct a study of the use of peer review in research planning by means of a pilot project utilizing peer review projects; and (2) report the results of such study, with recommendations, to the Congress and the Science Advisory Board within one year of the enactment of this Act. Directs the principal research official of the Agency to commission annually several critical reviews of scientific, technical or engineering literature in various fields, using general criteria established and published by the Science Advisory Board.

Requires that reports of such research work state whether or not the work was performed and reported in accordance with such procedures. Directs the Administrator to conduct a study on: (1) coordination of Federal environmental research, development, and demonstration; (2) application of such to environmental problems; and (3) improvement of related information dissemination and data system integration. Directs the Science Advisory Board to develop and manage such study in consultation with Agency program offices and an interagency advisory committee and with oversight and review by the National Academy of Sciences. Requires that such study conclude with a report, with recommendations, to be submitted to the President and the Congress 18 months after the enactment of this Act. Prohibits the use of any funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act to further or facilitate an intentional release of radioactive contaminated water from the Three Mile Island Reactor Number Two into the Susquehanna River or its watershed."
