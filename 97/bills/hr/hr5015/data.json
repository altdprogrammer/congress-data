    "text": "Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to assist Pakistan against aggression from a Communist or Communist dominated state. Requires security assistance to be made available to help Pakistan deal with the threat posed by the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for providing aid to Pakistan through the Economic Support Fund. Subjects such aid to the limitations on nuclear transfers and detonations. Reaffirms that a nuclear detonation by a non-nuclear-weapon state would gravely damage U.S. relations with such state. Declares that U.S. aid to that state might end if such a detonation took place. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the provision of certain economic and military aid to any country which: (1) delivers to, or receives from, another foreign country nuclear enrichment equipment, materials, or technology; or (2) delivers to, or receives from, another foreign country nuclear reprocessing equipment, materials, or technology other than certain technological alternatives to pure plutonium reprocessing. Requires suspension of certain economic and military aid to any country which: (1) transfers a nuclear explosive device to a non-nuclear- weapon state; or (2) if the country is a non-nuclear-weapon state, takes steps to build a nuclear explosive device or detonates such a device. Authorizes furnishing the military or economic aid that would otherwise be prohibited or suspended if the President makes a specified certification to Congress. Requires such a certification to take effect the day it is received by Congress. Empowers Congress to make such certification ineffective by adopting a concurrent resolution disapproving the furnishing of aid pursuant to such certification."
