    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Extends the scope of such offense to include displaying or offering to use a firearm, whether or not capable of being discharged. Deletes the current requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Applies the mandatory penalties to commission of a felony involving the use or threat of violence. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years), ten to 25 years for a second offense (currently, two to 25 years for a second or subsequent offense), and 25 years to life for a third offense. Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Prohibits the granting of parole to any offender."
