    "date": "1981-02-03", 
    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Extends the scope of such offense to include: (1) using or carrying a firearm during commission of any felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction; or (2) using or carrying illegally any firearm in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce during commission of any crime punishable by more than one year's imprisonment. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to ten years to life imprisonment for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose the additional sentence concurrently with the sentence imposed for the felony. Reduces from 21 to 18 the age requirement for purchasing a firearm other than a shotgun or rifle from a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer, where the transferee does not appear in person at the licensee's business premises. Eliminates recordkeeping requirements imposed on licensed importers, manufacturers, and dealers with respect to the sale of ammunition."
