Amends part B (Professional Standards Review) of title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize the Administration to waive any or all of the reviews, certification, or similar activities required under title XVIII with respect to health care services if it finds such activities are not needed based on substantial evidence of the effective performance of review and control activities by Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO's).
