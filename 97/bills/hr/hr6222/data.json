    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Reserve Requirements Reform Act of 1982 - Amends the Federal Reserve Act to exempt a certain amount of the deposits and accounts of depository institutions from reserve requirements set forth by such Act. Limits such exemptions to $2,000,000 of transaction accounts, nonpersonal time deposits, and balances and assets of each depository institution. Requires the Board to minimize the reporting necessary to determine whether depository institutions have total reservable liabilities of less than $2,000,000. Declares that depository institutions which have reserve requirements equal to zero percent shall be subject to less overall reporting requirements. Requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, not later than December 31 of each year, to issue a regulation increasing for the next succeeding calendar year the dollar amount of such exemption by an amount obtained by multiplying such dollar amount by 80 percent of the percentage increase in the total deposits of all depository institutions. Sets forth the procedure for determining such increase in the total deposits. Mandates no adjustment following a 12-month period in which there has been a decrease in total deposits of all depository institutions."
