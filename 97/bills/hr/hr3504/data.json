Requires States desiring to receive funds for such programs to submit program plans to the Secretary of Labor. Limits the Federal contribution to such programs to 70 percent of the cost of acquisition of transit fare passes. Sets forth formulas for the allocation to each State of funds for such programs. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
