    "text": "Comprehensive Coal Job Compensation, Protection, and Promotion Act of 1982 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to set forth special provisions for iron and steel workers and certain coal miners. Requires that the provisions of such Act dealing with trade readjustment allowances, as in effect before enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, shall apply to iron or steel workers and miners certified as eligible for such allowances. Requires the Secretary of Labor to approve job training for such workers and miners if specified conditions are met. Requires the maximum job search and relocation allowances for such workers and miners to be $800 rather than $600. Establishes in the Treasury a Steel and Coal Workers Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund to carry out such special provisions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 and thereafter to the Trust Fund of: (1) amounts in the Treasury attributable to the collection of customs duties, countervailing duties, and antidumping duties on iron or steel imports; and (2) such other sums as necessary. Requires the Secretary to establish a Coal Industry Full Employment Council to advise the Secretary on the reasons for coal labor unemployment and measures to reduce such unemployment. Requires the Council to submit an annual report to the President. Urges the President to negotiate agreements with countries that are major exporters of iron and steel to the United States under which the countries will import U.S. coal in quantities equivalent to those used in the production of such iron and steel. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to take such action as necessary to promote the sale to foreigners of coal produced in regions with high coal labor unemployment."
