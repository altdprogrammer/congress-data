    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1981-06-02", 
    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for the necessary expenses of the U.S. International Trade Commission for fiscal year 1982. Prohibits use of any such appropriations to pay for any study requested by an Executive agency unless such agency reimburses the Commission. Amends the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 to authorize appropriations to the Department of the Treasury for the salaries and expenses of the U.S. Customs Service for fiscal year 1982. Prohibits use of any such appropriations to: (1) pay any Customs Service employee more than $25,000 in overtime pay; and (2) implement any procedure relating to the collection of estimated duties that shortens a specified deferment procedure. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 and for each following fiscal year which reflect Customs Service pay rate changes made in accordance with the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for fiscal year 1982. Limits the amount of such appropriations which may be used for entertainment and representation expenses. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 and each following fiscal year which reflect Office pay rate changes made in accordance with the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970. Title II: Functions and Powers of the Office of the United States Trade Representative - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the U.S. Trade Representative to: (1) delegate and authorize redelegations of the Representative's functions, powers, and duties to certain officers and employees of the Office; (2) promulgate such rules and regulation as necessary to carry out the powers and duties as well as the functions vested in the Representative; (3) pay expenses for official travel without regard to specified Federal laws; (4) utilize gifts to aid or facilitate the work of the Office; and (5) acquire up to two cars for use abroad. Repeals the provisions of such Act which abolished the Office of Special Representative for Trade Negotiations and transferred personnel from such Office to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Title III: Miscellaneous Custom Provisions - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that: (1) the U.S. Customs Service is administered by the close of fiscal year 1983 through not more than six regional offices and 35 district offices; and (2) by the close of fiscal year 1982 the aircraft fleet of the Service consists of not more than 45 aircraft. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to increase the value limitation on articles which: (1) possess an administrative exemption from duty; (2) are subject to summary forfeiture, judicial forfeiture, or summary sale by Customs officials; (3) are imported under a personal exemption; and (4) are certain noncommercial imports. Amends the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to increase the maximum amount which the owner of a private aircraft or vessel can be required to pay for customs services performed by certain Federal officials upon domestic arrival or departure of such aircraft or vessel. Urges the President to negotiate an agreement with Canada under which joint U.S.-Canadian customs facilities can be maintained at border crossings where the volume of traffic does not warrant separate facilities. Requires the U.S. Customs Service, Department of Agriculture, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to conduct six-month tests, in at least two major international airports, of new Federal inspection systems to facilitate passenger entry into the United States. Requires a report to be submitted to Congress containing the results of and evaluating such tests including the data on differences between traditional processing and the new systems of processing and an assessment of potential manpower savings of the new systems."
