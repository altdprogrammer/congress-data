    "text": "Tuition Tax Relief Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer an income tax credit for 50 percent of the tuition paid for the elementary, secondary, college, or post-secondary vocational education of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependents. Sets forth maximum dollar amounts allowable as a credit. Requires the individual for whom the tuition tax credit is allowed by this Act to be a full-time student or a part-time student during any four months of the calendar year. Excludes graduate students from eligibility for such credit. Excludes from the definition of \"tuition\" any amounts paid for books, supplies, equipment for coursework, meals, lodging, transportation, similar personal expenses, and education below the first-grade level. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school except to the extent necessary to determine whether such school is an eligible educational institution within the meaning of this Act."
