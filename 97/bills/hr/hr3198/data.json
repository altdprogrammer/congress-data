Eliminates the triggering mechanism and preclearance requirements for all jurisdictions except those covered by the language minority provisions. Limits to four years the period for which a Federal court may require preclearance for any jurisdiction. Makes such remedy available in any case brought by the Attorney General for relief against a widespread pattern or practice of voting denial. Authorizes the Attorney General to intervene in any civil action brought by a person to protect rights under this title upon certification that the case is of general public importance."
