    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Makes the additional penalties inapplicable to a felony consisting solely of the possession, transportation, or sale of a firearm. Increases the additional penalty to two years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and five years for a second offense (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second or subsequent offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Prohibits the granting of parole to any offender. Prohibits the Government attorney from entering into any plea agreement."
