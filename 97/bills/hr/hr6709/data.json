Provides that a defendant is \"guilty but insane\" if his actions constitute all necessary elements of the offense charged other than the requisite state of mind. Provides that if the defendant is found \"guilty but insane\" the court may commit the defendant to serve all or a portion of a sentence in a suitable facility for treatment of his mental condition. Requires the defendant to serve the remaining portion of his sentence upon release from the mental facility."
