Requires AT&T to submit a divestiture plan to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) if AT&T seeks divestiture after the two year period. Requires the FCC to issue an order approving or disapproving the plan within 60 days after it is submitted. Requires any order approving such a plan to be submitted to Congress. Permits such an order to become effective only if Congress adopts a concurrent resolution approving the order within 30 days of its submission."
