Directs each agency, not more than 90 or less than 30 days before a proposed reduction in force takes effect, to notify each employee competing for job retention of: (1) the specific action to be taken with respect to that employee; (2) the purpose of the reduction in force; (3) the area of the agency affected and other information used to determine the employee's standing in the competition for retention; (4) the availability of the regulations and records pertaining to the employee; (5) the reasons for any exceptions to the general release order; (6) the employee's right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board; (7) the availability and terms and conditions of the voluntary reduced worktime program; and (8) the extent of the reduction in force without such program. Directs each agency, upon providing such notice, to survey competing employees to determine: (1) the interest in participating in a voluntary reduced worktime program; and (2) the amount of time by which employees are willing to have their worktime reduced. Requires that competing employees be promptly informed of the survey results and afforded an opportunity to apply for participation in such a program. Provides for a reduction in the pay of a participating employee. Requires the length of service of a participating employee to be determined as if no reduction in worktime had occurred. Prohibits an agency from involuntarily separating an employee in a reduction in force unless the savings in personnel costs or other purposes of the reduction in force cannot be achieved through such a program. Prohibits an agency from appointing an individual to a position in an area where any employee is employed on a reduced worktime basis unless: (1) each such employee has been given an opportunity to return to such employee's former work schedule in the same or a higher position; (2) no such employee will accept appointment to such position; or (3) the position cannot be modified to permit the appointment of such an employee. Requires that employees on reduced work schedules be counted as fractions in administering personnel ceilings. Exempts specified employees from coverage under an agency's voluntary reduced worktime program. Requires the head of each executive agency to notify the Comptroller General of: (1) the extent and basis of any proposed reduction in force; and (2) the effectiveness of the agency's voluntary reduced worktime program. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress: (1) upon determining that any reduction in force is unnecessary or premature; and (2) at least annually on the effectivenss of such programs. Prohibits a Federal employee who has authority over personnel actions from coercing any employee into participating in such a program. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to promulgate regulations to implement this Act within 30 days after enactment."
