    "text": "Victims of Crime Act of 1981 - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified State programs for the compensation of victims of crimes. Provides that such grants shall total 33 percent of program costs with respect to qualifying crimes. Defines such crimes to include: (1) State crimes designated by the State to be appropriate for compensation; and (2) crimes which would constitute designated crimes but are subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Specifies criteria for a State plan to qualify for grants, including that the program: (1) offer compensation to surviving dependents of persons whose deaths result from qualifying crimes; (2) grant claimants the right to a hearing; (3) condition compensation on cooperation with law enforcement officials; (4) not require claimants to seek welfare benefits; (5) deny recovery where the claimant willingly contributed to the injury; and (6) not require apprehension or conviction of the offender. Requires that the State have in effect laws or rules which: (1) subrogate the State to any claim the claimant has against the perpetrator of the crime; (2) assess any person convicted of a qualifying crime a court cost of at least $250 or ten percent of the fine, payable to the compensation fund; and (3) require proceeds from any interview or article relating to the crime to be paid into an escrow fund for the benefit of victims. Enumerates expenses which shall be excluded from a State's program costs when determining the amount of the authorized grant, including any amount of an award exceeding $15,000 per victim, adjusted annually for inflation. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the Congressional judiciary committees on each qualifying State program. Makes a perpetrator of a qualifying crime ineligible to receive any cash payment under a Federal entitlement program during his or her term of imprisonment. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 to carry out this Act."
