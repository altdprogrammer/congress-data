Authorizes the Secretary to apportion funds for transportation projects that will alleviate the environmental, social, and economic impact of substantial or increased train traffic to meet such energy requirements. Permits such projects to include systems management methods, grade crossing separation, and rail and highway relocation. Limits the Federal share of the cost of any such project to 80 percent. Directs the Secretary to establish a formula for the apportionment of funds under this Act. Prohibits any State from receiving less than one-half of one percent or more than 12 percent of the total apportionment made under this Act. Authorizes appropriations for such projects for fiscal years 1982 through 1985."
