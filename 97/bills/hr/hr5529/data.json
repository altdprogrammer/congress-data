Requires the number of persons in such districts to be as equal as practicable, according to the most recent decennial census. Requires each district to be: (1) drawn with due regard to significant natural geographic barriers; (2) defined by boundaries which coincide with boundaries of local political subdivisions; and (3) compact in form. Defines the numerical equality of persons in such districts to be either absolute numerical equality or, under certain circumstances, reasonable numerical equality. Prohibits a State from drawing boundaries of districts for: (1) the purpose of favoring any political party or individual; or (2) the purpose of, or with the effect of, denying effective voting representation to any language or racial minority group. Prohibits construing this Act to supersede the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Authorizes any eligible voter to sue in U.S. district court for enforcement of this Act in such voter's State. Sets forth provisions for judicial review of actions brought to enforce this Act."
