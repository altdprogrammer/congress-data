Sets forth interest and loan repayment requirements. Requires the Board of Trustees of the trust funds to report to Congress on any funds transferred pursuant to this Act. Terminates a trust fund's borrowing authority with respect to the general fund of the Treasury if, within one year after a loan is made to such fund from one of the other funds, such fund's cash reserves have not returned to at least 13 percent of such fund's anticipated expenditures for the then current fiscal year. Requires the Board of Trustees to report to Congress at the end of the one year on the increase in appropriations to such fund which would be necessary to raise the fund's cash reserves to the 13 percent level."
