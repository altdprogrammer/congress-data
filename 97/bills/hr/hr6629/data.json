    "text": "Title I: Domestic Content Requirements for Covered Articles - Authorizes any entity which represents a U.S. industry producing a product which is like, or directly competitive with, a covered article to petition the International Trade Commission (ITC) for a determination on whether a trade emergency exists regarding the covered article. Defines a \"covered article\" to mean any manufactured article. Defines a \"trade emergency\" to mean that a covered article is being imported in such increased quantities that the imports are a substantial cause of serious injury or threaten serious injury to the domestic industry. Directs the ITC to take into account all relevant economic factors in making such determination, including specific factors with respect to serious injury, the threat of serious injury, and substantial cause. Requires the ITC to report its determination within 90 days after the petition is filed. Directs the ITC to recommend import relief and the domestic content requirement it considers appropriate if it determines that a trade emergency exists. Directs the President to declare that a trade emergency exists within 30 days of receiving an ITC report containing such determination. Directs the President to prohibit for one year the importation of an article covered in such declaration unless it has: (1) the domestic content percentage recommended by the ITC; or (2) a domestic content percentage set by the President if the President determines that the ITC's recommendation is not appropriate. Directs the President to submit a domestic content percentage to the Congress for review if the President imposes a percentage different from the one recommended by the ITC. Makes such percentage effective unless both Houses of Congress adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving it within 90 days after it is submitted to Congress. Provides for expedited consideration of such a concurrent resolution. Authorizes the President to extend the import relief granted for a covered article for another year. Requires the ITC to monitor the effect of such relief during the first six months of the 12 months for which it is granted. Authorizes the President to: (1) increase the domestic content requirement by not more than an additional 25 percent; or (2) if the President considers such relief to have been effective to reduce or terminate the requirement. Authorizes the President to limit imports of a covered article if the ITC determines that the applicable domestic content requirement has not been met. Prohibits an ITC investigation of a possible trade emergency involving a covered article if less than one year has elapsed since the last such investigation. Title II: Motor Vehicle Warranties - Declares that it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act for a motor vehicle manufacturer or a manufacturer's representative to: (1) void or attempt to void a warranty on a new motor vehicle solely because nonwarranty work or service is performed on the vehicle by a person who is not a representative of the manufacturer or solely because the work is done with some other manufacturer's parts; (2) include in any information given to the ultimate purchaser any statement that implies that work or service not covered by the warranty must be done by a manufacturer's representative; and (3) fail to include a statement in any warranty or other information issued to the ultimate purchaser that the warranty coverage shall not be affected solely because some nonwarranty work or service is done by a person who is not a manufacturer's representative or solely because such work or service is done using some other manufacturer's parts that meet the specifications of the vehicle manufacturer."
