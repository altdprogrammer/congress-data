    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-05-06", 
    "text": "Single-Family Housing Production Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to enter into contracts to make periodic assistance payments to mortgagees and other lenders on behalf of homeowners (including owners of manufactured homes and condominium units) with incomes of up to 130 percent of the median area income. Terminates such authority of the Secretary on September 30, 1982. Directs the Secretary to give priority to assisting persons who have not owned a home within the last three years. Sets ceilings for: (1) the total amount of payments made under such contracts each year; and (2) the total amount obligated during the life of such contracts. Permits payments to be made only to a homeowner who satisfies requirements for creditworthiness and who is: (1) a mortgagor under a mortgage which is eligible for assistance under this Act; or (2) the original owner of a new, federally-insured, manufactured home. Provides for payments on behalf of such a homeowner only for as long as the homeowner occupies the property, unless the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Limits the amount of such assistance payments to the amount required to lower the mortgagor's monthly mortgage payments to the payments that would be required if the mortgage were to bear interest at the greater rate of: (1) nine and one-half percent (ten percent if the mortgagor's income exceeds 115 percent of median area income); or (2) a rate six percentage points less than specified in the mortgage (four percentage points if the mortgagor's income exceeds 115 percent of median area income). Requires that a mortgagor pay at least 25 percent of his or her income toward the monthly mortgage payments. Limits the duration of assistance payments to seven years (five years if the mortgagor's income exceeds 115 percent of median area income). Establishes a fund into which recaptured or unused assistance shall be deposited and from which the Secretary may provide continued assistance to a mortgagor who is unable to assume full mortgage payments after regular assistance payments end. Limits the number of manufactured homes assisted under this Act to 20 percent of the total number of assisted units. Includes among conditions a mortgage must meet for the mortgagor to qualify for assistance under this Act the requirements that a mortgage: (1) be secured by a newly constructed single-family dwelling that meets energy conservation standards prescribed by the Secretary; (2) permit prepayment without penalty; (3) have a fixed rate of interest; and (4) be executed by a mortgagor who paid at least three percent of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of acquisition. Directs the Secretary to develop a system for allocating assistance under this Act among the various regions of the country on the basis of such factors as population, relative decline in building permits, and the need for increased housing production. Directs the Secretary to recapture the lesser of the amount of assistance provided under this Act or an amount equal to 50 percent of the net appreciation of the property whenever the mortgagor sells the property or rents it for a period exceeding one year. Requires the Secretary to adopt procedures for annual recertification of a homeowner's income for the purpose of adjusting assistance payments."
