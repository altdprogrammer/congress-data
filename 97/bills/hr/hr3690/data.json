    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize specified authorizations for fiscal years 1982-1984 for: (1) research and demonstration activities; (2) statistical and epidemiological activities; and (3) the National Center for Health Care Technology. Authorizes (currently the Secretary is required) the Secretary to support certain research, evaluation, and demonstration programs, including (as of fiscal year 1982) the role of market forces in the health care system. Eliminates new projects involving the use of computers in health services and information systems but continues funding for existing projects through fiscal year 1982. Revises specified pollution and environmental reporting requirements to require: (1) such reports every three (currently every two) years; and (2) their submission to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce (currently to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce). Reduces from three to two the number of required national special emphasis centers and eliminates the special designation of Health Care Management Center. Expands the scope of authorized international cooperative projects. Requires specified grants for health technology, operations, and research and demonstrations with direct costs in excess of $50,000 (currently $35,000) to be reviewed for scientific merit before being made. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for: (1) medical libraries; and (2) National Research Service Awards. Requires reciprocal service by recipients of National Research Service Awards of at least 12 months (currently at least three months) duration."
