Requires the Secretary to insure such a loan or mortgage upon determining that: (1) the principal obligation of the mortgage or loan does not exceed a specified percentage of the appraised value of the attached property; and (2) the monthly payments and principal obligation of the loan or mortgage will not be increased at a rate greater than the percentage change in the selected index. Directs the Secretary to give priority to such mortgages executed by mortgagors who have not owned a home in the preceding three years. Directs the Secretary to conduct and report to Congress on a demonstration program to insure such loans and mortgages."
