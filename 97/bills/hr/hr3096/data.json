    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Applies the mandatory penalties to felonies involving violence or the threat of violence. Stipulates that the additional penalty shall not apply if the underlying felony consists solely of the possession, transportation, or sale of a firearm. Deletes the current requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and to ten to 25 years' imprisonment for a second or subsequent offense (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or grant probation. Requires the additional sentence or grant probation. Requires the additional sentence to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for the underlying offense. Prohibits the granting of parole to an offender."
