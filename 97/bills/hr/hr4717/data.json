    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-929) Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1982 - Title I: Tax Provisions - Amends the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 to delay until December 31, 1982, the effective date of the requirement that in cases of corporate liquidations a corporation inventorying goods under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting treat the LIFO recapture amount with respect to distributed inventory assets as ordinary income. Exempts the first $1,000,000 from such recapture requirements provided the liquidation plan is completed before January 1, 1984. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a ten year carryback and a five year carryover of that portion of the net operating loss of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) which exceeds the FMNA mortgage disposition loss (excess of losses over gains from the sale of mortgages and other debt instruments to the extent of the net operating loss for the taxable year in which the excess occurs). Permits the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale or exchange of a radio or television broadcasting station required to effectuate policies of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in a newspaper without the loss of preferential tax treatment (i.e. nonrecognition of the gain from such sale or exchange as an involuntary conversion). Qualifies shale oil equipment, including hydrogenation or similar equipment, but excluding refining equipment, for the investment tax credit. Revises the formula for computing annuity payments for surviving spouses of Tax Court judges. Increases annuities payable to surviving spouses and dependents of Tax Court judges in accordance with salary increases. Provides retroactive adjustments to annuities paid after December 31, 1963. Allows special trial judges to hear cases involving certain excise taxes, if the deficiency involved is not more than $5,000. Allows judges of the Tax Court to orally state and to record in the transcript of the proceeding, their findings of fact or opinion on the issues presented. Designates judges who are retired as \"senior judges.\" Eliminates the requirement that an employer furnish to an individual whose employment has terminated before the close of the calendar year a wage and withholding statement upon the last payment of remuneration. Requires an employer to furnish a statement within 30 days upon receipt of a written request by such employee. Permits the withholding, pursuant to a voluntary agreement, of State income taxes from the wages of a seaman employed in the coastwise trade between ports in the same State.
