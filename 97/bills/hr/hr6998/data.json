Establishes the Indian Point Nuclear Power Safety Review Panel to evaluate the NRC's investigation of, and to independently review issues relating to, the safety of, and emergency evacuation plans for, units 2 and 3 of the Indian Point Nuclear Station. Requires the Panel to report its findings to Congress and to the NRC. Requires the NRC to consider fully the Panel's report. Authorizes the NRC to remove the operating license suspensions for units 2 and 3 of the Indian Point Nuclear Station: (1) 90 days after the NRC notifies specified congressional committees; or (2) after such notification, but before 90 days expire, if such committees notify the NRC that they do not object to the proposed removal. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates the panel at the time it transmits its report."
