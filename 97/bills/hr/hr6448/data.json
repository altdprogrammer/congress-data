    "text": "Victims of Crime Compensation Act of 1982 - Title I: State Crime Victim Compensation Assistance Powers of the Attorney General - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to qualified state programs for the compensation of victims of crimes. Provides that such grants shall total: (1) 50 percent of allowable compensation paid to victims of State crimes designated by the State to be appropriate for compensation; and (2) 100 percent of allowable compensation to victims of crimes which would constitute designated crimes but are subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Establishes a nine-member Advisory Committee on Victims of Crime to advise the Attorney General with respect to the administration of this Act and the compensation of victims of crime. Specifies criteria for a State plan to qualify for grants, including that the program: (1) offer compensation to surviving dependents of persons whose deaths result from qualifying crimes; (2) grant claimants the right to a hearing; (3) condition compensation on cooperation with law enforcement officials; (4) not require claimants to seek welfare benefits; (5) deny or reduce recovery where the claimant contributed to the injury; and (6) not require apprehension or conviction of the offender. Requires that the State: (1) inform victims of the compensation program; (2) have a law or rule subrogating the State to any claim the claimant has against the perpetrator of the crime; (3) have a law or rule authorizing payment of restitution to the victim by the perpetrator; and (4) have a law or rule requiring proceeds from any interview or article relating to the crime to be paid into an escrow fund for the benefit of victims. Enumerates expenses which shall be excluded from a State's program costs when determining the amount of the authorized grant, including any amount of an award exceeding $50,000 per victim and lost earnings compensation exceeding $200 per week. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the Congressional judiciary committees on each qualifying State program. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983 through 1985 to carry out this Act. Title II: Crime Victims Compensation Trust Fund - Establishes a \"Crime Victims Compensation Trust Fund in the Treasury.\" Funds the trust with amounts received from the excise tax on pistols and revolvers."
