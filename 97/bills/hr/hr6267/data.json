Rept. 97-641) Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 - Title I: Deposit Insurance Flexibility - Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act - Part A - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Amendments - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to make loans to, make deposits in, purchase the assets or securities of, assume the liabilities of, or make contributions to, any insured bank if such action is taken: (1) to prevent the bank's closing; (2) to restore a closed insured bank; or (3) to lessen the risk to the Corporation posed by an insured bank under the threat of instability due to severe financial conditions. Authorizes the FDIC, in order to facilitate a merger or consolidation of an insured bank or the sale of assets of such insured bank and the assumption of its liabilities, or the acquisition of its stock, to: (1) purchase any such assets or assume such liabilities; (2) make loans or contributions to, or deposits in, or purchase the securities of, such institution; (3) guarantee it or the company which controls or will acquire control of it against loss by reason of merging or consolidating; or (4) any combination of the above. Prohibits the FDIC from using such authority to purchase the voting or common stock of an insured bank. Requires the Corporation, in its annual report to Congress, to report the total amount it has saved by exercising the authority provided in this Act. Amends the Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 to permit the Home Loan Bank Board to authorize the conversion of a State-chartered savings bank insured by the FDIC into a Federal savings bank. Requires continued FDIC insurance coverage for a converted bank. Permits such a conversion only where: (1) the board of trustees of the bank has specified in writing that the bank is in danger of closing or is closed, or that severe financial conditions exist that threaten the bank's stability and a conversion is likely to improve its financial conditions; and (2) the board of trustees has requested in writing that the FDIC use such authority. Amends the National Housing Act to grant the Federal Home Loan Bank Board the same supervisory powers with regard to a FDIC insured federal savings bank that it has with other Federal associations. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to allow a closed insured bank with assets of a specified amount, or insured banks with specified assets which are in danger of closing, to be acquired by out of State banks or holding companies. Permits the FDIC, in the case of a closed bank, to sell the assets of such bank and arrange for the assumption of its liabilities by an insured depository institution located in the same State. Permits the FDIC, in the case of an insured bank with a certain amount of assets which is in danger of closing, to arrange an acquisition by an insured depository institution located in the State where the insured bank is chartered. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to permit a waiver of notice and hearing requirements to allow the Federal Reserve to approve emergency acquisitions of thrift institutions by commercial banks. Part B - Federal Home Loan Bank Board Amendments - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to allow the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to authorize a mutual institution to become, or merge into, a newly-chartered, Federal stock savings bank. Amends the National Housing Act to permit the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to provide assistance to insured institutions when severe financial conditions exist which threaten the stability of a significant number of insured institutions. Includes deposits in the institution or the purchase of securities as a type of assistance. Prohibits FSLIC purchase of the voting or common stock of an insured bank. Permits the Corporation to authorize an insured institution eligible for assistance to merge with any other insured institution or an FDIC insured bank or to be acquired by any holding company.

Amends the National Housing Act to permit the FSLIC to borrow from the Federal Home Loan banks. Requires the rate on such a loan to be at least the bank's marginal cost of funds, with adequate security. Permits the FSLIC, if extraordinary financial conditions exist, to terminate distribution of shares of the secondary reserve and utilize said reserve on the same basis as the primary reserve. Part C - Credit Unions - Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to permit the National Credit Union Administration Board to authorize: (1) a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union which is insolvent, or is in danger of insolvency, with any other insured credit union; or (2) a purchase and assumption by an insured credit union of all or any part of the assets and liabilities of any other insured credit union which is in such danger. Permits the Board, ex parte without notice, to appoint itself as conservator and immediately take possession and control of the business and assets of any insured credit union where: (1) such action is necessary to conserve the assets of such a credit union; (2) the credit union consents to such an action; and (3) in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the State credit union supervisor is consulted at least 24 hours before the use of this authority by the Board. Part D - Sunset Provisions - Terminates the emergency provisions contained in Title I of this Act three years after the date of enactment. Title II: Net Worth Certificates - Net Worth Certificate Act - Amends the National Housing Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the FSLIC and the FDIC to increase or maintain the capital of a qualified institution by making periodic purchases of capital instruments (\"net worth certificates\"). Declares that each Insurance Corporation, with respect to the certificates held by it, shall have a priority over any claim arising out of an equity interest in an insured bank in the event of a liquidation or reorganization and over any right of equity holders to participate in future earnings. Requires such a bank to have: (1) a prospective net worth of at most three percent of its assets; (2) losses for two consecutive quarters; (3) a net worth of not less than one-half of one percent of assets after any purchase of its net worth certificates by the Corporation; and (4) investments in residential mortgages or mortgage-backed securities equal to at least 20 percent of its loans. Sets forth the initial net worth certificates that the FSLIC and the FDIC may purchase. Allows the FSLIC and the FDIC to establish criteria which, with respect to ranges of net worth, calculation of losses, and percentage of losses to be met by purchases of net worth certificates, differ from such criteria set forth by this Act. Prohibits both the FSLIC and the FDIC from using their authority to purchase the voting or common stock of a qualified institution. Prohibits any such assistance from being provided to a qualified institution if the FSLIC or the FDIC determines that providing such assistance would be costlier than liquidating such institution. Terminates the provisions of this title three years after the enactment of this Act. Title III: Thrift Institutions Restructuring - Thrift Institutions Restructuring Act of 1982 - Part A - Form of Charter; Demand Accounts - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to authorize the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to charter Federal stock banks as well as savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks for investment and credit purposes in addition to the provision of home financing.

Allows any aggrieved person to obtain review of a final action of the Board or the FSLIC which approves or disapproves a plan of conversion from the mutual to the stock form.
