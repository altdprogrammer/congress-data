Eliminates HMO grant or contract authority (continues current loan authority). Makes HMO application requirements applicable to the National Health Maintenance Organization Intern Program. Extends loans and loan guarantees for initial operating costs through fiscal year 1986. Permits interest rates to be adjusted for HMO loans. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1984. Authorizes specified appropriations for training (including the National Health Maintenance Organization Intern Program) and technical assistance for fiscal years 1982-1984. Eliminates certain mental health and alcohol and drug abuse services from the definition of \"basic health services\" and includes them in the definition of \"supplemental health services\" for HMO-related purposes. Repeals specified policymaking body membership requirements. Permits nonmetropolitan HMOs to provide certain basic health services outside their service areas if such services are not otherwise available. Removes certain restrictions on contracting with individual physicians. Revises HMO dual choice provisions."
