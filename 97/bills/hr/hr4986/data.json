Eliminates AFDC eligibility for non-citizens. Requires that a child has been deprived of parental support for at least 90 days before qualifying for AFDC. Excludes from AFDC any amount paid to meet the needs of a relative or an individual living with a dependent child if: (1) the relative is not living with a spouse but there is another individual in the home who has a sexual relationship with the relative; or (2) the relative or individual cannot communicate in English, except the English requirement may be waived if the relative or individual is enrolled in an approved school. Prohibits any AFDC payment of under $25 (formerly, $10). Requires secondary, vocational, or technical school students not working 20 hours a week to register for the WIN program (Work Incentive Program), in order to be eligible for AFDC. Requires unemployed parents to submit at least 15 letters of rejection weekly from potential employers in order to qualify for AFDC."
