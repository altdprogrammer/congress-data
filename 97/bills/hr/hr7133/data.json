    "text": "Social Security Disability Benefits Act of 1982 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to permit a disability insurance beneficiary who has been found to be no longer entitled to disability benefits to elect to have such benefits continued until the disability determination has been affirmed or overturned on appeal. Provides that benefits paid pursuant to such an election shall be considered overpayments if the decision on appeal affirms the determination that the individual involved is no longer entitled to benefits. Provides that an individual shall be considered disabled for purposes of title II if he or she is not appropriately qualified (based on age, education, and work experience) to engage in substantial gainful work which exists in the region where such individual lives. (Currently, an individual is considered disabled for purposes of title II if he or she cannot engage in substantial gainful work anywhere in the country.) Requires the appointment of experts in vocational opportunities to determine whether an individual is able to engage in substantial gainful work and to provide testimony at hearings with respect to disability determinations. Provides that individuals aged 55 or over with severe impairments shall not be considered appropriately qualified to adjust to sedentary or light work unless they have highly marketable applicable skills."
