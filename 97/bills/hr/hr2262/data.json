    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-03-03", 
    "text": "Soil Conservation Act of 1981 - Title I: Special Areas Conservation Program - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide assistance to farm and ranch owners or operators and public entities to identify and correct erosion or irrigation management problems in special areas (as designated under this Act). Prohibits assistance to: (1) public lands unless they are an integral part of a farm or ranch; and (2) nonfarm or nonranch land unless such land has a serious erosion problem which threatens farm or ranch land. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cost-sharing contracts with such persons for: (1) conservation measures as set forth under this Act; and (2) continuing established conservation measures. Requires a recipient to provide the Secretary with a plan that: (1) incorporates practices to prevent land erosion; (2) outlines a schedule for implementing cropping system changes or other conservation methods; (3) considers local, social, economic, and environmental conditions; (4) allows for varying levels of conservation application as appropriate; (5) allows for wildlife and recreation measures; and (6) identifies methods to improve vegetative conditions, reduce erosion, and conserve water on rangeland. Permits financial assistance to cover the loss of income resulting from cultivated crops to permanent vegetative cover adjustments. Requires the Secretary to: (1) prepare a report respecting the designation of an area as a special area; and (2) submit such report to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and to the House Committee on Agriculture. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into any contracts (involving such land) until the Committees approve such report. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to evaluate the impact of local and State tax structures on the acceptance and implementation of conservation measures. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress by January 1, 1986, and at five-year intervals thereafter. Title II: Matching Grants for Conservation Activities - Directs the Secretary to make annual matching grants to county conservation boards for: (1) soil erosion control; (2) cropland, forest, pasture, or rangeland improvements; (3) water conservation and quality improvement; (4) agricultural land preservation; and (5) demonstration projects. Permits such grants for: (1) fish and wildlife habitat improvement; (2) animal waste management; (3) watershed and flood protection; (4) sediment and stormwater control in urbanizing areas; and (5) natural resources aspects of rural planning. Prohibits a county conservation board from receiving a grant unless it: (1) has a current long-range program; (2) has a current annual work plan; and (3) has arranged for equal matching funds or in kind services. Provides that grants may be given for two years to develop such a program and plan. Requires not more than 25 percent of State or local funds for a component of the work plan determined by the Secretary to have a national objective. Sets forth the composition of such county conservation boards. Authorizes long-term agreements of up to ten years. Requires a recipient board to maintain records as the Secretary prescribes and to provide access to them for audits or examinations. Authorizes necessary appropriations. Prohibits appropriations after fiscal year 1992. Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and to the House Committee on Agriculture by January 1, 1986, and again by January 1, 1991. Title III: Conservation Loan Program - Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to direct the Corporation, beginning October 1, 1981, to make loans (up to ten years) to agricultural producers for conservation measures recommended by the applicable county and State committees. Requires loans in excess of $10,000 to be secured. Limits: (1) loans to any one producer in a fiscal year to $25,000; and (2) the total amount of loans in a fiscal year to $200,000,000. Title IV: Volunteers for Conservation - Directs the Secretary to establish a volunteer program. States that such volunteers shall not be considered Federal employees except for provisions relating to compensation for injury and tort claims. Authorizes necessary appropriations. Title V: Reservoir Sedimentation Reduction Program - Authorizes the Secretary to develop a reservoir sediment reduction program to be implemented on no more than five public reservoirs with surrounding soil erosion problems. Requires the Secretary to: (1) prepare a plan with the assistance of interested State and local entities for each such reservoir; and (2) submit such plan to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and to the House Committee on Agriculture. Prohibits implementation of any such plan without the Committees' approval. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983-1987. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress by January 1, 1987."
