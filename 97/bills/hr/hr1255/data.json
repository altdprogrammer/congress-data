Requires the Mayor, not later than February 1 of each year, to submit to the President, the Comptroller General, and the City Council a statement of the forgone tax revenues and the value of certain unreimbursed services provided by the District. Directs the Comptroller General, by April 1 of each year, to certify to the Secretary the total amount of such tax revenues and unreimbursed services. Makes such amount the amount of the Federal payment to the District for the subsequent fiscal year. Directs the Comptroller General to submit a copy of such certification to the Mayor, the Council, the President, and the Congressional committees on appropriations. Authorizes the appropriation of a sum for such Federal payment for fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Directs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia, in consultation with the Mayor, to study, during the first session of the One-hundredth Congress, the operation of this Act."
