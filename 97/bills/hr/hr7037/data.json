    "text": "Replacement Motor Fuels Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to promote the development and use of substitute motor fuels. Requires the program to promote the replacement of gasoline with a substitute motor fuel containing the maximum percentage of replacement fuel which is economically and technically feasible. Defines \"replacement fuel\" as alcohol or another liquid produced from coal, oil, shale, or other substances for the purpose of mixing with gasoline to be used as motor fuel. Directs the Secretary to establish production goals for the production of replacement fuel. Requires replacement fuel sold by oil refiners to constitute specified percentages of sales. Sets a minimum production goal of ten percent by 1990. Establishes a goal of 20 percent by 1995, but authorizes another goal if 20 percent is inappropriate. Requires refiners to report annually to the Secretary. Grants the Secretary authority to assess penalties for the violation of the sales requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983."
