    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide for a combined acreage limitation and diversion program for the 1983 rice crop if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the 1982 rice crop will exceed a specified number of bushels. Makes 1983 price support eligibility dependent upon compliance with such program. Makes the 1983 through 1985 rice acreage bases the same as the 1982 base. Requires the Secretary to make crop retirement and conservation payments available to any rice producer who is participating in the 1983 acreage limitation program. Sets the payment rate at $3.50 per hundredweight."
