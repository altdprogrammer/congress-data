    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Ocean Dumping Amendments Act of 1982 - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to include \"wetlands\" among the factors considered in assessing the effects of dumping. Makes dumping site designations by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandatory. Includes the following factors in dump site selection: (1) waste types and quantities; (2) detoxification ability of site water; (3) importance of the site to the surrounding biological community; and (4) effects on human health and adjacent ecosystems. Requires the Administrator at appropriate sites to: (1) periodically monitor or cause to be monitored, the effects of the dumping; and (2) make three-year dumping estimates. States that the Administrator shall close a site or limit dumping as necessary. Requires the Administrator or the Secretary of the Army to impose on permittees any special provisions deemed necessary to minimize the harm from dumping. Makes permit processing fees mandatory. Authorizes the Administrator or Secretary to: (1) issue interim permits (two-year renewable validity) for dumping materials not in compliance with specified environmental factors; and (2) specify measures to be taken by the permittee to find alternative disposal methods, eliminate contaminants, or recycle such materials. Adopts a two-year moratorium on low-level radioactive waste dumping. Requires: (1) a permittee to submit a Radioactive Material Disposal Impact Assessment in addition to meeting existing dumping requirements; and (2) that a copy of such Assessment be forwarded to the appropriate congressional committees. Permits a one-house resolution of disapproval of a permit within 45 legislative days of submission. Sets forth the information to be included in such Assessments. States that the Administrator and the Secretary shall adhere to the requirements of the London Dumping Convention that are binding upon the United States. Sets forth transitional provisions, including \"grandfathering\" (with certain exceptions) specified dumping sites from amendments under this Act. Defines \"monitoring\" for purposes of such Act. Amends the definition of \"ocean waters\" to include \"adjacent areas.\" Grants jurisdiction to U.S. district courts to issue writs of mandamus to compel the Administrator to designate dumping sites. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983. Directs the Administrator to establish and submit to Congress a dumping designation schedule within 180 days."
