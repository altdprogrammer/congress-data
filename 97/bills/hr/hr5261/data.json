States that the product liability cause of action provided by this Act shall be in lieu of all existing causes of action for damage as a result of bodily injury caused by a product. Sets forth Review Panel procedures. Subjects a declaration by the Review Panel that a State plan is not in accordance with the basic standards to judicial review in the United States courts of appeals.
