Requires that such reports be based on data included in: (1) the Federal assistance awards data system; (2) the Federal procurement data system; (3) the central personnel data file of the Office of Personnel Management; and (4) the records of the Defense Manpower Data Center. Requires the Director to: (1) make printed copies and computer tapes of such reports; (2) provide such copies and tapes for public purchase at prices fixed to recover the costs of preparing such reports; and (3) transfer one of each printed copy to each Federal regional depository library and specified congressional committees. Requires the Director to operate and maintain the Federal assistance awards data system established pursuant to the Federal Program Information Act. Authorizes the Director to delegate such responsibility to any executive branch authority. Directs the Comptroller General to make an annual report to specified congressional committees on the consolidation of data, accuracy of data, and adequacy of definitions of local government entities utilized and presented in the expenditure reports required by this Act.
