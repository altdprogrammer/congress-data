    "text": "Entitles a former spouse of a Member of Congress or Federal employee to a survivor annuity to the extent provided in an election by the employee or Member or by a court decree of divorce or annulment. Prohibits any adjustment of a survivor annuity after the death of the employee or Member. Permits an employee or Member to elect an additional survivor annuity for any other surviving spouse, provided that the total survivor annuity or annuities elected may not exceed 55 percent of the employee's or Member's annuity. Requires the employee or Member to provide for such survivor annuities by a specified reduction in annuity or salary or by a lump sum or installment payments. Restores such annuity or salary and refunds such payments if the spouse for whom such survivor annuity is elected dies or becomes ineligible for the survivor annuity before the death of the employee or Member. Declares a former spouse to be ineligible for a survivor annuity if such spouse remarries before attaining age 60. Declares that cost of living adjustments in civil service annuities shall not apply to such survivor annuities unless authorized by the Office of Personnel Management. Entitles a qualified former spouse to survivor benefits if the employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service."
