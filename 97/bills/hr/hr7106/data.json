Allows a supplier to terminate a dealer agreement which contains a specified expiration date prior to such date (or at any time if such agreement does not contain an expiration date) by offering the dealer, within 60 days of the intended termination, fair and reasonable compensation for the value of the agreement. Permits the Federal district court to determine the amount of such reasonable compensation if a controversy occurs. Grants a dealer the right to file an action for damages or equitable relief against any supplier who violates this Act. States that this Act shall not be construed to modify any provision of the antitrust laws."
