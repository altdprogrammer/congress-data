Amends title II of the Social Security Act to entitle a full-time student at a postsecondary educational institution to child's insurance benefits on the basis of student status after August 1982 if: (1) the student was born before the enactment of this Act; and (2) the individual upon whose wages and self-employment income the student's benefits are based earned such wages and self-employment income after July 30, 1965, and before the enactment of this Act. Entitles a full-time student at a postsecondary educational institution who has reached the age of 18, is not under a disability, and was entitled to child's insurance benefits for August 1981 to child's insurance benefits for months after July 1981 and before May 1985, if such individual would have been entitled to such benefits had the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 not been enacted. Prohibits the payment of such benefits for the months of May, June, July, and August, beginning with benefits payable for May 1982."
