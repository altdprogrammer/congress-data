    "text": "Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require title II beneficiaries living in a foreign country to appear before an officer of the U.S. Government in that country at least annually to present evidence of their continuing entitlement to title II benefits. Prohibits the payment of title II benefits to spouses, children, survivors, or parents of insured individuals who were living in a foreign country during the first month of such beneficiaries' entitlement. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish identification procedures for benefit checks issued under title II which have not been presented for payment within six months after their issuance. Directs the Secretary to credit the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund with the amount of all such uncashed benefit checks. Provides for the cancellation of benefit checks presented for payment after they have been credited to a trust fund and for the issuance of new benefit checks in their stead. Authorizes appropriations to reimburse the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for benefit checks issued in or before the twelfth month after the enactment of this Act which have not been presented for payment within six months after their issuance."
