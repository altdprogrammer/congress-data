    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Small Business Salvage Timber Sales Act of 1982 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to offer to sell to small businesses not less than 30 percent of the salvage timber which is harvested from land managed by the Bureau of Land Management and offered for sale in any fiscal year. Provides that a small business interested in such an offer must, not later than 15 days after such an offer is made: (1) certify that it is primarily engaged in the logging or forest products industry, is not owned or controlled by another person or a corporation which is not a small business, and does not have more than 25 employees; and (2) submit a bid which is higher than bids submitted by other certified small businesses and is not less than the fair market value of the salvage timber. Authorizes the Secretary to sell the salvage timber to any one if no bids are received from small businesses before the end of the 15-day period. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirements of this Act in cases of catastrophic timber losses caused by natural disasters, if the salvage timber must be removed in such quantities or so quickly that the application of this Act would be impracticable or would result in significant waste of such timber. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to sell certain individual trees or small numbers of certain trees from national forest system lands if: (1) the appraised value of the sale is less than $10,000 and is equal to or greater than the estimated costs of the sale; and (2) the sale is consistent with multiple use management. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a special small salvage fund into which all proceeds from such sales shall be deposited and which shall be available to pay for expenses related to such sales. Requires the periodic transfer of amounts in the fund in excess of $1,000,000 to the Treasury. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey, without consideration, the Federal interest in certain real property in Lane County, Oregon, to persons claiming to have been deprived of title to such property as a result of a 1957 Bureau of Land Management resurvey if such persons submit applications for such conveyances within five years after enactment of this Act."
