Requires each organization of the Department, through the appropriate office within the Department, to notify in writing the Committees on the Judiciary and other appropriate committees of Congress (including ranking Minority Party Members) of the programming of funds and significant program changes at least 15 days before effecting such changes. Directs the Attorney General to develop by September 30, 1982, a procedure to insure that no person under age 18 is held as a material witness in a Federal or State correctional facility which primarily provides for custody of adult offenders. Directs the Attorney General to report to Congress within 30 days after: (1) establishing a policy to refrain from enforcement of a law because of its unconstitutionality; or (2) determining that the Department of Justice will contest or refrain from defending a law because of its unconstitutionality. Prohibits authorizations from being used by the Department to bring any action to require directly or indirectly the transportation of any student to a school other than that nearest the student's home. Prohibits the use of authorizations to administer any regulation or policy which sets the maximum age limit for an original appointment as a law enforcement officer at any age lower than 45 years."
