    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Fisheries Amendments of 1982 - Title I: Commercial Fisheries Research and Development Act - Amends the Commercial Fisheries Research and Development Act of 1964 to authorize appropriations through FY 1985. Eliminates FY 1983 authorizations for new fisheries development. Title II: Marine Mammal Protection - Amends the North Pacific Fisheries Act of 1954 to extend the General Permit issued to Japan to fish for salmon in the U.S. fishery conservation zone through June 9, 1987, provided that specified fishing fleet measures are undertaken to protect porpoises and other marine mammals. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to determine appropriate fishing improvements. Requires the Secretary to report annually regarding General Permit compliance. Requires the Memorandum of Understanding between Japan and the United States (dated June 3, 1981) to be modified or renegotiated by June 9, 1984, to reflect the provisions of this Act. Requires Senate consent to presidential appointments to the Marine Mammal Commission. Title III: North Atlantic Salmon Treaty - Atlantic Salmon Convention Act of 1982 - Implements the North Atlantic Salmon Treaty. Authorizes U.S. contributions beginning in FY 1983 to the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization. Title IV: Governing International Fishery Agreements - Approves specified fishery agreements with Japan and Spain. Title V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to provide U.S. documentation to two specified vessels. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, as amended, to deem the carrying by a U.S. vessel (from a point in the United States) of waste to be incinerated at sea as transportation by water of merchandise between U.S. points. Sets forth Coast Guard inspection provisions for non-U.S. incineration vessels. Amends maritime tort law to require a foreign worker injured in an offshore mineral operation abroad to first exhaust remedies in his home country or in the country having jurisdiction over the injury site before seeking U.S. remedies. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, to permit U.S. fish processing vessels to carry certain fish processing supplies between U.S. ports."
