    "text": "Amends the Administrative Procedure Act to require each Federal agency to submit a copy of its promulgated rules to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Provides for a 60-day period for Congress to review such rules. Prohibits any rule (with specified exceptions, including limited duration, emergency rules) from taking effect if either House of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving it within such period. Sets forth House and Senate procedure for consideration of such a resolution. Prohibits an agency from promulgating a rule identical to a disapproved rule unless a statute is adopted which affects the agency's authority in the subject area of the rule. Requires an agency to provide a period of at least 60 days after the general notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment on the proposed rule. Declares an effective beginning and ending date for this Act."
