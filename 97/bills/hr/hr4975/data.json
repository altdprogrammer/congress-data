    "text": "Agricultural Fair Practices Act Amendments of 1981 - Permits an agricultural producer association to request accreditation from the Secretary of Agriculture to serve as its members' exclusive bargaining agent. Requires the Secretary to act on such request within 60 days. Requires approval if the association: (1) is producer-owned; (2) has binding sales contracts with its members; (3) represents a sufficient number of producers or its members produce sufficient produce to enable it to effectively bargain with handlers; and (4) negotiates for prices and other trade terms respecting the production, sale, or marketing of its members' products, or for compensation for products by its members under contract. States that accreditation shall be effective for as long as the association meets the accreditation requirements. Requires an accredited association to file an annual report with the Secretary. Gives an association 30 days to correct an accreditation deficiency or to request a hearing after receiving notice of the Secretary's intent to revoke accreditation. Enumerates unfair handler and producer practices, including: (1) coercion; (2) false reporting; (3) bad faith bargaining; and (4) refusal to comply with arbitration. Authorizes the Secretary to provide mediation services when bargaining between a handler and an association reaches an impasse. Directs the Secretary to establish a compulsory and binding arbitration procedure. Authorizes the Secretary to require arbitration if so requested by either party and if he thinks bargaining has reached an impasse. Provides for the assignment and remittance of association fees. Provides an administrative procedure for processing charges of bad faith bargaining. Requires the Secretary to investigate any alleged violation of this Act, and to issue a complaint and hold a hearing if he has reasonable cause to believe such violation has occurred. Directs the Secretary to conduct investigations and hearings as he determines necessary. Permits suits for damages under this Act to be brought in U.S. district court without regard to dollar amounts. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for such violations."
