    "text": "National Anti-Arson Fire Insurance Act - Prohibits payment under a fire insurance policy for a multifamily rental property or commercial property located in an urban county or metropolitan city which meets economic distress standards established under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 if, on the date of the loss involved, the total amount of property taxes overdue on such property exceeds three-fourths of the taxes assessed for the most recent taxable year. Subjects any insurer who knowingly violates this Act to a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for each such violation. Makes an insurer liable to a tenant for losses arising out of a fire if fire insurance proceeds are not payable with respect to the property involved as a result of this Act and the property owner's assets are insufficient to cover the tenant's losses. Limits the aggregate liability of an insurer with respect to a fire at a property to the amount of insurance proceeds that would be payable to the property owner in the absence of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
