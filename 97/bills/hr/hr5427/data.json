    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendment, S. Rept. 97-544) Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act - Amends the Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 to authorize the Board to provide for radio broadcasts to Cuba. Makes providing accurate information to Cuba a purpose of such Act. Authorizes using a specified radio station and frequency for radio broadcasting to Cuba. Directs the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to select a radio frequency which meets specified criteria. Directs the Assistant Secretary to consider all possible radio frequencies and bands. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 to carry out this Act. Earmarks a specified amount of such funds for administrative expenses of the Board. Authorizes other Federal agencies to assist the Board in carrying out this Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State should try to settle U.S. claims against Cuba arising from Cuban interference with broadcasting in the United States. Authorizes the FCC to instruct the Board to compensate U.S. radio and television broadcasting station licensees for the expense of mitigating the effects of Cuban interference. Authorizes the FCC to: (1) establish criteria to evaluate the financial claims of affected licensees; (2) establish limits on reimbursable expenses; (3) prorate Cuba's share in situations involving multiple interference sources; and (4) require affected licensees to revert to original station parameters without further compensation when Cuban interference ends. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should establish a task force to: (1) analyze the level of Cuban interference experienced by U.S. broadcasters; and (2) try to find a solution. Requires that the board of directors of any corporation established to provide radio broadcasting to Cuba shall consist only of members of the board of directors of the Board for International Broadcasting. Requires such board of directors to make all major policy decisions governing the corporation."
