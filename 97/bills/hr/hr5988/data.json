Title I: Indian Housing Improvement Program - Establishes an Indian housing improvement program to make grants or provide assistance to preserve existing housing, make repairs, and construct or acquire standard housing for Indians. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, upon application of an Indian tribe or individual, to make grants or provide assistance to assist Indian families who are not eligible for housing assistance under titles II or III of this Act because of low income or extremely isolated circumstances.

Permits the sale of a house constructed, acquired, or repaired pursuant to this title if the sale price is not less than the value of the assistance reduced five percent per year for 20 years. Requires that the amount of such minimum sale price be reimbursed to the United States and credited to the appropriation authorized under this title.

Provides for a period of notice, prior to attachment of trust funds, during which a tribe or Indian family may: (1) pay the amount in default; (2) negotiate a repayment schedule; or (3) institute administrative appeals or judicial actions. Prohibits the Secretary, from refusing to execute a housing assistance contract, under this title on the basis that a tribe or Indian family has no trust funds to their credit. Sets forth requirements relating to: (1) disbursements from the fund; (2) construction or acquisition contracts; (3) final plans and specifications; (4) fee titles and leases; (5) land purchase; and (6) final inspections and certifications of completions of projects.
