Makes the column one duty on such button blanks subject to any rate reductions that were scheduled before enactment of this Act. Deletes the duty for least developed developing countries (LDDC duty) if the column one duty is reduced to the same level as the LDDC duty. Requires the amendments made by this Act to be considered trade agreement obligations for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974."
