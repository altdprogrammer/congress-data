Limits the total amount of pension subject to court order to 50 percent. States that court orders for payments to more than one spouse shall be satisfied on a first-come-first-served basis. Empowers the Secretary to determine which court order shall be honored in the event of conflicting orders regarding one spouse. Entitles specified former spouses to coverage under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) for 90 days after the decree or longer if such spouse is being treated for a pre-existing medical condition. Entitles members or former members with a former spouse to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan. Amends the Social Security Act to exclude payments from a military pension made to a former spouse from specified child support and alimony enforcement proceedings."
