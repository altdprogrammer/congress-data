Adds to such forests all Bureau of Land Management lands falling within their boundaries. Provides for the transfer of certain lands, formerly within the San Juan National Forest, to the Bureau of Land Management. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to retain jurisdiction over lands added to the San Juan National Forest until an agreement is reached with the Secretary of Agriculture on the transfer of jurisdiction to the Department of Agriculture. Directs, for purposes of Federal money allocations, that such boundary modifications be treated as if they were the boundaries of such forests on January 1, 1965. Provides that certain lands made a part of the national forest system by this Act, shall be studied in conjunction with the West Needle Wilderness Study Area in accordance with provisions of the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1980. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress by December 31, 1983, on the suitability of including such lands in the National Wilderness Preservation System."
