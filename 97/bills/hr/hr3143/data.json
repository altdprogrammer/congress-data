    "text": "Mass Transportation Maintenance Assistance Act of 1981 - Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to local public bodies for maintenance expenses of mass transportation systems. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for fiscal years 1983 through 1986. Allocates ten percent of such appropriation to States according to specified formula. Limits the expenditure of such funds to urbanized areas with populations of less than 200,000 which have maintenance programs approved under this Act. Apportions the remainder of such appropriations to urbanized areas with populations of over 200,000. Limits to 15 percent of operating costs the amount of such grants for maintenance expenses. Directs the Secretary to develop a system of measuring improved efficiency of mass transportation systems resulting from such maintenance programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for the purchase of buses and related equipment and the construction of bus related facilities. Authorizes appropriations, to remain available until expended, for such grants for fiscal years 1983 through 1986. Sets forth an apportionment formula for such funds. Directs a Governor to: (1) take service based factors into account when distributing such funds; and (2) report annually to the Secretary concerning such allocations. Directs that sums apportioned under this Act shall be available for obligation by the Governor or designated recipient for three years following the close of the fiscal year for which they were apportioned. Limits the Federal share of any project for: (1) the payment of maintenance expenses to 75 percent; and (2) the purchase of buses and related equipment to 80 percent. Specifies criteria by which a grant applicant shall be found eligible for approval. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983 through 1986 for formula grants for areas other than urbanized areas. Limits the application of this Act to amounts apportioned for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1982."
