Amends the National Labor Relations Act to include the United States and the legislative branch of the Federal Government as employers subject to the prohibition against unfair labor practices declared in that Act. Extends the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the employees of any unit of the legislative branch of the Federal Government whether a unit has positions in the competitive civil service or not. Includes the United States and the legislative branch of the Federal Government within the definition of the term \"employer\" in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Applies the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act to the legislative branch. Repeals the exemption of the Vice President, Members of Congress, and legislative branch employees from the social security taxing and benefit provisions."
