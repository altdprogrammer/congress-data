    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) continue ozone protection studies and research while increasing actual measurements of stratospheric ozone and improving methods of monitoring potential trends in such measurements; and (2) contract with the National Academy of Sciences, in consultation with the Administrators of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to (a) continue review and research, (b) determine the extent, nature, and causes of changes in stratospheric ozone concentration (with particular attention to the effects of chlorofluorocarbons), (c) investigate unreasonable effects on health and the environment, and (d) report to the Administrator and the Congress. Directs the Administrator to report, with recommendations, to the Congress at the end of a 24-month period. Prohibits the commencement or continuation of rulemaking by the Administrator with respect to regulations for the control in the United States of any chlorofluorocarbon until: (1) the Administrator, the Academy, and the President have submitted specified reports to the Congress; or (2) the Administrator determines that stratospheric ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons at a rate eventually harmful to human health and the environment has actually been detected. Directs the Administrator to withdraw any such rulemaking commenced after January 1, 1981, and before the date of enactment of this Act, and declares that such rulemaking has no force or effect. Requires that such final regulations be submitted to the Congress and only take effect if both Houses of Congress do not adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval within a specified period. Sets forth procedures relating to such resolutions. Requires that continuing research and monitoring programs be expanded to determine the extent, nature, causes, effects, and associated uncertainties of stratospheric ozone concentration changes. Directs the President, within two years from the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, to report to the Congress and the public on efforts to reach international agreements among the major free-world countries producing chlorofluorocarbons as to the nature, extent, and implications of any threat to the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and the appropriate regulatory action to be taken. Prohibits States or local governments from adopting or attempting to enforce any regulations (except ones controlling halocarbon use as an aerosol propellant) respecting the control of chlorofluorocarbons to protect the stratosphere or stratospheric ozone until the Administrator has promulgated such regulations for such control in the United States. Provides that this Act shall not affect the validity of regulations concerning aerosol propellants containing chlorofluorocarbons promulgated by the Administrator before January 1, 1981."
