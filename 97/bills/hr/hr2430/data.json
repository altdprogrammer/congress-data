Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $400 for the taxable year. Reduces the amount of such credit by 1.5 percent of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $30,000. Provides for the termination of the credit for taxable years ending after December 31, 1983. Provides for the cost of funding such credit through the Windfall Profit Tax Account."
