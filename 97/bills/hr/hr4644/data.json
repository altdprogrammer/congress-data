    "text": "Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to revise requirements for waivers that permit the hiring of 10- and 11-year-old children to hand harvest certain crops for eight weeks of a calendar year. Provides that the submission of signed statements from trained medical personnel in the affected region satisfies the requirement that the Secretary of Labor find that such employment would not be deleterious to the health or well-being of such children. Eliminates a requirement that the Secretary find, based on objective data submitted by the applicant, that the pesticides and other chemicals used would not have an adverse effect on such children. Provides, instead, that the Secretary grant such waivers unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines, based on scientific findings and other technical information, that such pesticides or chemicals may have a significant adverse effect on such children."
