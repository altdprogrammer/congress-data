Requires that any person appointed to such a teaching position receive credit for any sick leave accumulated at a prior job with the Federal Government or the District of Columbia government, or at a job which is determined to have been a teaching position, provided the break in service does not exceed three years. Declares that any DOD teacher who is reappointed to another agency without a break in service exceeding three years shall receive credit for any sick leave or teacher's leave earned while the teacher worked for DOD."
