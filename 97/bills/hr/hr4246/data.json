Specifies allowable delays in computing such time period. Dismisses an indictment or information against a defendant who, through no fault of his own or his counsel, is not brought to trial as required by this Act. Requires that pretrial motions in such cases shall be made within 30 days of arrest, summons, or charge of the defendant, whichever occurs first. Permits a district court to apply to the Judicial Conference of the United States for postponement of the effective date of this Act under certain circumstances. Authorizes the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to make emergency payments to those district courts that require immediate funds to implement the provisions of this Act without reducing the quality of justice in the district."
