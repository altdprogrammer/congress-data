Declares that funds distributed under this Act are not liable to the payment of any previous contractual obligation, except as provided by the governing body of the tribe. States that this Act shall not affect the use or distribution of judgment funds under a specified Act relating to judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or Court of Claims, but provides that per capita payments made pursuant to a plan under such Act may be made by a tribe as provided in this Act if all other provisions of such Act are met. Provides that nothing in this Act, with the exception of specified provisions, shall apply to the Shoshone Tribe and the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming. Directs the Secretary to establish reasonable standards for approval of tribal payments. Provides that the United States shall not be liable with respect to any distribution of funds by a tribe under this Act, where approval is given under such standards. Provides that nothing in this Act shall otherwise absolve the United States from any other responsibility to Indians. Repeals specified provisions of Federal laws which require that payments to individual Indians be made by a Federal Government officer designated or appointed by the Secretary."
