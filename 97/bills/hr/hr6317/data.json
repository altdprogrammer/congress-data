    "as": "Reported to House amended", 
    "date": "1982-05-17", 
    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Armed Services with amendment, H. Rept. 97-552) Uniformed Services Pay Act of 1982 - Title I: Compensation Issues - States that the required adjustment in military pay, commensurate with adjustments made for Federal civilian employees, shall not be made. Directs the President's agent to instead recommend increases in military pay based upon increases for workers in the private sector over the previous 12 month period. Directs the President to transfer to Congress an alternative plan if he considers such recommended adjustments inappropriate for national security or emergency reasons. Makes such alternative plan effective unless either House of Congress adopts a resolution of disapproval within 30 days. States that if a resolution of disapproval is adopted, then the President shall adjust the salaries as recommended. Preempts other rates of pay otherwise enacted. Includes time spent as an enlisted member as well as a warrant officer in computing the basic pay of certain commissioned officers. Extends through FY 1987 enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for the armed forces. Freezes certain travel allowances for dependents and for transportation of baggage and household effects during FY 1983. Authorizes hazardous duty pay for persons involved in testing aircraft or missile systems during which highly toxic fuels or propellants are used. Revises eligibility criteria for certain members' separation pay. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to permit members or former members who would have been eligible to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan but for the fact that they were under 60 years of age to do so. Extends eligibility for a minimum income to widows who were widowed as of a specified date. Modifies the Reserve Officer Training Corps' Scholarship Program to extend eligibility to students whose approved program includes a fifth academic year. Extends eligibility for a subsistence allowance to members of precommissioning programs from 20 to 30 months. Requires as a condition of assistance for specially selected members as cadets or midshipmen that the Secretary concerned have the option of requiring reimbursement should the member fail to complete the educational requirements. Requires such members to accept an appointment, if offered, as a commissioned officer of one of the uniformed services and to serve in a reserve component for a specified period. Title II: Computation of Retired Pay - Requires that years of service for computing retired pay be determined by considering any full month of service as one-twelfth of a year, whether or not a member has more or less than six full months. Title III: Personnel Management Issues - Permits the President, with the consent of the officer involved, to transfer a commissioned officer from one branch of the uniformed service to another. Credits officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Public Health Service with the number of years in service for retirement purposes and, with regard to the Public Health Service only, for purposes of grade and rank when transferred to an armed force. Authorizes the appointment of one cadet from American Samoa and one from the children of U.S. civilian personnel in Panama to each of the military academies. Permits citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands to be appointed as officers in the U.S. armed forces. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1980 to prohibit the contracting-out of a commercial or industrial type function of the Department of Defense if the national defense requires that such function be performed by personnel of the Department. Directs the Secretary to include within a report to Congress an assessment as to which functions necessitate Department personnel performance, including a cost comparison. Extends medical malpractice protection to health-care personnel of the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home. Eliminates the requirement that former military or civilian employees of the Department previously or subsequently employed by defense contractors must report details of such employment to the Secretary. Permits the Secretary of a military department to accept voluntary services for a museum or family support program operated by the department."
