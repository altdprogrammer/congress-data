Permits appropriations for research and development to be used for any items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) which may be required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts, and for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Requires the Administrator to notify the appropriate committees of Congress whenever the cost of a facility exceeds a specified amount. Permits funds appropriated for research and development or for construction of facilities to remain available without fiscal year limitation. Permits the funds for construction of any of specified facilities: (1) in the discretion of the NASA Administrator, to be varied upward ten percent; or (2) following a report by the Administrator to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the circumstances of such action, to be varied upward 25 percent to meet unusual cost variations. Limits the total cost of all construction work to the total of the amounts specified. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development to be transferred to the \"Construction of facilities\" appropriation. Authorizes the expenditure of such funds, together with an additional $10,000,000, to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations. Requires the Administrator to notify the appropriate committees of Congress of the specific nature, cost, and reasons for such construction 30 days before expending funds. Permits each committee to provide the Administrator with a written waiver of such period. Prohibits the expenditure of appropriations for deleted programs or programs in excess of the amount authorized, unless they have been presented to the appropriate committee for a period of 30 days. Expresses the sense of Congress that consideration should be given to the geographical distribution of research funds. Directs the Administrator to charge the Department of Defense for payloads placed in orbit by the Space Shuttle after FY 1984. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure the performance of the requirements of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 during FY 1984. Requires the Director to reserve funds for the United States Fire Administration. Title II: Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) plan for the management and operation of a civil land remote sensing satellite system transferred from NASA; (2) provide for user fees; and (3) plan for the transfer of such systems to the private sector. Directs the Secretary to conduct feasibility studies for such transfer and report to Congress on them by February 1, 1983. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits the transfer of such systems to the private sectors until the appropriate committees of Congress are given 30 days notice of such action."
