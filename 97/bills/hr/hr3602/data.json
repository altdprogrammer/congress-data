Applies the provisions of this Act to any alien who: (1) is a native or citizen of Haiti who first arrived unlawfully in the State of Florida on or after January 1, 1972, and before May 14, 1981; (2) is or has been within the jurisdiction of office number six of the Immigration and Naturalization Service; (3) is not resettled in any foreign country on the date of enactment of this Act; and (4) on such date does not have a lawful status in the United States or has the status of an alien paroled into the United States as a Cuban/Haitian entrant (status pending). Requires the Attorney General to establish a record of an alien's admission as a refugee as of the date of such adjustment. Provides that aliens granted refugee status under this act shall be treated for all purposes as aliens admitted as refugees under the Immigration and Nationality Act, including the purpose of providing assistance to States and public and nonprofit agencies for the provision of cash and services to such aliens."
