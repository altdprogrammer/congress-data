Requires the project authorized by this Act to be integrated and coordinated into other features of the existing Yakima project. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1983 and thereafter such sums as may be necessary. Makes the project authorized by this Act an integral part of the Yakima River Basin water enhancement project if the feasibility study on such project is authorized and an appropriation for construction is enacted. Directs that the State of Washington shall be credited for funds it has provided for Yakima River Basin projects to satisfy State matching fund requirements provided in subsequent legislation for such river basin."
