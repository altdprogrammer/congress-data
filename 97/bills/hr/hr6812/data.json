    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the National Housing Act to permit the maximum mortgage amounts to be increased by the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured. Excludes the increase in the purchaser's initial outlay from the calculation of FHA mortgage limits. Provides for a prorated rebate on the premium to be paid to the original purchaser if the mortgage is paid off prior to its due date. Declares that such provisions shall be implemented only if the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that the program of advance payment of insurance premiums is actuarially sound. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1982 to the Bureau of the Mint for the salaries and expenses of the mints and assay offices."
