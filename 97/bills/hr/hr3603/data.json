    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Food and Agriculture Act of 1981 - Title I: Dairy Production Act of 1981 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to establish milk price supports for: (1) the period through fiscal year 1982 at not less than $13.10 per hundredweight for milk with 3.67 percent milk fat; (2) fiscal year 1983 at not less than 72.5 percent of parity; and (3) fiscal years 1984-1985 at between 70-75 percent of parity. Extends dairy base plan authority. Extends through 1985: (1) the program of price-supported dairy products for the military and veterans' hospitals; and (2) the dairy indemnity program. Encourages wider consumption of dairy products through export promotion and domestic distribution. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to explore domestic casein production possibilities and report to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees within 90 days. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year regarding regional food security aspects of the dairy support program and milk marketing orders. Authorizes the Secretary to sell specified dairy and milk products to the Soviet Union. Title II: Wool and Mohair - Amends the National Wool Act of 1954 to extend the wool and mohair price support program through 1985. Title III: Wheat - Provides for loans and purchases of the: (1) wheat crop at not less than $3.55 per bushel; and (2) 1983-1985 crops at levels adjusted proportionally to the target price of wheat. Stipulates that the Secretary may adjust levels downward by up to ten percent (but not less than $3.00 per bushel) whenever the yearly price for the previous year is not more than 105 percent of the current loan and purchase level. Requires the Secretary to provide producers with the same return they would have received if such loan reductions occur. Authorizes a target price program for the 1982-1985 crops.
