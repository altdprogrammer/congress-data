    "text": "High Technology Trade Act of 1982 - Directs the President to negotiate with foreign governments and instrumentalities to obtain substantially equivalent competitive opportunities through maximum openness of trade and investment. Requires such negotiations to include, to the maximum extent possible, the major developed countries and the newly industrialized countries. Authorizes the President to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements to achieve the objectives of this Act, including commitments to monitor compliance. Sets forth commitments included in providing substantially equivalent competitive opportunities through maximum openness of trade and investment. Authorizes the President, in order to carry out an agreement under this Act, to proclaim tariff changes and to use procedures contained in the Trade Act of 1974 if changes in U.S. law are required. Authorizes the President to enter into an agreement under this Act even if the President determines that U.S. firms would not promptly receive substantially competitive trade and/or investment opportunities. Makes such an agreement subject to specified conditions. Requires the President to report to Congress on whether the major developed countries and the newly industrialized countries have taken sufficient actions to provide substantially equivalent competitive opportunities for U.S. high technology exports and investments. Provides for consultations if such actions have not been taken. Authorizes the President to establish substantially equivalent competitive opportunities if consultations do not establish such opportunities. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to report annually to Congress on: (1) the extent to which any major developed country or advanced developing country utilizes industrial policies or measures that distort international trade and that have significant adverse effects on the U.S. high technology industry; and (2) the measures the United States is taking to remedy such adverse effects. Sets forth material to be analyzed in such report. Directs the President to take whatever steps are necessary to eliminate foreign industrial policies which: (1) significantly distort international trade or investment to the detriment of any U.S. high technology industry; and (2) may result in sales of articles at less than fair value in the U.S. market or subsidization of imports and cause material injury to any U.S. high technology industry. Authorizes the President to negotiate agreements providing for the expansion of product categories or to take unilateral action to prevent the distorting effects of restrictions at one level of trade on the trade patterns at another level. Directs the Secretary to analyze high technology trade and investment patterns, to evaluate the equivalency of competitive opportunities, and to further the objectives of this Act. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President on such analysis. Directs the President to report annually to Congress on the measures contained in the Secretary's report that the President considers to be a violation of international agreements or which are otherwise unjustifiable and a burden on U.S. commerce. Directs the Secretary and the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to establish a High Technology Industry Advisory Committee. Requires the USTR and the Secretary to consult with the Committee on negotiating positions, concluding agreements, imposing restrictions under this Act, and monitoring the results of any such agreement or restriction. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to add to the actions the President may take to enforce U.S. trade rights and respond to foreign trade practices. Authorizes the President to impose restrictions on direct investment by foreigners in the United States and on access by foreigners to joint research and development activities in the United States."
