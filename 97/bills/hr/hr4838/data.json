    "text": "Regulatory Control Act of 1981 - Directs each Federal agency to transmit a copy of each promulgated rule to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Declares that a rule shall not become effective unless it is not disapproved by Congress within specified time periods. Permits a rule to become effective: (1) 30 days after it is transmitted to Congress if the committee of either House having primary legislative jurisdiction over the rule does not announce that it will review the rule; (2) 60 days thereafter if either committee reviews the rule but neither House adopts a resolution disapproving it; (3) 90 days thereafter if one House adopts such a resolution and the other House does not; or (4) upon the rejection of such a resolution by either House. Prohibits a rule from becoming effective if within 90 days after it is transmitted to Congress: (1) both Houses adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval in the case of: (a) an executive agency rule containing provisions that exceed statutory authority or are contrary to law or inconsistent with congressional intent; or (b) any rule of an independent regulatory agency; or (2) a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted in the case of: (a) any other executive agency rule; or (b) any repromulgated rule. Exempts emergency rules of limited duration from requirements of this Act under certain circumstances. Requires each committee, under specified time restrictions: (1) to review any rule for which a resolution is sponsored by one-fifth of the Members of that House; (2) to announce the review of any rule in the Congressional Record; and (3) to report a resolution on any rule reviewed with recommendations on whether to adopt or reject the resolution. Sets forth congressional procedure for the consideration of such a resolution. Authorizes either House to adopt a resolution requiring an agency to reconsider a rule which has been in effect for two years to determine whether to renew, amend, or repeal it. Directs the agency to: (1) publish notice of any review or repromulgation of such a rule; (2) notify Congress prior to repromulgating a rule; and (3) submit such rule for congressional review. Authorizes an executive agency to bring an action in U.S. district court to implement a rule that Congress has disapproved because it is inconsistent with statutory authority. Terminates this Act at the end of the One-hundredth Congress."
