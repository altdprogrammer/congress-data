Permits rentals pursuant to shared equity agreements. Defines \"shared equity agreements\" as agreements between two or more individuals in which such individuals acquire certain ownership interests in the property and one individual rents the property as his principal residence at a fair market rental. Extends until 1984 the application of the net operating loss rules added by the Tax Reform Act of 1976."
