    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #172 (396-3)) National Energy Emergency Preparedness Act of 1982 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to extend the authority with respect to international voluntary agreements under the international energy program until June 30, 1985. Directs the President to undertake and continue petroleum product acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at a rate which assures that the quantity of petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average annual rate of at least 200,000 barrels per day. Directs the President to assure that quantities in the Reserve are increased at an average annual rate of at least 300,000 barrels per day during periods in which the President considers it fiscally prudent to do so. Provides that the preceding requirements shall cease to apply when there are at least 500,000,000 barrels in the Reserve; except that until at least 750,000,000 barrels are stored, the President shall seek to continue petroleum product acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at the 200,000 barrel per day rate. Provides the Secretary of Energy with authority to store petroleum products in interim storage facilities. Prohibits: (1) limiting the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Petroleum Account so that it cannot be used to meet expenses relating to interim facilities for the storage of petroleum products for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; and (2) requiring any amendment to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan prior to the storage of petroleum products in interim storage facilities. Prohibits obligating more than ten percent of the total amounts in the Account obligated annually for interim storage facilities. Prohibits any action relating to the storage of petroleum products in existing facilities for interim storage being deemed \"a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" as defined in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Considers a facility to be an existing facility if it: (1) is in existence on July 1, 1982; (2) was constructed in a manner appropriate for the purpose of storing petroleum products; and (3) is not modified after July 1, 1982, in any manner which substantially increases the storage capacity of the facility. Directs the President to collect information on the pricing, supply, and distribution of petroleum products by product category at the wholesale and retail levels, on a State by State basis. Directs the President to submit a report to Congress containing: (1) a memorandum of law describing the authorities available to the President under existing law to respond to a severe energy supply interruption; and (2) a description of the options available to the President to implement such authorities. Directs the Secretary of Energy to analyze the impact on the domestic economy and on consumers of reliance on market allocation and pricing during any substantial reduction in the amount of petroleum products available and to submit such analysis to Congress. Directs the President to submit a report to Congress containing: (1) a description of the foreseeable situations which could result in a severe energy supply interruption; and (2) the strategy of distribution which could be used to respond to such situation. Directs the Secretary of Energy to prepare a comprehensive study of the potential for establishing a Strategic Alcohol Fuel Reserve."
