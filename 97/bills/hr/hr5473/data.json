Makes grants available on a sliding scale of between 75 and 25 percent of project costs. Provides predevelopment payments to assist eligible recipients in planning projects to be funded under this Act. Includes such payments in the amount of any subsequent grant. Authorizes technical assistance and training grants. Sets forth project selection factors, including a community's income and size and the health hazard posed by inadequate potable water. Requires community input before final project approval. Requires the Secretary to transmit an agenda of proposed rules and regulations concerning rural water supply projects to the congressional agriculture committees within 30 days and semiannually thereafter. Provides for a veto of a final rule or regulation by a concurrent resolution of disapproval adopted within 90 days by both Houses of Congress."
