Establishes a mandatory term of imprisonment of five years for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and ten years for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to cases of first offenders the requirements, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences. Prohibits the granting of parole to an offender. Prohibits the presentment to the jury of any information concerning the mandatory sentence."
