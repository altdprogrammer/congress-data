Title III: Miscellaneous Amendments - Establishes periods of commencement for payments based on an award of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of payments under the Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978. Extends the entitlement of children of veterans who are under 18 to such children who are not yet 19 but pursuing a high school degree and children over 18 who are not pursuing such a degree but who before reaching 18 became permanently incapable of self-support. Reduces the amount of pension receivable during the summer months for the students. Title IV: Effective Dates - Sets forth the effective dates for this Act."
