    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that evidence shall not be excluded from a criminal proceeding because it was obtained in violation of the United States Constitution. Makes the United States liable for damages resulting from a search or seizure conducted by a law enforcement officer acting within the scope of employment in violation of the Constitution. Permits recovery of actual and punitive damages not exceeding $25,000. Authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney fees. Limits recovery by a person convicted of an offense for which evidence was illegally seized to actual physical personal injury and property damage. Makes such action the exclusive civil remedy for a search and seizure violation of the Constitution. Authorizes a Federal agency to discipline an officer who conducts an illegal search or seizure upon a determination, after notice and hearing, that the officer lacked a good faith belief that the search or seizure was constitutional."
