    "text": "(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) Designates the following lands in the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Cranberry Wilderness; (2) the Laurel Fork North Wilderness; and (3) the Laurel Fork South Wilderness. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire: (1) all nonfederally owned coal deposits and other mineral interests within the Cranberry Wilderness; and (2) contiguous interests and deposits outside the wilderness which are owned by the same nonfederal parties or are economically accessible only through the exercise of rights held within the wilderness. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the owner, to determine the present fair market value of the coal deposits and mineral interests and rights to be acquired within one year of the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to extend to the owner and any successors and assigns of coal deposits and mineral interests and rights in the wilderness, upon their voluntary surrender, a monetary credit to be used against bonus payments or rental or royalty payments made to the Government on any mineral, oil, or gas lease or other Federal property held by the owner, any successors, or any assigns. Permits the transfer or sale of such credit at any time by the owner. Authorizes the Secretary to purchase such minerals rights and interests instead of extending the monetary credit. Gives the Secretary and the owner the right to petition the U.S. Claims Court if they cannot agree on the fair market value of the mineral rights and interests involved. Authorizes appropriations to establish the value of the nonfederally owned mineral rights and interests within the wilderness. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the other provisions of this Act. Limits payments to the extent or amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Permits exploration activities in the Cranberry Wilderness to determine the value of the nonfederally owned mineral resources therein. Provides that the second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) shall not be subject to judicial review with respect to national forest system lands in West Virginia. Releases national forest system lands in West Virginia which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in West Virginia reviewed in the RARE II program, and not designated as wilderness, from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in West Virginia without express congressional authorization. Authorizes appropriations to be paid to Pocahontas County and Webster County in West Virginia in lieu of property and other taxes foregone by the counties as a result of the acquisition of the nonfederally owned coal deposits and other mineral interests and rights within the Cranberry Wilderness."
