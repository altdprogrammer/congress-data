Requires the Director to also prepare such report for each State, county or parish, congressional district, and municipality during FY 1983, 1984, and 1985. Requires that such reports be based on data included in; (1) the Federal Assistance Awards Data systems; (2) the Federal Procurement Data System; (3) the appropriate data file of the Office of Personnel Management; and (4) the records of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Director to: (1) make printed copies and computer tapes of such reports; (2) provide such copies and tapes for public purchase at prices fixed to recover the costs of providing such reports; and (3) transmit one of each printed copy to each Federal regional depository library and specified congressional committees, and of each computer tape to specified committees. Requires the Director to operate, maintain, and update on a quarterly basis the Federal Assistance Awards Data System, established pursuant to the Federal Program Information Act. Requires the Director to transmit, quarterly, a computer tape of the data in such system to specified congressional committees. Authorizes the Director to delegate his or her responsibilities under this Act to any executive branch authority, but requires the Director to oversee the activities of such authority and to review any reports of such an authority concerning the Federal Assistance Awards Data System. Requires the Director to designate a single unit to provide for uniformity of data. Directs the Comptroller General to review and report to specified congressional committees on the accuracy, costs, and use of data systems and reports required by this Act. Requires the head of each agency which has compiled or can compile data that would have been included in the Geographic Distribution of Federal Funds reports for FY 1981 or 1982, to deliver a copy of such data to certain congressional committees within a specified period. Requires any agency which fails to provide such information to deliver a statement of the reasons for such failure."
