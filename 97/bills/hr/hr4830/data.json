Directs the the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (\"the Administrator\"), the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to ensure that the comprehensive research plan prepared under the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980 satisfies such policy. Directs the Administrator of NOAA, as director of task force research under such Act, to provide the Administrator with a status report within 12 months of enactment of this Act and once every 24 months thereafter. Directs the Administrator, within specified periods, to: (1) determine whether new measures are necessary; (2) report, with recommendations to Congress; and (3) issue proposed rules requiring measures that may help prevent, limit, and remedy the harmful effects of acid precipitation. Directs the Administrator, in order to prepare such reports and proposed rules, to: (1) contract with the National Academy of Science for specified services; (2) work with the task force, State, local, and foreign governments, and private industrial, environmental, scientific, and international organizations in establishing and strengthening monitoring networks to determine the sources and effects of acid precipitation and other long-range pollutants; and (3) arrange, with such entities, for information exchange and cooperative data analysis to ensure that remedial measures may be planned and implemented cooperatively, with minimum social and economic dislocation and maximum environmental protection. Directs the Administrator, working within the plan and in cooperation with other programs, to: (1) ensure that adequate analysis and comparative consideration is given to institutional arrangements (including cost sharing and capital formation approaches that will minimize unforseen or inequitable economic impacts on particular regions or economic sectors) necessary to implement new measures specified in such reports; and (2) include in the task force's annual report a description of actions taken to ensure such analysis and consideration, as well as any recommendations for legislative or administrative action concerning such institutional arrangements. Directs the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of NOAA, to include in the annual task force report a statement concerning the adequacy of task force resources to carry out this Act."
