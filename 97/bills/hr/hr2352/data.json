    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to take full possession of all Czechoslovak gold located in the United States and to sell such gold in a manner which will create the largest amount of proceeds for investment. Authorizes the Secretary to offer Czechoslovakia the right to purchase such gold at the price at which it would otherwise be sold. Directs the Secretary to invest the proceeds of such sale in safe U.S. or foreign securities the income from which will be used to pay the claims against Czechoslovakia of U.S. nationals and of the U.S. Government. Directs the Secretary to put the income from such investments into the Czechoslovakian Claims Fund. Directs the Secretary to distribute the balance in the Fund at least once every six months. Sets forth the priority of the recipients as follows: (1) to U.S. nationals holding awards against Czechoslovakia certified under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 or holding awards certified under this Act for property nationalized or taken between January 1, 1945, and February 26, 1948; (2) to U.S. nationals holding awards certified under this Act for property nationalized or taken after August 8, 1958; (3) to U.S. nationals for the unpaid balance on the defaulted bonds issued or guaranteed by Czechoslovakia; and (4) to the U.S. Treasury for the value of a specified debt and two U.S. bank accounts in Czechoslovakia. Requires the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, upon application, to reopen and redetermine the validity and amount of specified claims against Czechoslovakia. Provides for the payment to Czechoslovakia of all the proceeds from such gold sale and any balance remaining in such Fund after all such awards have been paid and Treasury Department expenses are recovered. Denies jurisdiction to any court over any claim against the United States for actions taken under this Act."
