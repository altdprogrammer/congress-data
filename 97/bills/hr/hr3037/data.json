    "text": "Import Relief Improvements Act of 1981 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President to determine: (1) whether a recommendation by the U.S. International Trade Commission for import relief is in the national economic interest; and (2) in the event that such relief is not in the national interest, whether alternative import relief is appropriate and whether adjustment assistance petitions will be expeditiously considered. Authorizes Congress to adopt the Commission's recommendations concerning import relief, instead of the President's action or inaction, by majority acceptance of a resolution in either House. Gives the Commission, instead of the President, the authority to determine the quantity and value of imports determined representative. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to deem equally divided determinations by the Commission concerning injuries caused by imports and market disruptions affirmative determinations. Requires the President to transmit to Congress the reasons for disapproving a Commission determination regarding unfair import trade practices. Makes the Commission's determination effective upon disapproval of either House of Congress of the President's action."
