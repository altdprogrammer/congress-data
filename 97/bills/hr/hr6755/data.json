    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Foreign Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 97-666) Caribbean-Central American Economic Revitalization Act of 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1982 for economic support funds to countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Requires at least 80 percent of such funds to be used to generate local currencies. Requires such currencies to be used to support objectives consistent with the objectives of specified sections of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Earmarks specified amounts for: (1) activities carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act dealing with development assistance policy, rural agricultural development, population planning and health programs, education and human resources development, and development of indigenous energy resources; (2) scholarships for Caribbean and Central American students in the United States; and (3) activities of the Inter-American Foundation in the Caribbean and Central America. Limits the amount of funds that may be used for any one country. Directs the President to seek a reasonable balance in allocating funds under this Act between supporting the public sector and supporting the private sector of such countries and between balance of payments support and support for development projects. Requires agreements relating to assistance under this Act to emphasize using assistance in a manner that will not cause serious injury to sales of U.S. farm products. Prohibits using funds under this Act for aid to Haiti until the President has certified to Congress that Haiti has met certain fiscal performance targets established by the International Monetary Fund. Authorizes providing additional funding for El Salvador to facilitate the implementation of that country's land reform program. Prohibits using any of the funds appropriated under this Act for El Salvador unless the President reports to Congress that El Salvador: (1) has not altered the land reform program in a manner detrimental to the rights of the beneficiaries or the potential beneficiaries of the program; and (2) is making substantial progress in implementing the program. Directs the President to include in the annual report to Congress on foreign assistance programs a detailed description of the disposition of the funds appropriated under this Act."
