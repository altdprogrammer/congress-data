Establishes a rate panel to recommend decisions on changes in postal rates and the mail classification schedule as requested by the Board of Governors of the Postal Service. Directs the panel to consider the relative demand for each class or type of mail when making postal rate recommendations. Eliminates provisions permitting the Board to allow a recommended decision to take effect under protest. Requires the Postal Service to provide 60 days public notice and opportunity to comment on any change in postal service which generally will affect service nationwide."
