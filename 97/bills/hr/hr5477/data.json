    "text": "Seabed Boundary Act - Title I: Authorizes the Attorney General, with the concurrence of any Federal agency head who has responsibility or jurisdiction over any seabed or subsoil area, to enter into agreements with the appropriate State officials on the boundary between the areas of the seabed and subsoil in which the United States and the State respectively are entitled to control the exploitation of the nonliving natural resources. Directs the Attorney General to certify and publish such agreement after it has become binding on the State involved. Title II: Provides for the immobilization of such boundaries through proposals initiated by the Attorney General or by an authorized State official. Title III: Permits a State to waive its right to the nonliving natural resources of such seabed or subsoil which would accrue to it as a result of changes in any portion of its coastline. Title IV: Declares that no boundary established by this Act shall affect the location of the territorial sea of the United States."
