Requires that such economic dislocation be of such magnitude that without the benefit of the loans under this Act a significant number of otherwise financially sound small businesses in those areas would become insolvent or would be unable to return quickly to their former level of operation. Limits each loan to a maximum of $100,000. Prohibits the use of loan proceeds to reduce other loans. Permits the deferral of loan repayment for one year."
