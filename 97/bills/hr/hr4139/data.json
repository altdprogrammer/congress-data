Requires any such resolution to contain language which: (1) affirms the necessity of, and the specific amount of, the deficit; or (2) provides that an amount equal to the deficit is to be carried over to future fiscal years, when budget outlays shall be increased by an equal amount. Makes these provisions inapplicable in time of war or other national emergency declared by Congress."
