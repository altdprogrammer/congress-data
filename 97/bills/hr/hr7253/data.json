Requires the Administrator to certify those dwellings which meet energy efficiency standards for purposes of this Act. Permits the Administrator to purchase such debt instruments only if the total of any other loans issued for the first purchase of the dwellings involved does not exceed the maximum mortgage level for Federal Housing Administration mortgages."
