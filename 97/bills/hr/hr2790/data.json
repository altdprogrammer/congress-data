Entitles eligible members who enlist for two or more years to 18 months of educational assistance at the end of the first 24 months of active duty, one-half month of educational assistance for each month served during a third 12-month period, and one month of assistance upon the completion of two years of service and one month of such assistance for each three additional months of service. Limits educational assistance entitlements to a maximum of 36 months and authorizes educational assistance allowances for veterans and certain members pursuing a program of education under this title. Limits assistance to the date ten years beyond an eligible person's last discharge or release from active duty.

Prohibits dual participation in programs provided by this Act for persons who enlist in the Armed Forces after December 31, 1981. Title II: Educational Leaves of Absence for Members of the Armed Forces - Permits the Secretary to grant any eligible member a leave of absence from military duties for the pursuit of a program of education for up to 12 months.
