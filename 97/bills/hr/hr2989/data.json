    "text": "PATH Crisis Prevention Act of 1981 - Sets forth the findings of Congress in regard to the commuter rail service provided by the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) to the States of New Jersey and New York. Authorizes the President, in the case of a labor dispute between PATH and its employees not resolved under the procedures of the Railway Labor Act, to direct each party to submit a final offer to the National Mediation Board. Directs the Board, if no settlement is reached within a specified period, to refer the dispute to the emergency board created to investigate and report on such dispute under such Act. Specifies that such emergency board shall, within 30 days, select one of such final offers for settlement of the dispute. Requires that a hearing be held prior to such selection so that each party may be heard. Sets forth factors to be considered by the board in making its determination. Prohibits the board from altering the final offer that it selects. Declares the selection of such final offer to be conclusive unless found to be arbitrary and capricious by an appropriate district court. Imposes penalties on PATH officers or employees who fail to comply with the provisions of this Act. Permits any person adversely affected by such noncompliance to bring an injunctive action in the appropriate district court."
