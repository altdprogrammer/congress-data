    "text": "Helium-Energy Act of 1980 - Title I: Helium-Energy Provisions - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Helium Reserve for the storage of helium to assure that adequate supplies of helium are available for future energy and conservation purposes. Provides that the Reserve shall consist of: (1) helium owned by the United States prior to enactment; (2) helium purchased by the Secretary at not more than one dollar per thousand cubic feet and with a right to repurchase from the Reserve the quantity extracted in plants owned or operated by the Secretary; and (3) helium acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the Secretary's authority under this Act to acquire helium in the event that storage goals for the reserve are not met. Directs the Secretary to attempt to enter into an agreement with the owner of any helium extraction plant the operation of which is economically feasible to: (1) operate the plant and sell the helium to the Secretary; or (2) permit the Secretary to operate the plant, provided the owner is reasonably and justly compensated. Directs the Secretary to acquire a helium extraction plant by eminent domain if the plant owner fails to enter into such an agreement. Requires compensation of the plant owner if eminent domain is exercised. Directs the Secretary to determine whether the goals of the Reserve are being met. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire sufficient amounts of helium in deposits from which helium is not being produced and conserve it in place or extract it and, if necessary, construct helium extraction plants, if the Helium Reserve goals are not being met. Prohibits the Secretary from operating any such plant directly unless the Secretary has taken steps to provide for such operation by a non-Federal entity pursuant to a contract. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire helium for the Helium Reserve by purchase at fair market value in addition to the methods already described. Provides that rights of repurchase shall be exercised on a first-in, first-out basis and the price at which the helium may be sold shall be determined on the basis of the amount necessary to recover the amount paid to the seller, the direct costs of storage, and any processing or transportation services. Authorizes the Secretary to sell helium in the Reserve which is owned by the United States and which is not subject to right of repurchase only if: (1) the helium is not otherwise available at a certain price in the private sector; (2) the helium sold will not have a significant impact on the development or maintenance of a commercially viable market for helium extracted from the atmosphere; (3) the helium has not been reserved for future needs; and (4) the sale will be in the public interest. Sets forth the administrative authority necessary to establish, operate, and maintain the Reserve. Grants to the Secretary licensing authority over the sale and transportation of helium in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce whenever the President decides it is necessary to protect the public interest. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President and Congress on the implementation of this Act. Requires the Secretary to conduct studies and report to Congress on: (1) additional helium storage sites for the Reserve; and (2) the future helium needs and supplies and the effectiveness of the program established by this Act. Provides that the Natural Gas Act shall not apply to the sale, extraction, processing, transportation, or storage of helium. Authorizes the Secretary to make the storage facilities operated to maintain the Reserve available at cost to any person wishing to store helium if such storage does not restrict or impair the operation of the Reserve. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 to remain available without fiscal year limitation. Makes funds for helium storage facilities available only if they are appropriated after enactment of this Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to include helium within the export restriction exemptions which the President is authorized to make when such exemption is consistent with the national interest and the purposes of this Act. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to establish the Helium Energy Office, to be headed by a Presidentially-appointed Director who shall assist and advise the Secretary on helium-related activities in this Act. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Reserves for purposes of this Act public lands containing helium-bearing natural gas or any helium-gas mixture which are not leased under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. Includes within the reservation of the ownership of helium the right to extract such helium from all gas produced from lands leased or granted for development under such Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations for the extraction of helium from public lands. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to sponsor research on helium supplies and improved methods of helium production, transportation, storage, and use. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1981 to carry out such research. Repeals the Helium Act, and cancels the outstanding balance of all unpaid notes issued under such Act."
