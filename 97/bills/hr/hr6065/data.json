    "text": "Emergency National Forest Productivity Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a program to remove dead, dying, diseased, and downed trees on national forest system lands in order to: (1) make the lands more productive through reforestation and other forms of enhancement; (2) accomplish additional thinning and timber stand improvement; (3) reduce fire hazards; (4) provide employment for communities dependent on timber production; and (5) provide easier public access to firewood supplies. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out such program through a procedure under which purchasers of national forest system timber under contracts awarded before October 1, 1986, may be required to remove residues and yard undesireable materials not purchased by them to points of prospective use in return for compensation in the form of residue removal credits. Provides that such credits shall be applied against the amount payable for the timber purchased. Requires the Secretary to make annual reports to Congress on the programs authorized by this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1986. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer funds from other national forest system accounts to carry out such programs for the current fiscal year."
