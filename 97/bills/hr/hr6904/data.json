    "text": "Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1982 - Title I: Agriculture, Forestry, and Related Programs - Subtitle A: Food and Stamp Program Reductions - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to treat all related persons living together who are not elderly, blind, or disabled as one household. Revises the measurement periods used for each October's adjustment of the cost of the thrifty food plan. Excludes from household income cost-of-living increases attributable to specified provisions of the Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, and to pensions for veterans of a period of war. Changes the date for adjusting deductions in computing household income from July 1, 1983, to October 1, 1983. Revises excess shelter deduction provisions to permit State agencies to use a standard utility allowance which does not fluctuate seasonally. Excludes from such use households not incurring or sharing such expenses. Requires monthly averaging of household income received on a regular weekly or biweekly basis. Requires accessible pension funds and savings or retirement accounts to be counted in determining whether the financial resources limitation has been exceeded. Establishes categorical eligibility for recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) under the Social Security Act. Authorizes State agencies to select certain categories of households which may file periodic reports of household circumstances at less frequent intervals than other types of households. Revises work registration and job search requirements to provide that an entire household would be disqualified for failure to comply with whatever job search requirements are prescribed by the Secretary. Eliminates the exemption from work registration for parents or caretakers of children when the parent or caretaker is part of a household in which there is another ablebodied parent or caretaker subject to food stamp work requirements. Revises the work registration requirement to exempt those individuals employed a minimum of 150 hours per month or receiving monthly earnings which equal the minimum hourly rate established under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, multiplied by 150 hours. Eliminates the requirement for joint issuance of regulations on work registration by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Labor. Provides that college students who are eligible to participate in the food stamp program may not be disqualified when the college student is the parent of a dependent child under the age of six and is not receiving AFDC. Requires that all the income of an ineligible alien be counted as household income for purposes of determining food stamp eligibility. Permits the prorating of benefits following any lapse in participation (currently after 30 days). Prohibits any increase in food stamp benefits to households on which a penalty, resulting in a decrease in income, has been imposed for intentional failure to comply with a Federal, State, or local welfare law. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to limit the operation of house-to-house trade routes to those that are reasonably necessary to provide adequate access to households if the Secretary finds that the operation of house-to-house trade routes damages the integrity of the food stamp program. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring that the States submit, for prior approval, State agency instructions, interpretations of policy, methods of administration, forms, or other materials, unless the State determines that they alter or amend its plan of operation for the food stamp program. Eliminates the requirement that States maintain bilingual personnel and printed material for areas of the State in which a substantial number of members of low-income households speak a language other than English. Eliminates the requirement that State agencies comply with Federal standards with regard to points and hours of certification and issuance. Permits the Secretary to restrict the number of households which may be represented by an individual. Requires expedited service to destitute migrant households or households with no income. Authorizes a State agency to promptly reduce or terminate benefits for any household which provides written information that clearly requires a reduction or termination. Requires State agencies to determine, not less frequently than annually, whether food stamp recipients are in receipt of duplicative benefits. Permits each State to choose whether AFDC and general assistance households must have their food stamp application included in their AFDC or general assistance application and whether food stamp applicants must be certified eligible based on information in their AFDC or general assistance case file. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to require State food stamp agencies to conduct at least annual verification or other measures to ensure that individuals who have been \"cashed out\" of the food stamp program are not also receiving food stamps. Authorizes household information disclosure to Federal or federally-assisted programs. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to use an alternative coupon issuance system if such system improves the integrity of the food stamp program. Increases the penalties for retail stores which violate provisions of the Food Stamp Act. Permits the Secretary to require a retail food store or wholesale food concern to furnish a bond to cover the value of the coupons which such store may in the future accept and redeem. Permits a State to use other means of collection for fraud and nonfraud overissuances besides cash repayment and benefit offset. Allows the household of a disqualified person 30 days to choose between the fraud claims collection procedures. Permits the establishment of intercept systems to recover from unemployment compensation or Federal income tax refunds overissuances caused by fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Requires State agencies to reimburse the Secretary for the value of excess allotments issued to households. Sets forth a formula for reducing an agency's federally-funded share of administrative costs based upon the State's payment error rate. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct a pilot project involving specified employment requirements in each of the seven administrative regions of the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture. Requires the Secretary to study the impact of benefit reductions and make a final report to the appropriate congressional committees by March 1, 1985. Authorizes ceilinged appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985. Requires the Secretary to promulgate guidelines for food stamp workfare programs that would enable political subdivisions to operate such programs in a manner consistent with similar workfare programs which are operated by the subdivision. Eliminates current exemptions from the workfare requirements for food stamp participants who are involved at least 30 hours a week in a work incentive program. Permits a State to exempt such participants from the workfare requirements. Authorizes a State to elect to operate a low- income nutritional assistance block grant program to finance expenditures for food assistance for needy persons. Directs the Secretary to provide such States with a block grant in an amount based on a percentage of the FY 1983 funds appropriated for the food stamp program. Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of an Indian tribe or tribal organization within a block grant State, to reserve a determined amount of such grant for the direct use of such tribe. Sets forth procedures for application and requirements for eligibility for block grants. Prohibits the use of such grants for construction. Sets forth procedures for the Secretary and the Comptroller General to assure compliance with this section. Includes disabled veterans and their survivors as eligible for benefits under the food stamp program. Requires the rounding down of dollar amounts for the thrifty food plan in computing deductions of household income, and in calculating the value of allotments. Makes certain provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 effective on the date of enactment of this Act. Subtitle B - Dairy - Sets the price of milk for domestic needs at $13.10 per hundredweight for FY 1983 through 1985. Subtitle C - Farm Programs - Permits the Secretary of Agriculture, effective with respect to the 1982 crops of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice, to make available to producers who participate in an acreage limitation program established for such crops advance deficiency payments if the Secretary determines that deficiency payments likely will be made under this Act. Subtitle D - Agricultural Export Promotion - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, for FY 1983 through 1985, to: (1) enter into agreements with private trade organizations, friendly countries, and financial institutions, with regard to export credit sales of United States agricultural commodities and products; (2) implement export subsidy programs for United States agricultural commodities or products thereof; or (3) undertake any combination of the above. Title II: Armed Services - Places limitations on the amount of the annual adjustment of retired and retainer pay of members and former members of the uniformed services in satisfaction of the reconciliation requirements of the first concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1983. Title III: House Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs - Amends the National Housing Act to permit maximum FHA mortgage amounts to be increased by the amount of the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time the mortgage is insured. Provides for refunds of a portion of such premium paid if the principal obligation is paid before the number of years on which the premium was based. Permits the implementation of such program only if the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that the program is actuarially sound. Title IV: Merchant Marine and Fisheries - Places limitations through FY 1985 on Coast Guard retirement benefits. Title V: Energy and Commerce - Reduces the size of the Federal Communications Commission from seven to five members. Abolishes, effective January 1, 1983, each office within the Interstate Commerce Commission which was vacant on July 1, 1982. Reduces the size of the Interstate Commerce Commission to seven members with no more than four members from the same political party. Title VI: Foreign Relations - Places limitations on the amount of the annual adjustment of the annuity payable from the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund in satisfaction of the reconciliation requirements of the first concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1983. Title VII: Civil Service Programs - Prohibits the cost of living increases for any civil service annuity from exceeding four percent in FY 1983, 1984, or 1985. Prohibits a Federal employee or a Member of Congress who is entitled to a civil service annuity for regular retirement from retiring on disability. Provides that, for purposes of disability evaluations, earning capacity shall be deemed to be restored if the disabled annuitants income for any calendar year (currently, in each of two succeeding years) equals 80 percent or more of the current pay rate of the last position of the annuitant. Entitles the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, upon request, to receive information on social security, workers' compensation, military retired pay, and veterans benefits in order to ensure the accuracy of information used in administering the disability retirement program. Entitles an individual who is separated from employment as a National Guard technician by reason of being disabled under military standards, but who is not considered disabled under civilian standards, to receive a civil service disability retirement annuity until the individual: (1) is no longer disabled; (2) is appointed to, or elects not to accept, a civil service position at a level equivalent to the level of his or her former position and within reasonable commuting distance; or (3) accepts any other civil service position. Directs any agency actively recruiting to fill a vacant position to consider such qualified disabled annuitants. Revises the method of computing interest on amounts deposited or redeposited for annuity credit into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund after December 31, 1984. Eliminates provisions providing for a reduced annuity in lieu of a deposit for service for which no deposit or deduction was made. Requires that an employee or Member not be in a position which is eligible for a civil service annuity for at least 31 days in order to be entitled to a lump-sum payment for retirement credit. Increases the annuity reduction for individuals who retire before attaining 55 years of age. Makes Federal employees working in Alaska or Hawaii ineligible for round-trip transportation expenses between their posts of duty and their homes in the continental United States. Entitles employees whose posts of duty are in Alaska or Hawaii upon enactment of this Act to such expenses for their next trip. Requires the monthly installments of civil service annuities to be rounded to the next lowest dollar (currently, fixed at the nearest dollar) at commencement and after each cost of living adjustment. Changes the commencement date of a survivor annuity to: (1) the first day of the month during which a retired employee or Member dies; or (2) the first day of the first month after an active employee or Member dies. Changes the commencement date of an employee's or Member's annuity to the first day of the first month after: (1) his or her pay ceases; or (2) he or she is separated from the service. Changes the termination date of such an annuity to the last day of the month before death or any other terminating event occurs. Provides civil service retirement credit for military service to an individual becoming an employee or Member after October 1, 1982, only if a deposit is made into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund with respect to such service. Allows any employee or Member to make such a deposit for military service. Includes such military service for which such deposits are made as creditable service for purposes of determining the amount of a civil service annuity even after the annuitant becomes eligible for old age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) benefits. Allows any person entitled to an annuity on or before enactment of this Act to elect to be exempted from provisions excluding such person's military service as creditable service if the person is eligible for OASDI benefits. Provides for the recomputation of such person's annuity. Precludes eligibility for early retirement for an employee who is: (1) voluntarily separated from the service during an agency reorganization unless a significant percentage of employees will be separated or subject to a pay reduction; or (2) involuntarily separated from the service if the employee rejects a reasonable civil service position. Prohibits a civil service annuity from being increased by a cost of living adjustment to an amount exceeding the greater of: (1) the maximum pay for a GS-15; or (2) the employee's final pay (or average pay, if higher) increased by the cumulative average increases in pay since the employee retired."
