    "text": "Smaller Enterprise Regulatory Improvement Act - Amends the Small Business Act to require each Federal agency to publish semiannually an agenda of those rules which may be proposed during the upcoming six-month period affecting a substantial number of small businesses and small organizations. Defines \"small organizations\" to include unincorporated businesses, sheltered workshops, nonprofit enterprises which are not dominant in their fields and such other groups and enterprises as each Federal agency shall establish by rule. Requires each published agenda to be transmitted to the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comments. Directs each Federal agency to endeavor to provide notice of each agenda to affected small enterprises by means other than publication in the Federal Register. Directs each Federal agency to publish a written analysis prior to the issuance of any rule affecting a substantial number of small business concerns and organizations which considers: (1) the effect of such rule on small enterprises and competition; (2) whether an exemption could be provided such small enterprises; (3) whether lesser compliance standards could be adopted for small enterprises; and (4) the expected nature of reporting and recordkeeping requirements necessitated by such rule. Requires each Federal agency to issue a rule containing an exemption or differing compliance standards for such small business concerns and organizations if it is lawful, desirable, and feasible to do so. States that such small enterprises shall be given an opportunity to participate in agency rulemaking. Requires each agency to review its existing rules and prepare an analysis for purposes of eliminating those rules which are most burdensome to small businesses and organizations. Permits any agency to perform the analyses required by this Act in conjunction with any other analysis required by law. Declares that such other analysis shall not in itself satisfy the requirements of this Act."
