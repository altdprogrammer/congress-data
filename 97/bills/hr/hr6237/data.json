Specifies the maximum amount of the SBA's share of any such loan. Eliminates authorizations for FY 1983 and 1984 for: (1) SBA loans to small businesses located in areas with high unemployment and low incomes or owned by low-income individuals; and (2) SBA loans to small businesses engaged in the design, manufacture, or sale of energy measures."
