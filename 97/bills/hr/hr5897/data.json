Requires such taxes to be imposed with respect to commodities, classes of commodities, and passengers. Prohibits any such tax from being levied on any item with respect to which such a tax has been previously paid. Allows the Secretary to increase or decrease such user tax under certain circumstances. Requires the master of any vessel with respect to which a tax is imposed to deliver to the Customs Service a manifest of the cargo and a declaration of the passengers upon arrival in a port having a deep-draft channel or harbor. Establishes the Deep-Draft Commercial Port Task Force to make specific recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury concerning the classifications and amounts of tax which should be established for commodities. Directs the Secretary to impose a tax on the use of any deep-draft channel or harbor by any vessel transporting property which is to be unloaded at a privately owned port which is not open to public navigation and is not operated and maintained by the United States. Grants the consent of Congress, subject to certain conditions, to the imposition of certain State user fees at deep-draft channels or harbors. Requires the net produce of such fees to be transferred to, and for the use of, the United States Treasury. Prohibits the use of funds from the Port System Trust Fund or the general fund of the Treasury for any approved navigation improvement project, the operation or maintenance of any deep-draft channel or harbor, or any other civil works project of the Secretary of the Army in any State unless such State has port user fees in effect not later than two years after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to collect and enforce such State port user fees. Establishes the Port System Trust Fund within the Treasury. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on Trust Fund operations. Makes amounts in the Trust Fund available for: (1) navigation improvement projects; and (2) operation and maintenance of specified channels and harbors, including those in the Saint Lawrence Seaway, Great Lakes, or their connecting waters. Sets the Federal share of any approved navigation improvement project at 90 percent. Revises financing procedures of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. Terminates Corporation obligations outstanding on the effective date of this Act. Title II: Construction and Financing of Navigation Improvement Projects to Increase the Depth of Deep-Draft Channels and Harbors to More Than Forty-Five Feet - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to expedite construction of approved navigation improvement projects if the appropriate State port authority enters into a specified agreement with the Secretary. Requires such port authority to reimburse the United States for 100 percent of construction, operation, and maintenance costs. Allows State port authorities to construct approved navigation improvement projects at their own expense and to finance such construction through the adoption of duties of tonnage. Grants the consent of Congress, subject to certain conditions, to the levying by the States of such duties of tonnage. Directs the Comptroller General to audit the operations of such State port authorities and to report to Congress thereon. Sets forth enforcement procedures concerning such duties of tonnage. Title III: Expedited Procedure for Approval of Navigation Improvement Projects and Related Landside Facilities Projects - Directs the Secretary to establish a project schedule for all agency decisions relating to navigation improvements and landside facilities projects. Authorizes the Secretary to modify the project schedule at any time. Describes procedures concerning judicial review of final agency decisions covered by a project schedule."
