    "text": "Dairy Stabilization Act of 1982 - Amends the Agriculture Act of 1949 to revise the method of determining milk price support levels for FY 1983 through 1985. Sets the price of milk for domestic needs: (1) at $13.10 per hundredweight for FY 1983; and (2) at the percentage of parity for FY 1984 and 1985 which $13.10 represented as of October 1, 1982. Declares that price support for milk shall be provided through the purchase of milk and milk products by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) under borrowing authority approved by Congress and repayments from the National Dairy Board established by this Act. Authorizes the Board to make payments to milk marketers whose levels of marketing have been reduced from the levels of the prior fiscal year. Sets forth the method of determining such payments. Authorizes the CCC to increase its milk purchases in the event of an increase in dairy product imports. Establishes a National Dairy Board to: (1) determine the relative proportions of milk to which the price support levels will apply and the producer responsibility for dairy product purchases; (2) establish a uniform rate by which the price paid farmers for milk in excess of domestic commercial market needs shall be reduced to achieve the price support provided by this Act and announce such rate before October 1 of each year; (3) dispose of dairy products acquired by the CCC through authorized price support operations; and (4) remit proceeds from price support operations to the CCC. Authorizes the Board to develop innovative programs for the disposition of dairy products and to make recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture regarding details of the operation of the price support program. Sets forth methods of deriving funding for producer responsibility of program operations."
