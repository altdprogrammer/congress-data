Subtitle B: Implementation of Nairobi Protocol - Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1982 - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to enable the United States to give effect to the Nairobi Protocol to the Florence Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials.

Authorizes the President to limit the duty-free treatment, or temporary duty-free treatment accorded under this subtitle, for certain tools for scientific instruments or for certain articles for the blind or other handicapped persons, if the duty-free treatment of the article: (1) has significant adverse impact on a competing domestic industry; and (2) is not provided for in the Florence Agreement or the Nairobi Protocol.

Title II: Miscellaneous Customs Provisions - Allows certain records concerning business, engineering, or exploration conducted outside the United States to enter the United States as \"intangibles\" which are not subject to the Tariff Schedules. Repeals the provision which made such records duty-free. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to repeal the provision that deemed the nominal consignee of merchandise entering the United States to be the owner of the merchandise. Provides that the required documentation for the entry of merchandise into the United States must be filed by either the owner, purchaser, or a person holding a valid license as a customshouse broker. Authorizes the appropriate customs officer to accept, without liability, the declaration of a consignee that the consignee is the owner or purchaser of the import. Requires that the importer of record must be one of the parties eligible to file the required documentation. Authorizes the carrier of the merchandise to certify any person to be the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the merchandise. Authorizes the customs officer to accept such certification.

(Current law requires the successive bonded warehouses to be located at an exterior port and requires the articles to be exported immediately.) Title III: Implementation of Convention on Cultural Property - Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act - Authorizes the President to enter into agreements with countries which are parties to the \"Convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,\" to apply import restrictions on the archaeological or ethnological materials of requesting countries. Directs the President to seek a commitment of the requesting country to allow exchanges of such materials where such an exchange would not jeopardize such country's cultural patrimony. Prohibits the President from entering into such an agreement unless both the United States and the countries with significant import trade in such materials will apply import restrictions on such materials in concert. Authorizes the President to enter into such an agreement even though a country with significant import trade is not likely to impose import restrictions on such materials, if: (1) the restrictions are not essential for deterring a serious pillage situation; and (2) the application of import restrictions, by the United States and other nations with a significant import trade in such materials, would be a substantial help in deterring a serious pillage situation. Provides for the suspension of import restrictions under such agreements and for the extension of such agreements. Requires the President to report to Congress on such agreements and on emergency import restrictions. Authorizes the President to impose emergency import restrictions. Limits such Presidential authority. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make a list of the materials covered by any such agreement or emergency condition.

Provides for protecting the confidentiality of information submitted to the Committee by private parties and by the Government. Prohibits the importation into the United States of: (1) designated archaeological or ethnological materials, unless the appropriate country issues a document of lawful exportation; and (2) cultural articles stolen from a museum or a religious or secular institution.
