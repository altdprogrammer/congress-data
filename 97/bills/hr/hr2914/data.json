    "text": "Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make grants and loans to eligible applicants for use in drought impacted areas for projects that implement short-term actions to augment community water supplies. Permits such assistance to be provided for any improvement, expansion, or construction of a water supply system and any purchase and transportation of water which will make a substantial contribution to the relief of an existing or threatened drought condition. Permits the Secretary to designate any area in any State as an emergency drought impact area if he or she finds that there exists a major and continuing adverse drought condition which is expected to continue and which is causing significant hardships on the affected areas or that there exists the threat of such a condition. Requires the work on any projects assisted under this Act to be completed on or before December 31, 1983, or within such extended time as the Secretary may approve in exceptional circumstances. Limits such grants to an amount not to exceed 50 percent of allowable project costs. Limits the loans under this Act to a term not to exceed 40 years at a per annum interest rate of eight percent. Requires the Secretary, when making the final determination regarding an application for assistance under this Act, to give consideration to the environmental consequences. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for making loans and grants under this Act and additional sums for fiscal year 1983 as needed for administrative expenses in monitoring and closing out the program authorized by this Act."
