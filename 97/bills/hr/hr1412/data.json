    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-01-28", 
    "text": "New Jersey Radium Pollution Control Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to designate sites at which radium pollution has occurred within the State of New Jersey. Provides that such determination shall be final and not subject to judicial review. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative arrangement with the State to assess radiation levels at such sites and to carry out remedial action to limit the exposure of the public to such radiation. Sets forth requirements for such arrangement. Directs the State to acquire disposal sites for the radium removed from pollution sites unless the Secretary determines otherwise. Specifies that such acquisition is not required if the disposal site is located on land controlled by the Secretary. Directs the State to transfer ownership and custody of the disposal sites and radium removed from the pollution sites to the United States after the completion of all remedial work. Sets forth requirements for such transfer. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire land and interest in lands when necessary for the safe, environmentally sound, permanent disposal of such radium. Specifies that the United States shall pay 90 percent of the costs of carrying out this Act. Authorizes appropriations. Provides that this Act should not be construed to impose liability on the United States for injury to any person associated with radium subject to this Act, nor does this Act affect the legal responsibility of any person with respect to such radium. Permits the Secretary, the State, or any other interested party to bring an action to determine the legal responsibility of any person to undertake remedial action with respect to any radium in the State. Directs that any person found to be so responsible shall reimburse the United States for the amount expended under this Act on such action."
