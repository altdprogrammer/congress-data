    "text": "Amends the Controlled Substances Act to revise the penalties for offenses involving marihuana. Establishes minimum penalties of one year imprisonment for an offense involving from one ounce to 20 pounds of marihuana, three years for an offense involving 20 to 100 pounds, five years for an offense involving 100 to 1000 pounds, ten years for an offense involving 1000 to 5000 pounds, and 15 years for an offense involving at least 5000 pounds. Requires the court when imposing a lesser sentence or granting probation to report a comprehensive statement of reasons for such sentence to the chief judge of the district. Decreases from 21 to 18 years the age of the transferee which triggers the enhanced penalties for distribution of a controlled substance."
