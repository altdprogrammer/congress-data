    "text": "Food Additive Safety Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem any food additive safe if the Secretary of Health and Human Services: (1) makes a finding, based on recommendations of an advisory committee, that the public benefit from permitting the use of such additive would exceed the public risk which might result from such use; (2) gives notice in the Federal Register of such a finding and invites public comment thereon; and (3) issues a final order not earlier than 120 days after such publication in the Federal Register of such findings. Specifies factors the Secretary must take into consideration when evaluating a food additive or its proposed use. Authorizes the Secretary to include in any food additive regulation a labeling requirement to identify the additive and its degree of risk. Prohibits the Secretary from denying a petition for a food additive regulation solely on the basis of evidence of tumors developed in test animals where the dosage levels used on such animals exceed one hundred times the reasonably expected maximum human consumption of such additive. Amends the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act to extend from 18 to 60 months the period following enactment during which restrictions may not be imposed on the sale or distribution of saccharin, or any food, drug, or cosmetic containing it."
