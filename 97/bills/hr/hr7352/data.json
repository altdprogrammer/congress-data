    "text": "The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1982 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to permit the Securities and Exchange Commission, whenever it appears that any person has traded in securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, to seek an order in a district court action requiring the violator, or anyone who aided and abetted the violation, to pay a civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the unlawful transaction. Permits the Commission if such person fails to pay such penalty, to refer the matter to the Attorney General who may recover such penalty by action in the appropriate United States District Court. Increases from $10,000 to $100,000 the maximum criminal fine that may be imposed on persons, other than exchanges, who willfully violate the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
