Requires the Commission to provide for full public participation during the development of such Plan. Requires the Commission to submit regularly to specified Congressional committees status reports on the progress being made toward the completion of the Plan. Terminates the Commission one year after submission of the Plan. Directs the Commission to transmit the proposed Plan to the Secretary of the Interior for review and comment. Requires the Secretary, within 30 days after receipt of the Plan, to submit written comments and recommendations to the Commission. Provides for public review and comment on the Plan. Requires the Commission, within 30 days after the completion of such review procedures, to incorporate into the Plan such comments and recommendations as it deems appropriate and submit the Plan, along with the Secretary's and the public's comments and recommendations, to specified Congressional committees. Establishes the National Hostel System Study Commission to prepare and submit to Congress a National Hostel System Plan. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States, units of local government, and private, nonprofit organizations to defray the costs of improvements in, or renovations of, structures and facilities for hostel purposes. Specifies that such grants may be made only for projects approved by the Commission, and limits such grants to amounts not to exceed $200,000. Sets forth the procedures for applying for such grants. Declares that upon the request of the Secretary any structure declared excess by any Federal agency shall be transferred to the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan for each State developed pursuant to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act address the potential and plans for the location and development of hostels. Allows the head of any Federal agency, upon the application of any agency or instrumentality of a State or local government or any private nonprofit organization, to lease any structures and land to such applicant, without charge, for hostel purposes if the Secretary has certified that the applicant meets the standards of the National Hostel System Plan.
