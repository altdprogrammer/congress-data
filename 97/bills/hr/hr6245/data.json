    "text": "Humane Care and Development of Substitutes for Animals in Research Act - Title I: Development of Improved Testing Methods - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants and contract awards to sponsor research and development of scientific research, experimentation, and testing methods which reduce the number of live animals required and limit animal pain and distress. Requires that applications and proposals for such grants and awards be assessed through peer review procedures and approved by the Secretary. Provides for review of each application and proposal by a special Advisory Panel to the Secretary comprised of recognized experts in various scientific fields. Requires the Advisory Panel to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to research support of nonanimal testing. Authorizes appropriations to make such grants for FY 1983 through 1985. Provides that the Secretary shall direct the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the national toxicology program and shall consult with the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory and scientific research agencies to: (1) promote new nonanimal research, experimentation, and testing methods; (2) evaluate existing nonanimal methods; and (3) develop new methodologies for the toxicology data systems. Requires the Secretary to report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate on progress under this Act within two years after enactment of this Act. Title II: Federal Research Grant Requirements - Requires that a research entity be accredited by a recognized accrediting agency in order to be eligible for a Federal grant for research, experimentation, or testing involving the use of animals. Requires the Secretary to designate as accrediting agencies those agencies which: (1) are able to ascertain the qualifications of research entities to conduct research, experimentation, or testing involving animals; (2) have an accreditation system; and (3) have a system for routine inspection of laboratory animal facilities at accredited research entities. Provides that in order to be eligible for a Federal grant for research, experimentation, or testing involving the use of animals, a research agency must also provide to the agency responsible a statement of assurances that: (1) the research agency has established an institutional animal care committee; (2) the committee will make periodic inspections of all animal facilities of the research entity, review research protocols and practices, and file with the responsible Federal agency certification that such inspections and reviews have occurred; (3) the committee will maintain complete records of its activities; (4) each committee member will be responsible for notifying the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture, the responsible Federal agency, and the applicable accrediting agency of any seriously deficient animal care conditions with respect to the research entity; and (5) the committee will establish courses for personnel involved with animal care and use on humane animal maintenance and experimentation and on research or testing methods that minimize animal use and animal distress. Requires that Federal support be withheld where animal care conditions have been neglected despite notification to the research entity. Authorizes the Secretary to waive certification requirements under certain circumstances. Directs the Secretary to facilitate agency compliance with this title through the establishment of an information clearinghouse on animal research methods and models. Authorizes appropriations in FY 1983 to assist non-Federal research entities in improving animal care facilities in order to reach initial compliance with accreditation requirements. Title III: Special Procedures - Prohibits Federal agency approval of a research proposal involving animal use unless such proposal provides for the consulting services of a veterinarian and the proper use of tranquilizers, analgesics, and anaesthetics where necessary and justifies any anticipated animal suffering in terms of research benefits."
