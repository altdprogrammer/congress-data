    "text": "Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require the Secretary of State to inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services of the use or intended use by any country or international organization of any herbicide to eradicate marihuana in a program receiving U.S. aid for narcotics control (currently no U.S. aid may be used for any such program if the herbicide is likely to cause serious harm to marihuana users unless the herbicide is used with another substance that will warn potential users of the presence of the herbicide). Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to monitor the impact on the health of marihuana users of such a herbicide. Directs the Secretary to notify the Secretary of State if it is determined that the health of a marihuana user has been seriously harmed by such herbicide. Prohibits further U.S. assistance for spraying such herbicide after such notification is made. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress any determination of serious harm to marihuana users. Directs the Secretary of State to report any termination of U.S. assistance to Congress."
