Requires the Administrator to maintain a contingency capacity to assist the Department of Defense in time of war or national emergency. Requires the Chief Medical Director to analyze annually, rather than periodically, agency wide admission policies and the records of those eligible veterans who apply for hospital care or medical services but are rejected or not immediately admitted. Requires the Director to review the geographic distribution of operating beds and the demographic characteristics of the veteran population and the associated need for medical facilities in each State. Directs the Administrator to report annually to the appropriate committees of Congress regarding the number of beds required for the health care of veterans."
