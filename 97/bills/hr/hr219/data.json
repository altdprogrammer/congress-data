    "text": "Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to establish, by rule, criteria to be used in determining the air navigation facilities and personnel authorized to be provided an airport under this Act. Permits variation from such criteria if required by safety conditions. Requires the Administrator to transmit a statement with respect to such rule to the Senate and the House of Representatives before prescribing any rule. Provides for veto of such proposed rule by disapproval by either House of Congress within 60 days. Declares any motion to consider a reported disapproval resolution highly privileged and nondebatable. Prohibits the Administrator from prescribing any rule which is disapproved. Makes this authority subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act."
