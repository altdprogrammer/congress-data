    "text": "Senior Citizens Environmental Employment Act of 1982 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop opportunities for senior citizens to participate in programs designed to assist Federal, State, and local environmental agencies in carrying out pollution control programs. Requires that such programs: (1) be designed in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the Administration on Aging; and (2) ensure that program participants meet participant eligibility requirements under the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Allows such program to include (but does not limit it to) projects such as: (1) air monitoring and emission testing; (2) pesticides inventory and control; (3) water quality or supply sampling and monitoring; (4) technical libraries and public information; (5) carcinogenic survey and followup; (6) hazardous materials routing survey; (7) rural health screening and migrant workers; and (8) noise abatement and control. Directs the Administrator of the EPA to report to the Congress within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Directs the Administrator of EPA to: (1) commence negotiations within 30 days of enactment with the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the Administration on Aging to develop rules and regulations for establishment of the Corps; and (2) consult with affected and interested representatives of national aging organizations and State and local environmental agencies. Authorizes the Administrator of the EPA to: (1) enter into agreements with public and private institutions and individuals for an effective system of using senior citizens eligible for participation in environmentally related programs under the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 and CETA; (2) make grants or cooperative agreements to carry out this Act; (3) maintain Corps enrollees within the EPA and with State and local environmental agencies; and (4) train Corps enrolles. Prohibits funding under this Act for any State or local environmental agency for employment of an enrollee which would: (1) displace current agency employees, partially or totally; (2) occur while any other person is in a layoff status from a substantially equivalent job with the agency; or (3) impair existing contracts for services. Authorizes appropriations in FY 1982 through FY 1985 to the Administrator of the EPA to carry out the administrative provisions of this Act. Declares that environmentally related programs described under this Act are fully eligible for funding made available through the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 and CETA."
