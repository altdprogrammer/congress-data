    "text": "Joint Chiefs of Staff Reorganization Act of 1982 - Permits a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to submit dissenting military opinions to the Secretary of Defense and then to the President. Permits the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to provide the Secretary and, when appropriate, the President with military advice in his own right. Establishes the position of Deputy Chairman to be appointed by the President and to be a member of a different armed force from the Chairman's. Requires the Deputy Chairman to perform the duties of the Chairman when absent but prohibits the Deputy from exercising military command over the Joint Chiefs or any of the armed forces. Fixes the period of assignment to the Joint Staff at three years peacetime, and unlimited during time of war. States that such members serve at the discretion of the Secretary rather than that of the Chairman. Increases from 30 to 100 the number of officers that may be recalled to Joint Staff duty in less than three years. Provides each officer serving as a chief of service or as a commander of a unified or specified command with an opportunity to provide formal comments on any report or recommendation from the Joint Staff to the Joint Chiefs. Makes the Secretary responsible for the operation of the Joint Staff so as to provide unified strategic direction of the combatant forces."
