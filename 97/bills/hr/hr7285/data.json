    "text": "Creates a presumption of service-connected disability for compensation purposes for any veteran who was exposed to radiation or toxic chemicals while actively serving in the armed forces and who is now suffering from a disability or disorder symptomatic of such exposure. Maintains such presumption even in the absence of records. Entitles to disability or death compensation and to dependency and indemnity compensation any children of such a veteran with a disability or defect which may reasonably be determined to have been caused by genetic damage in the veteran. Directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to carry out a comprehensive program to screen veterans who may have been exposed to radiation or toxic chemicals during their active service to determine whether they incurred a disease or disability from such exposure. Requires the Administrator to provide outreach and counseling services. Directs the Administrator to establish a research and training program in the diagnosis and treatment of disabilities caused by exposure to radiation. Requires the establishment of a centralized registry of claims before the Veterans Administration or other agencies arising out of actual or possible exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals. Requires the Administrator to include in the annual report to Congress a comprehensive report on the administration and implementation of such screening and research activities."
