    "date": "1981-07-17", 
    "text": "Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants for demonstration projects for support services and research relating to adolescent pregnancy and parenthood. Includes within such services: (1) pregnancy testing and maternity counseling; (2) adoption counseling; (3) health services including prenatal and pediatric care; (4) education and family planning; and (5) other related health, referral, and educational services. Requires that such projects: (1) provide, supplement, or improve the quality of such services; and (2) use methods to strengthen the capacity of families to deal with adolescent pregnancy or parenthood. Limits the use of funds under this program to: (1) provide services to eligible persons; and (2) coordinate and plan necessary services. Prohibits the use of funds for family planning services (other than counseling and referral) unless not otherwise available. Requires grantees to charge income-based fees for such services. Requires the Secretary to give priority to certain applicants, including those who serve areas: (1) where there is a high incidence of adolescent pregnancy; and (2) where the incidence of low income families is high and the availability of programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents is low. Prohibits grants for more than five years duration. Establishes a decreasing maximum Federal financial participation, which the Secretary may waive. Sets forth application requirements. Requires a grantee to make periodic project reports to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to coordinate Federal policies and programs relating to the prevention of adolescent pregnancies, including assistance to State and local entities receiving Federal aid. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for research projects and information dissemination. Limits such projects to a maximum of five years and an annual amount of $100,000. Requires: (1) the Secretary to establish a panel to review such grant and contract applications; and (2) recipients to transmit project reports to the Secretary. Reserves between one and three percent of funds appropriated under this Act for program evaluation. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Prohibits funds under this Act from being used for abortion related purposes, except for research concerning the consequences of abortion. Repeals title VI (adolescent pregnancy grant program), title VII (coordination of Federal and State programs), and title VIII (study of adolescent pregnancy) of the Health Services and Centers Amendments of 1978."
