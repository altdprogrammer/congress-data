    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Provides that if Koniag, Incorporated, Regional Native Corporation, files with the Regional Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska a list of lands or entitlements to lands which Koniag is willing to convey to the United States, then the Secretary of the Interior shall select for acquisition at least 80 percent of the acreage offered on the list and notify Koniag of the selections. Limits such list to lands or entitlements to lands within the boundaries of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge which have been or are to be conveyed to Koniag pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Requires that, upon determination of the value of the lands selected by the Secretary, Koniag convey such lands to the United States by quitclaim deed in exchange for certificates of value issued by the Secretary. Permits such certificates to be used as payments or deposits in competitive lease sales conducted under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Requires the Secretary and Koniag to enter negotiations on the value of the lands to be conveyed. Provides for the determination of the value to be submitted to binding arbitration if the Secretary and Koniag cannot reach agreement. Permits Koniag to retain easements or rights-of-way in the lands to be conveyed. Provides that Koniag and the Secretary may continue to use the procedures in this Act with respect to future land conveyances by Koniag to the United States. Provides that lands acquired by the United States pursuant to this Act shall become part of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge."
