    "text": "Amends the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act to require that management activities with respect to wild free-roaming horses and burros be carried out in accordance with the resource management objectives for the area established in land use plans. Provides that not more than two such animals may be adopted per year by any individual. (Currently, not more than four such animals may be adopted per year by any individual unless the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture determines that an individual is capable of caring humanely for more.) Provides for the sale of excess wild free-roaming horses and burros for which there is no adoption demand. (Currently, such animals must be destroyed.) Requires that revenue from the sale or adoption of such animals be deposited in the account of the agency from whose lands the animals were removed. Extends the date of completion for the research study on wild horses and burros required under Federal law to January 1, 1985 (currently January 1, 1983). Provides that such animals shall lose their protected status upon their sale or adoption. Repeals the prohibition on the sale of such animals or their remains for processing into commercial products. Provides criminal penalties for anyone who knowingly removes a wild free-roaming horse or burro from public lands without the appropriate Secretary's authorization or knowingly violates a regulation issued with respect to the management of such animals. (Currently, individuals may be prosecuted for willful violations with respect to such animals.) Imposes criminal penalties for the processing into commercial products or the selling of the remains of such animals without authority from the Secretary. Increases the criminal penalties for such violations or for violations of Federal, State, or local humane laws in the case of an individual who previously was convicted of the same type of offense. Eliminates the requirement of public hearings on the use of helicopters or motor vehicles to transport such animals. (Permits the use of such transportation after public notification.) Eliminates the requirement that the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture submit a joint report biennially to Congress on the administration of this program. Requires administrators of Federal lands not subject to this program to consult with the appropriate Secretary before removing wild free-roaming horses and burros under their jurisdiction. Authorizes the appropriate Secretary to remove such animals from such lands."
