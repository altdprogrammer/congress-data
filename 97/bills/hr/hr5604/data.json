    "text": "Title I: Export Trading Companies - Export Trading Company Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to promote export trading companies by providing information and by facilitating contracts between producers of exportable goods and export trading companies. Authorizes any banking organization to invest specified amounts in export trading companies upon notifying, but without obtaining the prior approval of, the appropriate Federal banking agency, if such investment does not cause any export trading company to become a subsidiary of such organization. Allows greater investment by Edge Act Corporations not engaged in banking. Permits any banking organization to invest beyond such limitations with prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency. Requires prior notification of such agencies in specified circumstances. Sets forth further limitations on export trading companies and investments by banking organizations. Specifies factors to be taken into consideration by the banking agencies. Permits such agencies to impose conditions in approving applications to invest in export trading companies. Requires such agencies to report to the appropriate congressional committees with their recommendations concerning implementation of this Act, related changes in U.S. law, and effects of ownership of U.S. banks by foreign banking organizations. Authorizes the appropriate Federal banking agency to exempt from specified requirements of the Federal Reserve Act any loan or extension of credit made by a national or State bank to an export trading company affiliate if such exemption is necessary to finance an affiliated export trading company and does not expose the bank to undue financial risks. Provides for judicial review of denial orders in the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals. Sets forth the grounds for disapproval. Provides for a remand for further consideration by the banking agency. Directs the Export-Import Bank of the United States to provide loan guarantees for expansion to export trading companies or exporters when adequate financing is not otherwise available. Requires such loan guarantees to be secured by accounts receivable or inventories. Directs the Board of Directors to try to insure that a major share of such guarantees promotes exports from small, medium-size, and minority businesses or agricultural concerns. Directs the Economic Development Administration and the Small Business Administration to give special weight to export- related benefits when considering applications for loans and guarantees by export trading companies. Authorizes $20,000,000 to be appropriated for initial investments and operating expenses for each of fiscal years 1981 through 1985. Title II: Export Trade Associations - Export Trade Association Act of 1981 - Amends the Webb- Pomerene Act to exempt the trade, activities, and methods of operation of certified export trade associations and export trading companies from the antitrust laws. Delays the effectiveness of any certificate upon the notification of the Secretary of Commerce by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of disagreement with the decision to issue a certificate. Sets forth the procedure to be followed by any association or export trading company seeking certification under this Act and by the Secretary in issuing such certificates. Permits automatic certification for existing associations. Provides for appeal of the Secretary's denial of certification. Requires firms to report changes in membership, export trade activities, or methods of operation to the Secretary and to apply for an amendment of their certificates. Directs the Secretary to revoke a firm's certificate if it does not comply with the requirements for an antitrust exemption or to amend such certificate so that it does comply with such requirements. Authorizes the Attorney General or the FTC to bring an action to revoke certification. Provides for judicial review of such actions. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General and the FTC, to publish certification guidelines. Requires certified associations and export trading companies to submit annual reports to the Secretary. Requires, with specified exceptions, that all applications for certification be kept confidential. Authorizes the Secretary to require an association or trading company to modify its operation to be consistent with international obligations of the United States. Directs the President to appoint, with the Senate's advice and consent, a task force, seven years after enactment, to examine the effect of this Act and to make recommendations. Makes the amendments of the Webb-Pomerene Act set forth in this Act effective with regard to existing associations only at such time as such associations elect to be certified."
