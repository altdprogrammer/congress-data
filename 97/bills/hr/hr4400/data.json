    "text": "Mobile Source Clean Air Act Amendments of 1981 - Title I: Amendments to Title II - Amends title II of the Clean Air Act (Emission Standards for Moving Sources, also known as the \"National Emission Standards Act\") to provide that where any national ambient air quality standard is established pursuant to such Act for any pollutant, the standard applicable to the emissions of such pollutant shall relate to the achievement of the national ambient air quality standard. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in prescribing any such standard, to consider specified factors, including compliance costs, potential inflationary or recessionary effects, and effects on small business competition, consumer costs, and energy use. Requires that more stringent standards shall not become effective for at least: (1) 48 months after final prescription, in the case of heavy-duty vehicles or engines; and (2) 36 months after final prescription, in the case of all other new motor vehicles or engines. Repeals requirements that standards reflecting the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through application of available technology be contained in regulations applicable to: (1) emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides from heavy-duty vehicles or engines manufactured during model years 1979 through 1982; and (2) emissions of particulate matter from vehicles manufactured during and after model year 1981 (or during any earlier model year, if practicable). Repeals requirements that regulations applicable to vehicles or engines manufactured during and after model year: (1) 1983 require a reduction of at least 90 percent of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions; and (2) 1985 require reduction of at least 75 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions. Provides for notice and opportunity for comment before the Administrator determines that any emission control device, system, or element of design will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety (and therefore may not be used to comply with emission standards). Directs the Administrator to include specified information obtained from manufacturers in making such determination. Excludes methane from any hydrocarbon standard for motor vehicle emissions under such Act. Directs the Administrator to establish an appropriate allowance applicable to the exhaust hydrocarbon standard for those vehicles and engines that emit low levels of evaporative hydrocarbon emissions, except that measurement of such emissions shall not be required in specified new vehicle or motor compliance tests. Revises provisions for regulations applicable to emissions from light-duty vehicles and engines. Eliminates the requirement that regulations applicable to such vehicles manufactured during or after model year 1981 require: (1) reduction of at least 90 percent of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emissions from those allowable under standards applicable to 1970 models; and (2) limitation of nitrogen oxides emissions to one gram per vehicle mile. Provides also that regulations applicable to such vehicles manufactured during or after model year 1982 shall not contain standards more stringent than 0.39 grams per vehicle mile of non-methane exhaust hydrocarbons (exclusive of allowances for evaporative hydrocarbons), seven grams per vehicle mile of carbon monoxide, and two grams per vehicle mile of nitrogen oxides. Revises provisions relating to waivers of such standards. Replaces, as a precondition for such waivers, a determination of a potential for both long-term air quality benefit and meeting average fuel economy standards with a determination of a potential to conserve energy. Makes 500,000 units the maximum number of vehicles or engines of each model to which such waivers may apply (the current maximum is five percent of the manufacturer's production or 50,000 of such units, whichever is larger). Revises provisions relating to any future prescribed regulations affecting the manufacture, distribution, or sale of motor vehicles or engines for high altitude areas of the United States to require inclusion of exemptions prescribed for model year 1982 and to permit specified performance adjustments. Prohibits more stringent numerical standards in regulation of high altitude vehicles of any model year than those applicable to vehicles certified under non-high altitude conditions. Prohibits any regulation requiring the installation, on motor vehicles or engines intended for principal use in non- high altitude locations, of any emission controls needed to meet the applicable standards under high altitude conditions. Includes among prohibited acts the failure or refusal of any manufacturer to comply with requests by the Administrator for specified information on new light-duty motor vehicles and their use at high altitudes. Revises provisions for compliance testing and conformity certification to direct the Administrator to evaluate or to require evaluation of (but not necessarily to test or require testing of): (1) any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine submitted by a manufacturer; and (2) any emission control system incorporated in a vehicle or engine submitted by any person. Prohibits the revision of any test applicable to 1981 model heavy-duty vehicles or engines until after the 1986 model year. Repeals a one-year maximum limit on the period which a certificate of conformity may cover. Directs the Administrator to establish: (1) methods and procedures for making tests for determining average emissions from vehicles; and (2) an acceptable quality level for all new motor vehicles equivalent to the level applicable to 1981 model year light-duty vehicles. Repeals a requirement that all light-duty vehicles manufactured during and after model year 1984 comply with specified emission standards regardless of the altitude at which they are sold. Revises provisions for compliance by vehicles and engines in actual use. Bases determinations of nonconformity with regulations by any class or category of vehicles and engines manufactured after a specified date upon the average performance in testing a statistically valid and representative sample. Permits manufacturers to elect to take other actions, in lieu of remedying such nonconformity, with respect to those or other vehicles or engines, consistent with the purposes of such title. Directs the Administrator to consider the effects on competition, in approving a manufacturer's plan to remedy or take other actions with respect to such nonconformity. Repeals a requirement that dealers furnish purchasers of new light-duty motor vehicles certificates of conformity with applicable emission standards, including notice of purchaser warranty rights. Repeals a requirement that the manufacturer remedy, at its own cost, any nonconformity, during a specified period, of a motor vehicle with emission standards. Revises provisions relating to: (1) State standards; and (2) high altitude performance adjustments. Provides that the foregoing amendments made by this title shall take effect with respect to vehicles and engines manufactured in model years beginning more than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. Requires that the economic impact assessment with respect to any motor vehicle emission or fuel standard or regulation under such title also contain an analysis of the noise, safety, and other factors deemed appropriate by the Administrator associated with application of any technology necessary to comply with the standard or regulation. Directs the Administrator to initiate a study and related proceedings, including appropriate informal public hearings, to: (1) develop alternative and practicable approaches to emission control of any air pollutant, subject to such regulation, from new motor vehicles or engines; and (2) evaluate the existing control program. Sets forth the factors to be considered by the Administrator concerning such new approach. Requires that a report of such study, including public comments, be submitted to the appropriate committees of the Congress within one year. Sets forth criteria for proposed regulations under any such new approach. Title II: Study and Conforming Provisions - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator, upon the request of any national association of motor vehicle dealers with a membership which includes a majority of U. S. retail franchisers selling imported and domestic new light-duty motor vehicles, to compile data relating to the availability and distribution to dealers located at high altitudes of all models of such vehicles manufactured by any specified manufacturer in a specified model year. Authorizes the Administrator to utilize specified information and to require manufacturers to submit relevant information (except information identifying shipments to individual dealers). Directs the Administrator, within six months after such a request is made, to submit to the Congress and publish in the Federal Register a report setting forth the data so compiled, including specified information."
