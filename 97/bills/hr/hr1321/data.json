Requires the Secretary to provide a referral service to facilitate contacts between producers of exportable goods and services and concerns offering export trade services. Permits State and local governments to participate in such export trading companies. Amends the Webb-Pomerene Act to exempt trading companies, solely with respect to their export trade activities, from antitrust restrictions. Directs the President, five years after enactment, to appoint a task force to study and report any recommendations concerning the effect of this Act on domestic competition and the U.S. trade deficit."
