    "text": "Handgun Control Amendments Act of 1981 - Amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to make it unlawful for any person other than a licensed importer, dealer, or manufacturer to receive a handgun from a licensed dealer unless such person: (1) appears in person at the dealer's place of business; (2) possesses a license or permit issued under a law certified under this Act; or (3) otherwise complies with this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to review State laws requiring licenses for handguns and certify those meeting specified standards. Makes it unlawful for a licensed dealer to transfer a handgun to a person not licensed under a law certified by the Secretary unless certain procedures are followed. Requires in any such case that the dealer, before delivery of the handgun, forward a copy of a sworn statement by the transferee to the chief local law enforcement officer of the transferee's place of residence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for an identity and record check. Makes it unlawful for any person to transport any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce if such transportation violates a State law in a place through which the firearm was shipped or an ordinance applicable at the place of sale, delivery, or other disposition. Makes it unlawful for any illegal alien, dishonorably discharged member of the Armed Forces, or U.S. citizen who has renounced such citizenship to possess, transport, or receive any firearm or ammunition."
