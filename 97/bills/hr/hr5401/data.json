Establishes the position of Director to head the National Climate Program Office, represent the Board, and be the spokesperson for the program.

Permits the Office to provide financial assistance for activities needed to meet the goals of the program set forth in such plan. Expands the mechanisms for intergovernmental climate-related studies and services under the program.
