    "date": "1981-01-05", 
    "text": "Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act to revise the definition of \"employee\" to exclude (in addition to the currently excluded masters, or crew members, of any vessel) persons who at the time of injury were: (1) officers or employees of any government; (2) engaged in any employment which is not a direct or integral part of vessel loading, unloading, repairing, building, or breaking; or (3) providing services on or for any vessel less than 65 feet in length, while covered by a State workers' compensation program. Conforms specified conditions, under which compensation for disability or death shall be payable, to the revised definitions made by this Act. Sets the maximum rate of compensation, with specified exceptions, at the lesser of: (1) an amount equal to 80 percent of the employee's spendable earnings; or (2) an amount equal to 200 percent of the applicable national average weekly wage. Defines \"spendable earnings\" as the employee's average weekly wage reduced by amounts required to be withheld under Federal and State tax laws. Directs the Secretary of Labor to publish tables in the Federal Register showing the amount of such \"spendable earnings\" for various wage levels. Entitles an employee to choose an attending physician from an applicable listing established by the deputy commissioner. Directs the deputy commissioner to actively supervise such medical care. Requires an attending physician who refers an employee to a medical specialist or consulting physician to notify the employer and submit a report, with reasons for such referral, to the employer and the deputy commissioner. Requires such specialist or consultants to submit reports in order to collect fees. Requires an employee seeking recovery of expenses for medical treatment or services to obtain such treatment in a specified manner and to provide written notice to the employer within ten days after the first treatment or services. Establishes procedures for providing independent medical examinations when medical questions arise. Entitles employees to specified relief in cases where the workplace injury is the sole cause of an impairment or disability. Provides for reexaminations of such estimates of the degree of impairment due to the work place injury. Repeals specified provisions which made certain physicians ineligible for employment as independent medical examiners unless otherwise agreed to. Requires that 80 percent of spendable earnings be paid to an employee during the continuance of permanent total disability, subject to specified limitations. Requires, for a determination of total disability, that an employee prove by substantial evidence that as a result of the injury, in cases other than ones of loss of two or more specified body parts, he or she is permanently unable to earn any wages in employment. Requires that 80 percent of spendable earnings be paid to an employee during the continuance of temporary total disability, subject to specified limitations. Prohibits such compensation from being paid after the employee attains the retirement age for the appropriate industry and geographical region. Sets the compensation rate for permanent partial disability at 80 percent of the spendable earnings of the employee, subject to specified limitations. Extends such limitations to the \"other cases\" category of permanent partial disability compensation and terminates such compensation after the employee attains the appropriate retirement age. Deletes a provision subjecting such compensation to reconsideration of the degree of impairment by the deputy commissioner. Bars employees suffering injuries in specified categories from seeking additional compensation in this \"other cases\" category. Allows employers to reduce permanent partial disability compensation when an employee's actual wages or wage earning capacity have increased or to suspend such compensation when such wages equal or exceed average weekly wages before the injury. Requires the approval of the deputy commissioner for such reductions or suspensions, with such approval to be reviewable by an administrative law judge. Allows employees whose actual wages or wage earning capacity decrease, solely as a result of the injury, to less than their average weekly wage before the injury to request reviews of their compensation payments. Eliminates a provision for death benefits for the survivors of an employee who had been receiving \"other cases\" category permanent partial disability compensation and who dies from causes other than the original injury. Retains the current compensation rate for temporary partial disability, but subjects such rate to specified limitations. Provides for the designation by the Secretary of an attorney to serve as a special fund representative, with specified powers, upon recommendation by an employer and insurance carrier. Revises provisions relating to: (1) compensation for employees undergoing vocational rehabilitation; (2) the wage earning capacity of injured employees in partial disability cases; and (3) approval of settlements by the deputy commissioner and the manner of payment of such settlements.
