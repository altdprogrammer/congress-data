Nullifies any action taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) which resulted in an exemption from the antitrust laws of an agreement or conduct with respect to a rate, fare, charge, allowance, practice, franchise, or transaction. Declares that no individual shall incur liability under the antitrust laws for actions done in good faith reliance on ICC exemptions. Transfers authority of the ICC not repealed by this Act to the Department of Transportation. Prohibits a carrier from engaging in any commercial activity which undermines or tends to destroy competition, or is discriminatory. Allows a carrier to enter into agreements with another carrier to establish a rate, fare, charge, allowance, division, another payment to a carrier, a classification, or rule related to them which involves more than one carrier. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act."
