Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission, in considering an application for the renewal of a broadcasting station license, from taking into account the following: (1) any ownership interest which is held by the renewal applicant involved in any other broadcasting station or in any nonbroadcasting communications medium; or (2) any participation by such renewal applicant in the day-to-day administration and operation of the broadcasting station involved. Requires the Commission to grant such renewal if such licensee is in substantial compliance with requirements of such Act. Permits the Commission to issue without a hearing a construction permit to an initial applicant if such application is mutually exclusive with other applications for technical factors."
