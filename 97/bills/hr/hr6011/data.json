Designates certain lands in the Bankhead National Forest in Alabama as part of the Sipsey Wilderness. States that the RARE II final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) shall not be subject to judicial review with respect to national forest system lands in Alabama. Provides that the second roadless area review and evaluation of national forest lands in Alabama shall be treated as an adequate consideration of their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Provides that areas not designated as wilderness by this Act or remaining in further planning need not be managed so as to protect their wilderness character pending revision of land management plans required by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest lands in Alabama to determine their suitability as wilderness without express congressional authorization."
