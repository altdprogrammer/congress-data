    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-10-01", 
    "text": "Clean Campaign Act of 1982 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a candidate for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress or any authorized political committee from accepting contributions from non-party multicandidate political committees aggregating more than $90,000 in any calendar year. Allows a candidate participating in a general and in a special election in the same year to accept $90,000 for each election. Specifies that any extension of credit for advertising on broadcasting stations, in newspapers or magazines, by direct mail or other types of public political advertising, shall be considered a contribution, if such credit is; (1) in an amount of more than $1,000; and (2) for a period of more than 30 days. Adds a new title V, Financing of General Election Campaigns for the House of Representatives, to such Act. Entitles candidates for the House of Representatives to campaign payments on a matching basis if they meet certain criteria and agree to comply with specified spending limits and reporting requirements. Requires such candidates to certify that: (1) their authorized committees will not make campaign expenditures in excess of certain limitations; (2) no contributions will be accepted by such candidates or their authorized committees in violation of this Act; (3) such candidates are seeking election to the House of Representatives and have received contributions for that campaign in excess of a certain sum; (4) they will not exceed the limitation on the expenditure of personal funds; and (5) at least two candidates have qualified for election to the same seat. Sets forth formulas for the determination of the amount of money to which a candidate is entitled. Stipulates that sums given by one contributor totalling over $100 and contributions received from anyone other than an individual shall be disregarded for purposes of matching payments. Limits the expenditure of personal funds to $20,000 per election. Sets spending limits for candidates receiving payments under this Act. Waives such limits for candidates: (1) whose opponents have spent sums in excess of the limit imposed for candidates receiving payments: or (2) who have refused to agree to expenditure and contribution limitations. Allows certain additional payments to certain candidates whose opponents use independent funds for communications and broadcasting. Requires the Federal Election Commission to certify the eligibility of candidates to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary to disburse funds to such candidates. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a separate House of Representatives Election Campaign Account in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and to deposit certain sums in such account in accordance with specified guidelines. Requires repayment of excess payments and unexpended payments. Penalizes the use of funds for other than campaign purposes. Authorizes the Federal Election Commission to institute repayment actions in U.S. district courts. Specifies the administrative authority of the Commission in carrying out this Act. Requires the Commission to make certain reports to Congress. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow candidates for Federal office response time on a broadcasting station if their views or qualifications have been criticized in purchased broadcast time on such station."
