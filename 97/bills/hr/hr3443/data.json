    "text": "First-Year Capital Cost Recovery Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide an accelerated method of depreciation for depreciable personal property which is placed in service after December 31, 1980. Assigns such property to one of four classes based on present class lives under the Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system. Allows 92.7 to 98.5 percent depreciation of such property in the current taxable year based upon the class to which it is assigned. Excludes certain types of property from accelerated depreciation treatment. Provides for depreciation of certain real property placed in service after December 31, 1980, according to the straight line method based on a useful life of 20 years. Specifies a 15 year useful life for low-income housing. Permits the expensing (i.e. deducting in current taxable year) of up to $25,000 of depreciable business assets, in lieu of current provisions allowing additional first year depreciation of such assets. Allows a 30 percent variance from class life for long-life public utility property and certain real property. Disqualifies any property depreciated under the terms of this Act from investment tax credit treatment."
