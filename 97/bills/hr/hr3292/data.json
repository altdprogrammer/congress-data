Rept. 97-68) Domestic Volunteer Service Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to authorize appropriations to carry out national volunteer antipoverty programs in such amounts as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984. Requires that at least 83 percent of such funds must be earmarked for the VISTA program. Eliminates provisions earmarking portions of such funds for other programs. Extends through fiscal year 1984 the authorization of appropriations for the administration and coordination of domestic volunteer services. Eliminates provisions relating to a financial assistance limitation for specified special service-learning programs. Authorizes the Director of the ACTION Agency to make grants and contracts for projects and programs which encourage and enable students in secondary, secondary vocational, postsecondary schools to participate in service-learning programs on an in-school or out-of-school basis in specified assignments."
