    "text": "Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1982 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, to establish a two-tier dairy price support program for FY 1983 through 1985. Sets the price of milk for domestic needs: (1) at $13.10 per hundredweight for FY 1983; and (2) at the percentage of parity for FY 1984 and 1985 which $13.10 represented as of October 1, 1982. Sets the price of milk in excess of domestic needs at the higher support level uniformly reduced to cover the annual costs of acquiring, managing, and disposing of surplus milk. Provides that the funds from such reduction shall be remitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) by the first milk handlers, including producers who market their own milk. Limits CCC annual milk purchases to five billion pounds, with producers responsible for costs in excess of such amount. Stipulates that the CCC shall increase its purchases if import quotas are increased. States that the price of milk shall be supported through milk and milk products purchases. Authorizes payments to producers who reduce their production. Establishes a National Dairy Board consisting of the Secretary of Agriculture and 15 presidentially-appointed members. Directs the Board to: (1) determine the relative proportions of milk to which the price support levels will apply and the producer responsibility for dairy product purchases; (2) establish a uniform price support reduction rate for milk in excess of domestic commercial market needs and announce such rate before October 1 of each year; (3) dispose of dairy products acquired by the CCC through authorized price support operations; and (4) remit proceeds from price support operations to the CCC. Sets forth enforcement provisions."
