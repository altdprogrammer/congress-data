    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-03-25", 
    "text": "Nuclear Waste Policy Act - Title I: Findings and Purposes - Declares the purpose of this Act to be to: (1) assume Federal responsibility for the acquisition and interim storage of spent fuel and the disposal of high-level radioactive waste from civilian nuclear activities; (2) establish a Federal policy for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste from civilian nuclear activities; (3) authorize the Secretary of Energy to acquire or construct nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities; and (4) provide for consultation and cooperation between the Federal Government and States and Indian tribes with regard to nuclear waste storage facility and repository siting. Title II: Definitions - Defines the terms used in this Act. Title III: Interim Storage of Spent Fuel From Civilian Nuclear Powerplants - Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts providing that the Federal Government will: (1) take title to spent fuel from civilian nuclear powerplants; (2) transport and store such spent fuel in Federal facilities; and (3) dispose of waste products associated with such spent fuel. Provides for a one-time payment by the owner of such spent fuel in an amount adequate to cover the proportionate costs of such transportation, storage, and disposal. Directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register notice of intent to enter into such contracts and of the one-time payment charged to owners of spent fuel. Directs the Secretary to construct or acquire one or more facilities for interim storage of spent fuel. Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts with private industry for the transportation of spent fuel to such facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to use Federal transportation services if private industry is unable or unwilling to provide such transportation at a reasonable cost. Makes funds available for the establishment of such facilities. Directs the Secretary to inform the Governor and the legislature of any State in which a potential facility site or an existing facility is located of the investigation and selection of such site or facility for interim storage of spent fuel. Requires that the Secretary suspend work on such facility upon receipt of objections by the Governor and transmit such objections with recommendations to the President. Directs the Secretary to terminate such work unless, within 90 days after receipt of the Secretary's transmission, the President determines such facility is essential to the national interest. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to provide that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) shall have licensing and related regulatory authority over storage facilities for spent fuel from foreign reactors transferred under an arrangement authority under such Act. Title IV: Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Waste Resulting from Civilian Nuclear Activities - Directs the Secretary to transmit to Congress within one year from enactment of this Act a proposal for the construction of one or more safe repositories for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste from civilian nuclear activities. Requires the preparation of an environmental assessment on such proposal based on information regarding alternative waste disposal technologies. Makes any facility authorized by Congress subject to the licensing authority of the NRC, but prohibits the NRC from considering any design criteria for such facility other than those required by this Act. Directs the Secretary to make annual impact aid payments to the local governments of areas in Alaska where: (1) such repositories are located and have a substantial impact on the governments; (2) the construction or modification of such repositories is completed after the date of this Act; and (3) in the case of a modification, such modification substantially increases the repository's capacity. Title V: Financial Arrangements - Establishes in the U.S. Treasury a separate account for the operation of the storage and disposal program. Permits the Secretary to borrow from the Treasury such amounts as may be provided in appropriation Acts, but not to exceed $300,000,000. Sets forth the terms and repayments of such loans. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982. Title VI: State Role in Nuclear Waste Repository Siting - States that this title shall not apply to the transportation, management, or disposal of spent fuel or radioactive waste from atomic energy defense activities of the Secretary or Federal research and development activities. Directs the Secretary to establish with each State and Indian tribe affected by repository siting under this Act a cooperative agreement under which the State and Indian tribe shall have the right to participate in a process of consultation and concurrence, based on public health and safety concerns, in all stages of the planning, siting, construction, and operation of a repository. Requires such agreement to provide procedures for resolving objections of the State and Indian tribe at any stage in the repository siting process. Directs the Secretary to inform the Governor, the legislature, and any affected Indian tribe of a State if a repository for the permanent disposal of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste is to be located in such State. Requires that they be notified at least 90 days prior to formal application by the Secretary to the NRC for a construction permit. Requires the Secretary to suspend work on a repository site upon receipt of objections by the Governor or an Indian tribe within such 90-day period and transmit such objections with recommendations to Congress and the President. Directs the President to inform Congress in writing upon a determination that such repository is essential to the national interest and the concerns of the State and the Indian tribe have been addressed sufficiently. Prohibits the Secretary from continuing work on such site unless both Houses of Congress enact an approval resolution."
