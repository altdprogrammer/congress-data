Provides: (1) for an annual increase in such amount based upon the percentage increases in the Consumer Price Index; and (2) that such amount shall be changed in accordance with a State's population increase or decrease. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to each State with an \"excess unemployment percentage\" greater than zero, as determined according to this Act, a supplemental grant based on a specified formula. Permits a State to require any individual whose needs are taken into account in determining AFDC eligiblity to work as a condition of AFDC eligibility. Establishes a five year, ten State demonstration project to provide a pilot test of the States ability to create their own welfare program as an alternative to AFDC. Allows payment made to participating States pursuant to such program to be used without regard to the requirements and limitations otherwise applicable under the AFDC program. Directs the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and to Congress concerning such project."
