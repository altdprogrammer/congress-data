Requires a person, before bringing such an action, to: (1) notify the Attorney General of the suspected violation of an antitrust judgment; and (2) provide the Attorney General a specified period of time to commence an action to enforce the antitrust judgment on behalf of the United States. Awards legal costs to a person who prevails in such an action. Establishes a civil penalty of not to exceed $10,000 for each violation of an antitrust judgment. Allows any party to an antitrust judgment or any person injured by a violation of such a judgment: (1) to petition the Attorney General to obtain a modification of such judgment; and (2) if no action is taken by the Attorney General, to petition the appropriate U.S. district court to modify or vacate such judgment."
