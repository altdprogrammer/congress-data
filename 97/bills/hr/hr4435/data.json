Prohibits any party to a Federal labor-management collective bargaining agreement from terminating or modifying such agreement unless it provides the other party written notice 90 days prior to such action. Requires the party proposing such action to notify the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of any dispute over such action which has not been resolved 45 days after such notice. Directs the Service: (1) to establish a factfinding panel if the parties do not resolve such dispute or adopt procedures for binding arbitration by the date of the proposed revision or termination or by the date the existing agreement expires; and (2) to establish an arbitration board to conduct a full hearing over any dispute not resolved within 90 days after such date. Declares that decisions of the board shall be binding. Requires the parties to share the costs of the board and the panel. Requires the Service to establish: (1) a factfinding panel if an agency and a bargaining unit which are not under a collective bargaining agreement fail to reach an agreement after 90 days of collective bargaining; and (2) an arbitration board to conduct a hearing if such parties fail to reach an agreement after 180 days, unless they have agreed to another form of binding arbitration."
