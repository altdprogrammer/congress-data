Directs the FCC to require that essential telephones provide internal means for effective use with specially designed hearing aids. Defines \"essential telephones\" to mean only coin operated telephones, emergency telephones, and other telephones frequently needed by persons using hearing aids. Directs the FCC to establish the necessary technical standards. Directs the FCC to establish the labeling requirements necessary to provide consumers with adequate information on the compatibility between telephones and hearing aids. Directs the FCC, in rulemaking decisions, to consider the costs and benefits to all telephone users, with and without hearing impairments. Directs the FCC to ensure that regulations adopted to implement this Act do not impair development of improved technology. Requires the rules and regulations required by this Act to be completed within one year after enactment. Directs the FCC to review such rules and regulations periodically. Permits common carriers or connecting carriers to provide specialized terminal equipment needed by persons with hearing, speech, vision, or mobility impairments. Permits such carriers to recover in their tariffs for regulated service the costs for such equipment not charged to users of the equipment."
