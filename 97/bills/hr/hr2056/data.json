    "text": "Amends the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 and the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate a medical specialty certificate from the American Board of Medical Specialties as one of the requirements for an alien graduate of a foreign medical school to be admitted as an immigrant or nonimmigrant exchange visitor. Provides that such an alien's stay shall be the lesser of seven years or the time normally required to complete a designated course of medical study (presently two years with a one year extension). Permits such an alien to change his/her designated course of medical study, upon approval of the Director of the International Communication Agency, once within two years after entry or acquisition of exchange visitor status (presently must continue course of education under which admitted to the United States). Makes such duration of stay and course change provisions applicable to those aliens entering the United States on or after January 10, 1978. Extends the waiver authority regarding such aliens to December 31, 1983. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a case-by-case determination regarding such waiver. Adds the additional requirement before such waiver may be authorized that the medical program concerned have an approved plan to reduce its reliance on alien physicians. Requires that such plan describe: (1) problems anticipated without such waiver and alternative methods to reduce any health services disruption; (2) changes in the program and recruiting efforts to attract U.S. citizens; and (3) how the program, on a yearly basis, has phased down its dependence on such aliens. Directs the Secretary, in coordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to: (1) monitor the issuance of such waivers and programs; and (2) report to the Congress at the start of fiscal years 1982-1984 on the nationality, specialization, and geographic distribution of such aliens receiving waivers. Includes such aliens and their dependents within the definition of \"special immigrant.\" Requires the Secretary, after consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the International Communication Agency, to evaluate the effectiveness of such medical training programs and to report to the Congress by January 15, 1983."
