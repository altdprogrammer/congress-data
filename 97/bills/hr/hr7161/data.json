    "text": "Public Assistance Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1982 - Establishes as a condition of eligibility for Federal payments under public assistance programs the requirements that each State: (1) match its public assistance rolls against all relevant State and Federal records at least once each calendar quarter to verify the income, assets, and status of program participants in determining their eligibility for assistance; (2) remove ineligible individuals and otherwise eliminate fraud and abuse under such programs; and (3) require each State and local official or agency with jurisdiction over relevant State or Federal records to provide such records upon request for matching purposes. Directs each State to compile reports on such matching process for each or several programs and to make such reports available to the agencies with program jurisdiction. Directs Federal agencies and officials to provide relevant records to States upon request. Requires Office of Management and Budget guidelines for matching activities to assure the maximum possible protection of the privacy of individuals involved. Provides that each applicant for, or recipient of, assistance under a public assistance program (including the Medicaid and Aid to Dependent Children programs under the Social Security Act and State unemployment insurance programs) shall be deemed to have consented to the procedures established by this Act. Incorporates the provisions of this Act into any State or Federal law concerned with the administration of a public assistance program."
