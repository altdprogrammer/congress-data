    "text": "Comprehensive AFDC Improvements Act of 1981-Part I - Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act to permit a State to implement a standard or limitation relating to the State's plan which: (1) is more severe or more restrictive upon recipients than is presently provided; or (2) reduces a State's expenditures or the number of eligible individuals. Decreases the amount of income and resources which may be excluded for purposes of determining AFDC eligibility. Eliminates optional State aid for pregnant women. Excludes from the term AFDC any amount paid certain relatives of a dependent child. Eliminates provisions providing for the proration of shelter allowance in certain cases where a child lives with a relative not legally responsible for the child's support. Requires AFDC recipients in addition to registering for the Work Incentive Program (WIN) in order to receive aid to also register with the State employment service. States that an individual may not be excused from registering because of the necessity of providing child care if adequate child care facilities are available. Requires the imposition of a lien on the residence in which any dependent child and relative are living if the residence is owned by the child, relative, or any individual whose needs are taken into account in determining eligibility. States that the lien shall not be enforced unless and until the residence is sold to someone other than the child, relative, or individual."
