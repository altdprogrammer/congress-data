    "text": "Comprehensive Immigration Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit the Attorney General to create a record of lawful admission for, or to defer deportation of, specified aliens present illegally in the United States for at least two years. Establishes a commuter worker program for temporary workers from Mexico and the Western Hemisphere. Sets forth program guidelines. Prohibits present nonimmigrants to change to commuter worker status. Permits adjustment to permanent resident after five years of commuter worker status. Subjects an alien to deportation and criminal penalties for false statements made on an admissions application. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) increase the size and technological capacity of the border patrol; (2) establish a system for issuing machine-readable alien identification cards; and (3) report to the President and the Congress within six months. Authorizes necessary appropriations beginning in fiscal year 1982. Increases the fines for smuggling aliens into the United States. Directs the Secretary of State to consult with Mexico on such commuter worker program and related issues and to report periodically to the Congress. Amends the Social Security Act to require new cards to be counterfeit-resistant and show work status when appropriate. Establishes penalties for their false use or manufacture. Makes it unlawful for an employer to hire illegal immigrants. Provides penalties for such violations. Requires the Attorney General to establish hiring regulations."
