    "text": "Critical Industry Reindustrialization Tax Act of 1982 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the targeted jobs income tax credit to the training of skilled labor in labor-shortage business or industry. Defines \"labor-shortage business or industry\" as any business or industry which either the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Labor has certified as having more available skilled jobs than available skilled workers and trainees. Provides for a credit of 50 percent of first year wages and 30 percent of second year wages paid to skilled labor workers. Makes inapplicable to skilled labor workers the restriction that only $6,000 of first and second year wages paid to new employees be taken into account for purposes of the targeted job credit. Makes permanent the jobs credit for skilled labor employees."
