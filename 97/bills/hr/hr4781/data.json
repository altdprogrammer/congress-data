    "text": "Broadcast Licensing, Renewal, and Deregulation Act of 1981 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to revise the method of determining whether to grant a petition to deny an application for a broadcast license. Requires a preliminary finding by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the petition establishes a prima facie case that actions by the licensee evidence such serious disregard for the Communications Act and the rules of the FCC that a denial of the application is justified. Provides an opportunity for a reply by the licensee and for a rebuttal by the petitioner. Requires the FCC to determine, on the basis of the petition, reply, and rebuttal, whether the petition presents a substantial and material question of fact. Requires the FCC to hold a hearing if it finds that such a question is presented. Requires the FCC to decide whether to grant the application within a specified time. States that the FCC shall grant a renewal application by a radio or television broadcast licensee unless the licensee's actions evidence such serious disregard of the Communications Act and the rules of the FCC that denial of the application is justified. Requires the FCC to act upon a broadcast station licensee's renewal application without considering any other application for the station's facilities. Authorizes holders of permits for construction of broadcast stations and station licensees to elect to transfer their permits or licenses without first obtaining an FCC finding that such a transfer serves the public interest. Requires such permitee or licensee to notify the FCC of such election. Provides for public notice of and hearings on such transfers. Prohibits the FCC from considering, when acting upon such a transfer, whether the public interest is served by such transfer. Repeals specified provisions relating to the application of antitrust laws. Revises the fairness doctrine provisions to prohibit the Communications Act from being interpreted as requiring broadcasters to permit persons wishing to present views on public issues to use the broadcast station facilities upon terms that are different from the terms applied to other persons presenting their views on such issues. Repeals the equal time requirements applicable to candidates for public office. Prohibits the FCC from requiring radio or television station licensees to: (1) provide certain programs; (2) adhere to a particular programing format; (3) ascertain the interests of their service areas; (4) restrict or limit their commercials; and (5) maintain program logs that conform to any particular format, except that any program logs used in the normal conduct of broadcast operations must be retained for two years and made public."
