Requires an annual audit of the Center. Directs the Secretary of Education to ensure that: (1) Center service and training programs are monitored regularly; and (2) Center operation is evaluated annually, with written reports to the President and the Congress submitted by specified deadlines. Authorizes appropriations for Center operation and maintenance, for use in accordance with guidelines or regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Defines \"Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults\" to mean that facility and its affiliated network established pursuant to an agreement approved in 1969 by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and continued pursuant to specified provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Repeals such provisions of such Act. Provides that nothing in this Act shall in any way cause to affect or modify any existing or future agreement between any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality and the Industrial Home for the Blind, Inc., or its successors or assignees, with respect to the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults."
