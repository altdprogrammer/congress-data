Requires that such programs be designed to expand the pool of applicants and participants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Prohibits any Federal agency or court from making a finding of discrimination based soley on the composition of the work force. Conditions the granting of relief under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other Federal laws on a finding by the agency or court that an act of discrimination has been committed by an employer, employment agency, or labor organization. Prohibits any remedy from including quotas or ratios of individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, or goals or timetables to meet such quotas. Prohibits any Federal agency from requiring an employer or other entity to collect data regarding the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of any employees, except as a result of discovery procedures under court order after reasonable grounds have been established that discrimination exists."
