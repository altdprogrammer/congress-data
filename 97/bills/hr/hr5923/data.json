    "text": "Energy Information Administration Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 to authorize the Director of the Office of Energy Information and Analysis to provide the head of a Federal agency from which energy information is sought with a binding assurance that such information will not be disclosed to other Department of Energy offices. Permits an agency head to determine when a binding assurance of nondisclosure must be provided. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to provide that the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration is not required to disclose to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission any energy information obtained under a binding assurance of nondisclosure or gathered for statistical purposes. Makes data to be gathered for statistical purposes available to another Department of Energy office or to another Federal agency only upon receipt of a written request with a demonstration of need and with reasonable and binding assurances by the office or agency that the information will be used solely for statistical purposes. Permits an agency head to disclose in any proceeding confidential energy information gained under the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 if: (1) such agency is a party to the proceeding; (2) disclosure is essential to the agency's effective participation in the proceeding; and (3) the agency head seeks an order protecting against disclosure of such information beyond that necessary to the agency's participation in the proceeding. Amends the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 to remove the requirements that the Federal Energy Administrator promulgate rules requiring reports of energy information by persons engaged in the production, processing, refining, transportation by pipeline, or distribution of energy sources. Repeals the quarterly reporting requirements imposed on the Federal Energy Administrator with respect to energy imports, domestic energy reserves and production, refinery activities, and energy inventories. Authorizes the Federal Energy Administrator to require that persons engaged in crude oil or natural gas production keep and submit reports on energy information. (Currently the Administrator is directed to require such reports.) Repeals the requirement under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 that the Federal Energy Administrator maintain a file on U.S. exports of coal and refined petroleum products. Repeals requirements imposed upon the Energy Information Administration under the Department of Energy Organization Act for financial reports from major energy-producing companies and for annual reports to the Department of Energy. Repeals coal reserve disclosure requirements imposed on persons or governmental entities holding such reserves under the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978. Repeals the middle distillate monitoring program under the Emergency Conservation Act of 1979."
