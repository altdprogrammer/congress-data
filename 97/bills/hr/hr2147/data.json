    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and to ten years' to life imprisonment for a second or subsequent offender (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second or subsequent offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose the additional sentence concurrently with the sentence imposed for the felony. Makes the Federal Youth Corrections Act inapplicable to any conviction, and disallows a defendant from pleading guilty to a lesser charge, under the provisions of this Act."
