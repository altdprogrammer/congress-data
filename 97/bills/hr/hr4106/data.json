    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-07-09", 
    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for a process for State consideration of a proposal to locate a long-term storage or disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, or spent nuclear fuel in such State. Requires the Secretary of Energy to publish notice of a site identification for such a facility in the Federal Register and notify the Governor of the State in which the site is located. Requires such notice to include: (1) an analysis of the anticipated environmental, health, safety, and economic impact of such proposal; (2) a plan for the transport of the high-level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, or spent nuclear fuel to the site; and (3) plans for impact assistance to State or local governments or Indian tribes. Directs the Secretary to establish within 15 days after publication of such a notice a Federal-State Radioactive Waste Management Commission, composed of specified Federal agency representatives, the Governor of the affected State, and individuals designated by the Governor, to examine the proposal for a facility site with the objective of achieving substantial concurrence between the State and the Secretary on such proposal. Provides that if a majority of the Commission does not concur with such proposal, the Governor may, within 18 months from the date of the Commission's appointment, file with the President, the Secretary, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report stating the basis for such nonconcurrence and identifying acceptable alternatives. Permits the State legislature of any affected State to notify the Commission of the legislature's concurrence or nonconcurrence with such proposal. Terminates the Commission at the end of the 18-month period. Prohibits site designation or facility development or construction: (1) during the 18-month period after a Commission has been appointed; or (2) if the Commission does not concur with such proposal, unless Congress passes a concurrent resolution approving the site identification."
