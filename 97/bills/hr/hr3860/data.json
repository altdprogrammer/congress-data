    "text": "Tuition Tax Relief Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable income tax credit for 50 percent of the educational expenses paid for the elementary, secondary, college, or vocational education of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependents. Sets forth maximum dollar amounts allowable as a credit. Excludes from eligibility for the credit educational expenses for: (1) elementary and secondary education at a privately operated institution of a State educational agency, other than an institution which offers education for the handicapped as a substitute to regular education; (2) part-time study; and (3) graduate study. Requires the individual for whom the tuition tax credit is allowed by this Act to be a full-time student or a half-time student during any four months of the calendar year. Excludes from the definition of \"educational expenses\" any amounts paid for books, supplies, and equipment for courses of instruction, meals, lodging, transportation, similar personal expenses, and education below the first-grade level. Forbids any construction of this Act as granting the Government additional authority to examine the books or activities of any church school. Requires that any amount received by the taxpayer as a tuition tax credit be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of the taxpayer for Federal, State, or local educational assistance. Specifies that the granting of a tax credit to a student due to his enrollment in any educational institution shall not be considered Federal assistance to such institution."
