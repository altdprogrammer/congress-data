Provides that, notwithstanding the terms of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 or any contract, any price increase subject to this Act shall not be effective following the expiration of the control period. Defines control period as the period beginning December 1, 1982, and ending May 31, 1983. Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prescribe regulations which assure that the reductions in the costs which (but for this Act) would be borne by natural gas purchasers shall be passed through to such purchasers."
