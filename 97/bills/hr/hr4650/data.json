    "text": "Employment Information Privacy Act - Establishes procedures governing the collection and distribution of employment records by persons engaged in an industry affecting commerce with 15 or more employees, but excluding the Federal and State governments. Requires an employer to provide written notice to an employee before collecting information for an employment report from third parties. Prohibits an employer from requiring or asking an employee to authorize the disclosure of information about him or her unless the authorization meets specified standards. Requires an employer to designate records to which employees have access. Prohibits an employer from denying access to certain types of records, including those relating to employment performance, medical or insurance records, or records obtained from a consumer-reporting agency. Entitles an employee to see and copy information in an investigative employment report maintained by the employer that requested it. Requires an employer to permit correction or amendment of any record. Makes employers civilly liable in Federal district court for willful or negligent noncompliance. Provides that this Act alters State laws only to the extent of inconsistencies."
