Provides for a combined acreage limitation or set-aside and diversion program for such crop. Requires wheat producers to comply with such combined program in order to receive price supports. Bases 1983 through 1985 wheat and feed grain acreage bases upon the 1982 base adjusted to reflect established crop-rotation practices and other factors as the Secretary of Agriculture determines. Requires the Secretary to make retirement and conservation payments to 1983 wheat and feed grain crop producers who participate in the acreage limitation or set-aside program. Sets 1983 corn support levels (upon which feed grain levels are based) at not less than $2.71 per bushel. Provides for a combined acreage limitation or set-aside and diversion program for such crop if the Secretary determines that the 1982 corn crop will exceed a specified number of bushels."
