Permits the Administrator to contract with private facilities for the provision of priority care. Requires the Department of Defense to reimburse the Veterans' Administration for the provision of such care. Directs the Administrator, whenever priority care is authorized, to submit to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs a report of the plan for the allocation of facilities and personnel to provide such care. Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Defense to pursue planning activities and establish procedures and guidelines for the sharing of Veterans' Administration and armed forces facilities."
