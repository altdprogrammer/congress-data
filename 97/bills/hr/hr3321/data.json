States that such grants shall be for a period of one fiscal year. Requires each applicant for such a grant to submit to the Administrator for his approval an estimate of the costs of operation and maintenance of the treatment works during the fiscal year for which such grant is requested. Deems the Administrator's approval of such estimate a contractual obligation of the United States for the payment of its proportional contribution to the costs of the operation and maintenance of such treatment works. Authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 1982 to carry out the provisions of this Act."
