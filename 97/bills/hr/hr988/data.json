    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Defines such offense as using or carrying a firearm to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five to ten years' imprisonment for a first offender (currently one to ten years) and ten years to life imprisonment for a second or subsequent offender (currently two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences."
