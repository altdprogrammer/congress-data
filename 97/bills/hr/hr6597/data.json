    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-06-15", 
    "text": "Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982 - Authorizes each executive agency, military department, and the Library of Congress to establish programs to allow flexible and compressed work schedules for employees. Provides for the administration of such schedules (see all below) in nearly identical fashion as the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1978 which provided for the experimental implementation of such schedules. Requires that such a flexible schedule include: (1) designated hours and days when an employee must be at work; and (2) designated hours during which an employee may elect his or her arrival and departure times to vary his or her daily work schedule or to earn credit hours to reduce his or her workweek or another workday. Permits the agency head to restrict the employees' choice of arrival and departure times, restrict the use of credit hours, or exclude employees from the program upon determining that the program is disrupting agency functions. Authorizes an agency head, at an employee's request, to grant an employee on such a flexible schedule compensatory time off in lieu of payment for overtime hours. States that such an employee shall not be compensated for credit hours except as hours included in the employee's basic work requirement. Disallows premium pay for such an employee for night duty or night differential pay except for applicable hours during which the employee is required to work, with specified exceptions. Entitles such an employee to eight-hours pay for Federal holidays. Permits the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or any agency to use recording clocks in flexible schedule programs. Authorizes the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to use such clocks regardless of participation in such a program. Limits the number of credit hours an employee may carry over from one pay period to the next. Directs an agency not to establish, or to terminate, a flexible or compressed schedule, notwithstanding any collective bargaining agreement, if the agency determines that such schedule reduces agency productivity or public services or increases operation costs. Requires the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve any impasse between an agency and an exclusive representative of agency employees concerning the agency's decision not to establish, or to terminate, a schedule on the basis of that determination. Prohibits the termination of a schedule provided for under a collective bargaining agreement until the date such agreement expires or the date of the Panel's decision. Prohibits any employee from interfering with another employee's rights of participation in a flexible or compressed schedule program. Directs the OPM to: (1) prescribe regulations for administering the flexible and compressed schedule programs; (2) provide assistance to agencies; and (3) review the effects of such programs on Government operations, transportation, energy consumption, public service, employment opportunities, and employee job satisfaction. Directs the Librarian of Congress to exercise such authority with respect to employees of the Library of Congress. Requires the continuation of each existing flexible and compressed schedule established by an agency under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1978. Authorizes each agency to review any such schedule within 90 days after enactment of this Act. Directs an agency to terminate any such schedule if it determines under such review that: (1) such schedule has reduced agency productivity or public service or increased operation costs; and (2) terminating such schedule will not cause an increase in operation costs. Exempts such termination from negotiation, administrative review (except as the President may provide), or judicial review. Allows an agency or the exclusive representative of agency employees, within 90 days after such a schedule is terminated, to initiate collective bargaining pertaining to the establishment of another flexible or compressed schedule. Terminates this Act three years after enactment."
