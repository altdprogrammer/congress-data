Sets forth the manner of making such sales. Requires using the sales proceeds to capitalize the Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund. Amends the Food for Peace Act of 1967 to establish the Fund in the U.S. Treasury. Authorizes the Commodity Credit Corporation to use the Fund to finance: (1) certain export sales of agricultural commodities; (2) export sales of breeding animals; and (3) facilities in importing countries to handle U.S. agricultural exports. Limits the Corporation's use of the Fund to extending credit to develop markets where there is a substantial potential for regular commercial markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. Directs the Secretary to ensure the equitable use of the Fund to finance sales to the greatest feasible number of countries. Adds to the Fund certain payments received by the Corporation. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the Corporation's use of the Fund to carry out export credit sales. Terminates the Fund on October 1, 1985."
