Requires the acquisition of sufficient property outside the monument boundaries to establish administrative, interpretive, scientific, and other facilities for the monument. Withdraws lands and waters within the monument from the operation of the public land laws, the mining laws, the mineral leasing laws, and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Prohibits commercial timber harvest and water resource development within the monument. Requires the Secretary to manage the monument to preserve its natural resources and to prepare a management plan for the monument. Requires the Secretary to provide recreational and interpretive facilities for public use with respect to the monument. Authorizes the Secretary to control times and means of access and use of the monument. Requires the Secretary to review the roadless lands within the monument within ten years after the enactment of this Act as to their suitability for preservation as wilderness and report the findings to the President for recommendation to Congress. Entitles the counties of Cowlitz, Skamania, and Lewis in Washington to payments from the Treasury in lieu of taxes. Authorizes appropriations."
