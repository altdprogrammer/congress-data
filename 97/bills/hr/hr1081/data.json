    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals a nonrefundable income tax credit for expenses paid or incurred to make alterations to their residences to make them more accessible to, and usable by, a handicapped individual who is either the taxpayer, spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer. Limits the amount of such credit, for each such handicapped individual, to the lesser of $1,000 or an amount which, when added to previous year's credits, does not exceed $5,000. Reduces the amount of such credit by one-half of the amount by which the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer exceeds $20,000 ($35,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly). Requires that the handicapped individual live in the principal residence for which the alterations are made for not less than a nine month period during the taxable year."
