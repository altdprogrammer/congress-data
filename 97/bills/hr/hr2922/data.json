    "date": "1981-03-31", 
    "text": "Trade Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to limit certification of eligibility for adjustment assistance to employees at firms for which: (1) there is a substantial probability that a lower level of employment due to increased import competition will be permanent; and (2) increased imports are the substantial cause of such unemployment. Provides for payment of adjustment assistance to begin during any week of unemployment which begins more than 60 days after the petition for certification is filed. Requires that such workers: (1)with respect to the weeks preceding such week of unemployment, have received any applicable waiting period credit and to have exhausted all unemployment insurance benefit rights; and (2) with respect to such week of unemployment, not be entitled to any State or Federal unemployment insurance or waiting period credit. Subjects such workers to specified provisions of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to require certain workers to search for work outside the worker's labor market area or accept certain approved training in new or related job categories. Makes the weekly amount of the trade readjustment allowance equal to the worker's weekly unemployment insurance benefits. Limits the total amount of trade readjustment allowance payments and the length of time during which a worker is entitled to such payments. Authorizes payment of such allowance for an additional 26 weeks so that the worker can complete an approved training course if the worker applies for such training within a specified time. Increases the authorized maximum job search allowance to $600 (currently $500). Increases the relocation allowance for a worker to 90 percent (currently 80 percent) of the worker's reasonable and necessary transportation expenses and a lump sum payment of up to $600 (currently $500). Requires persons who receive adjustment assistance payments to which they are not entitled to repay such amounts. Directs the appropriate State agency or the Secretary to recover any overpayments by taking deductions from trade readjustment allowances or unemployment compensation benefits. Makes ineligible for further payments persons who receive payments because of false statements or representations or nondisclosure of material facts. Requires the Secretary or appropriate agency to provide an individual an opportunity for a hearing before requiring or collecting any repayment. Repeals provisions for the establishment of an adjustment assistance trust fund. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act."
