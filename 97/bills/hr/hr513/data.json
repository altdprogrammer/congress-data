Directs the Secretary to establish an Office of Technology Export to assist the Secretary. Directs the President to issue rules and regulations limiting the export of critical technologies and goods and significant technologies and goods. Prohibits the President from restricting the export of significant technologies or goods which are available from foreign sources. Directs the President to negotiate with foreign countries to eliminate the availability for export of technologies and goods detrimental to U.S. national security. Prohibits the President from modifying the Secretary's classification of technologies and goods and findings as to availability unless: (1) the President submits a national security impact statement to Congress; and (2) neither House of Congress, within 30 days after receipt, adopts a resolution of disapproval. Requires the appropriate Federal agency to submit national security impact statements upon the request of Congress. Provides for the appointment of technical advisory committees by the Secretary of Defense (instead of the Secretary of Commerce)."
