Directs the Administrator and the Secretary to jointly establish guidelines for the sharing of medical resources by health care facilities of the Administration and the Department. Requires such guidelines to include provisions for cooperative sharing agreements with such health care facilities explicitly defining the care to be provided on a reimbursable basis. Directs the Administration and the Secretary to submit an annual joint report to Congress setting forth the guidelines prescribed, the opportunities for interagency sharing agreements, and the progress of interagency activities to share medical resources. Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, upon authorization by the President, to give a higher priority to the furnishing of medical care and services to members of the armed forces on active duty during a period of war or national emergency than to all veterans but those with service-connected disabilities. Permits the Administrator to contract with private facilities for the provision of priority care. Requires the Department of Defense to reimburse the Veterans Administration for the provision of such care. Directs the Administrator to maintain current plans for the provision of hospital care and medical services to members of the armed forces, including provisions to ensure that VA facilities will be ready to accept such members within 48 hours of a declaration of war or national emergency by the President. Requires the Secretary and Administrator to review such plans at least annually and to report to the appropriate congressional committees within 30 days of any modifications. Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Defense to pursue planning activities and establish procedures and guidelines for the sharing of Veterans' Administration and armed forces facilities."
