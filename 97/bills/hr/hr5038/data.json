    "text": "Air Traffic Control Revitalization Act of 1981 - Entitles Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees in specified positions directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the air traffic control system or unusually taxing and critical to safety to an operational responsibility pay differential. Exempts such employees from provisions limiting premium pay for Federal employees. Entitles an air traffic controller for the FAA who is not required to be certified in the control of air traffic to receive an occupational currency pay differential upon attaining, and while holding, such certification. Declares that an air traffic controller shall be eligible to receive premium pay for: (1) time spent providing on-the-job training in the control of live air traffic; and (2) one-half hour of each eight-hour day the controller is required to work without a 30-minute meal break. Entitles retired members of a uniformed service and civil service annuitants who are temporarily employed in an air traffic control function during a period requiring special recruitment efforts to continue to receive full retirement pay or annuities, respectively, in addition to the salary of the air traffic control position. Authorizes the FAA to pay an employee undergoing training as an air traffic controller at the employee's basic pay rate for training hours in excess of 40 hours per week. Declares that an individual who is separated from service as an air traffic controller and who receives a refund of civil service retirement deductions withheld during such service shall not be eligible for an annuity based on such service unless he or she redeposits the amount refunded."
