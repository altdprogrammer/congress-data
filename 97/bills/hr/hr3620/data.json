Excludes property in the area occupied by Federal agencies from such transfer. Requires GSA to recognize that the fair market value of the property is determined by the market in which it shall be sold, with the city of Hoboken being the only potential purchaser. Directs GSA to expedite the sale and transfer of the property. Directs GSA to give consideration to: (1) the right of the Federal Government to compensation; (2) the city's ability to pay; (3) whatever funds and costs the Federal Government has invested in the property; and (4) the fact that the city has been deprived of tax revenues from the property but has been required to provide it with municipal services. Repeals certain Acts which provide restrictions on the Federal Government and the city pursuant to any such sale."
