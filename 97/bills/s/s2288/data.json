    "text": "Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended by the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, to increase loan levels for the 1982-1985 wheat (from $3.55 to $4.20 per bushel) and corn crops (from $2.55 to $2.90 per bushel). Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make authorized economic emergency loans available immediately to farmers and ranchers. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480) to increase the food assistance available for nonprofit and voluntary agency distribution. Declares that Department of Agriculture soil and water conservation programs should emphasize prevention of soil degradation. States that the Secretary shall determine that sufficient soil erosion technical and financial assistance is available nationally before providing such assistance to specially targeted erosion areas."
