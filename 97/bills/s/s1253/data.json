    "text": "Amends the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 to require a judicial officer, in setting conditions of pretrial release for any person charged with certain narcotics offenses, to consider which conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community, the personal safety of persons in the community, and the prevention of similar offenses by such person. Requires a judicial officer to deny release to any person charged with a narcotics offense who: (1) has previously been convicted of a felony narcotics offense under Federal, State, or foreign law; (2) is on parole, probation, or other conditional release for a felony offense under Federal or State law; (3) is an illegal alien; (4) was arrested in possession of a false passport; or (5) has been convicted of being a fugitive from justice. Requires the Government to provide clear and convincing evidence that the person charged falls within any such category and to establish that there is substantial probability that the person committed the offense. Permits the judicial officer to grant release to a person who has not been previously convicted of a felony narcotics offense upon a finding of special mitigating factors. Requires that the case of a person who is denied release be placed on an expedited calendar."
