    "text": "Regulatory Mediation Act of 1981 - Authorizes an agency or any person to request that the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States make a decision on whether to recommend establishment of a regulatory negotiation committee to develop a proposed rule. Sets forth criteria the Chairman should consider in making such decision, including: (1) the agency's willingness to issue such a rule and utilize such a commission; and (2) the number of interests which would be affected by the rule. Directs the Chairman: (1) to report a decision within 60 days; and (2) upon recommending the use of a committee, to recommend: (a) qualified committee members who represent all interests substantially affected; (b) whether a mediator should be used; (c) the issues to be considered; and (d) a work schedule. Leaves the establishment of such committee, if recommended by the Chairman, to the agency's discretion. Requires an agency, before establishing a committee, to publish a notice: (1) describing the issues to considered; (2) identifying committee members; (3) prescribing the work schedule; and (4) inviting public comments. Directs the agency to provide 30 days for comments and to modify the committee where appropriate. Directs each committee to reach a consensus on a proposed rule and to submit a report on the rule to the agency, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and certain congressional committees. Requires an agency to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, including the committee report, for each proposed rule developed by a committee. Permits the agency to propose notifications or amendments to the proposed rule. Exempts committees and members from certain provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and other Federal laws concerning ex parte communications and civil service employment. Authorizes the Chairman to employ persons to serve as non-voting mediatiors of committees. Requires each agency to pay the expenses of its committees. Authorizes appropriations."
