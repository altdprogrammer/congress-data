Prohibits the payment of title II benefits to any dependent or survivor of such an individual on the basis of such individual's wages and self-employment income. Makes such prohibition inapplicable if the benefit involved is payable to such an individual as the dependent or survivor of: (1) a U.S. citizen or national; (2) a permanent resident of the United States; or (3) a U.S. citizen or national residing outside the United States if the relationship required for such individual's entitlement already existed at the time such national or citizen reached age 50. Authorizes the payment of title II benefits to an individual who is not entitled to benefits pursuant to this Act until the total amount of such benefits equals the total amount of any taxes paid on the wages and self-employment income on which the benefits are based."
