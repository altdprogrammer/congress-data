Requires that a specified amount of the sums authorized to the Environmental Protection Agency for FY 1983 be made available to the National Academy of Sciences to conduct the following studies: (1) an assessment of the procedures for estimating the relative risks to human health and welfare and natural resources, of releases, spills and leaks from disposal sites of hazardous wastes; (2) a review of the current knowledge of the effects of hazardous chemical and waste management procedures on ground water systems and supplies; and (3) an assessment of the institutional factors inhibiting the development and siting of facilities for treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. Requires such studies to be completed within 12 months after the completion of contractual arrangements and reports submitted to specified Congressional committees."
