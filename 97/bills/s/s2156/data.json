    "text": "Authorizes the head of an executive agency or military department to establish one or more alternative work schedules if use of such a schedule would improve agency productivity or public service and would not add to the cost of operations. Defines an \"alternative work schedule\" as a schedule providing for a working requirement of other than five eight-hour days and a 40-hour week. Requires an agency to obtain the approval of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) before using a compressed work schedule under which the 80-hour biweekly work requirement is scheduled to be performed in less than ten days. Requires the termination of any alternative schedule that does not fulfill the objectives of this Act. Directs OPM to prescribe regulations governing overtime pay, premium pay, and credit hours under alternative schedules. Limits the number of credit hours an employee may carry over between pay periods. Declares that the authority of an agency official to use or terminate an alternative work schedule shall not be affected by labor-management relations. Requires each agency head to review any alternative schedule established under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedule Act of 1978 and to terminate any schedule that does not fulfill the objectives of this Act."
