    "text": "Reciprocal Trade, Services and Investment Act of 1982 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include foreign restrictions on direct investments by U.S. citizens or nationals among the foreign trade restrictions on U.S. commerce that would trigger a U.S. response. Authorizes the President to take action to establish or further the principles of national treatment or reciprocal market access with respect to U.S. goods, U.S. services, and foreign direct investment by U.S. nationals or citizens. Authorizes the President to: (1) enter into bilateral or multilateral negotiations to further such principles; (2) adjust Government procurement policies to provide for procurement from nations that provide reciprocal market access to comparable U.S. producers; (3) instruct the U.S. directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund to vote against aid to countries that do not adhere generally to principles of national treatment and market access; (4) request Federal regulatory agencies to consider a country's adherence to such principles in making decisions or taking actions with respect to applications or requests of such country; or (5) propose legislation which would impose equivalent restrictions within the United States on goods and services from countries that do not adhere to such principles. Authorizes the President to take any other appropriate action to enforce U.S. trade rights, respond to discriminatory trade practices, or further principles of national treatment or reciprocal market access. Changes the definition of commerce for purposes of U.S. trade agreement enforcement rights. Includes within that definition foreign direct investment by U.S. citizens or nationals. Defines national treatment for such purposes as the treatment by a government of foreign investment or foreign establishments operating within its borders in the same way as a domestic investment or comparable domestic establishments. Authorizes the House Ways and Means Committee or the Senate Finance Committee to file a resolution with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) requesting the President to take action to enforce U.S. trade rights, respond to discriminatory trade practices, or further principles of national treatment or reciprocal market access. Provides that consultations need not take place between the USTR and a foreign country after beginning an investigation into complaints concerning such country's national treatment or market reciprocity policies. (Current law requires such consultations when the United States is investigating complaints about U.S. trade agreement rights or foreign discriminatory trade practices.) Requires the USTR to recommend to the President a course of action within one month of the start of an investigation of complaints concerning national treatment or reciprocity. Directs the President to make recommendations to Congress within 120 days of starting an investigation into complaints concerning national treatment and market reciprocity. Authorizes the President to negotiate international agreements on restrictions on foreign direct investment."
