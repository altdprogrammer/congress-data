    "text": "Veterans' Education and Employment Amendments of 1982 - Title I: Veterans Rehabilitation and Education - Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to use the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans Education Account, a matching fund, to receive and disburse funds for the education assistance program sponsored by each of the military departments. Permits the payment of a subsistence allowance to a veteran pursuing a rehabilitation program while residing in a halfway house or participating in a work-release program. Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to station veterans' benefits counselors at locations other than Veterans Administration offices. Repeals the veterans' representatives program. Reduces from ten years to six years the delimiting period for the use of educational assistance for veterans who are discharged or released from duty after December 31, 1979. Directs the Secretary of Defense to reimburse the Administrator for educational assistance paid out after December 31, 1989. Eliminates the requirement that a vocational school prove 50 percent employment among its graduates to prevent the Administrator's disapproving a veteran's enrollment. Prohibits the Administrator from approving the enrollment of an eligible veteran or person in any sales or sales management course which does not provide specialized training. Prohibits the payment of anything but a books and supplies allowance for non-tuition courses taken by veterans in a penal institution. Lessens the detail required in the Administrator's annual report to Congress on the default of educational loans. Title II: Veterans Employment - Requires that priority in jobs training programs be given to disabled, Vietnam era, and recently separated veterans. Changes the position of State Veterans' Employment Representative to that of State Director for Veterans' Employment. Makes such directors functionally responsible for supervising the participation of veterans in Federal employment and training programs, job listings, discrimination complaints, and other specified duties. Requires that funds used to assist States in administering the disabled veterans' outreach program be monitored by the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment. Permits a waiver of limitation on the percentage of outreach specialists which shall be stationed at local employment service offices in a State. Requires outreach specialists to develop programs with the Veterans Administration vocational rehabilitation staff and others to assure maximum assistance to veterans. Directs the Assistant Secretary to monitor the employment of such specialists. Directs the Secretary of Labor to estimate the funds necessary for the administration of the employment training and reemployment rights programs, including the amounts necessary to fund the disabled veterans' outreach program specialists programs. Requires the Secretary's annual report to include a report on activities under such program. Requires each Federal contractor who must take affirmative action to employ such veterans to make annual reports on the number and characteristics of new hires with the state veterans' employment director. Directs the Secretary, through the Assistant Secretary, to assist in the placement of veterans using existing Federal and State agencies. Repeals the exemplary rehabilitation certificates program. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions and Effective Dates - Requires applications for recovery of payments or overpayments of benefits under laws administered by the Veterans Administration to be made within 180 days rather than within two years."
