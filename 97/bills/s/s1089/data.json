    "text": "Emergency Hardship Assistance Grant Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to a State upon application to be used to provide home energy and emergency assistance to low-income individuals. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1985. Sets forth requirements for grant applications. Prohibits the allocation of funds to a State after the first fiscal year in which such State receives funds under this Act unless the State legislature has allocated the expenditure of such funds after holding public hearings on their use and distribution. Requires that payments to a State for any fiscal year be expended in such fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce a State's allotment under this Act if such State fails to provide energy and emergency assistance to an Indian tribe eligible for such assistance under this Act. Requires the chief executive officer of a State to report on the intended use of grants received under this Act. Authorizes a State to use such amounts as are necessary to pay administrative costs. Prohibits the use of grants under this Act for the purchase or improvement of land or for the purchase, construction, or permanent improvement of any building or facility except under specified circumstances. Requires a State to report to the Secretary on its activities and audit its expenditures under this Act for each fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary to audit a State's expenditures as well. Requires a State to repay to the United States any amounts not expended in accordance with this Act, or authorizes the Secretary to offset such amounts against future grants to such State. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate periodically State expenditures under this Act. Permits a State to choose, for fiscal year 1982 only, between operating programs under the block grant established under this Act and operating programs under the Home Energy Assistance Act of 1980, part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act, or the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Prohibits exclusion from participation in or denial of benefits from any program or activity funded under this Act on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or a handicap. Repeals: (1) the Home Energy Assistance Act of 1980; (2) specified provisions of part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act which authorize an emergency assistance program for needy families with children; and (3) the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which authorizes Community Service Administration programs (but does not repeal title VII of such Act, which authorizes a Community Economic Development program). Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish the official poverty line."
