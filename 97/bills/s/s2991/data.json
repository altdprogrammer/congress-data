    "text": "Child Nutrition Amendments of 1982 - Amends the National School Lunch Act to terminate the summer food service program for children in service institutions. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to terminate the special milk program for children, the nutrition education and training program, and the school breakfast program. Replaces grants-in-aid for the child care food program by establishing a general nutrition assistance program for children. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1987 for the payments of allotments to States under such program. Requires each State, in order to receive an allotment, to submit to the Secretary of Agriculture an intended use report. Sets forth requirements for reports and audits for States in receipt of allotments. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions for purposes of this Act. Eliminates the Department of Defense Overseas Dependents' schools from participation in the school lunch program and the school breakfast program. Sets forth a minimum amount available to each State for administrative expenses. Authorizes the Secretary to make pro rata distribution of payments under the National School Lunch Act if available amounts are insufficient. Allows the Secretary to provide technical assistance in planning and carrying out activities under the National School Lunch Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. Allows provision of such technical assistance under the general nutrition assistance program only at the request of a State."
