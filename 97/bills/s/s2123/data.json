Title II: Amendments to the Gun Control Act of 1968 - Amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to declare that no provision shall be construed to preempt a State law on the same subject matter, unless there is a direct and positive conflict between the laws which cannot be reconciled. Declares that Congress does intend to preempt any local government law which prohibits or regulates the ownership or possession of firearms or ammunition, unless the local law is created by Federal or State law. Makes any local government which enacts a law conflicting with this Act ineligible to receive Federal funds for law enforcement."
