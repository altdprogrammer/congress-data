    "text": "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to prohibit the export of major critical components of any facility for, and information and other assistance relevant to, the enrichment of uranium or other isotopic separation of special nuclear material, nuclear fuel reprocessing, or heavy water production. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit under any agreement of cooperation the reprocessing or the use or retransfer of any plutonium in quantities greater than 500 grams resulting from the reprocessing of any special nuclear material exported by the United States or produced through the use of any nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology exported by the United States, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution declaring that Congress finds that: (1) effective safeguards can be applied; and (2) adequate sanctions against violations of nonproliferation agreements have been established. Declares that the transfer or retransfer outside the United States of certain nuclear materials, facilities, or technologies: (1) may be engaged in only if authorized under an agreement for cooperation; (2) shall be considered exports; and (3) shall require a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Requires that the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards applied to U.S. nuclear exports must provide the United States with a timely warning of any diversion of any nuclear material which a non-nuclear weapon state could transform into a nuclear bomb."
