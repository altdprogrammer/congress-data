Provides that, upon enactment of this Act, the injunction issued in State of California versus Bergland shall no longer be in force. States that RARE II is, for purposes of the initial land management plans required by Federal law for national forest lands, an adequate consideration of the suitability of such lands for wilderness designation, and the wilderness option need not be reviewed prior to revision of the initial plans or to the completion date of the initial planning cycle. Provides that areas reviewed in RARE II and not designated as wilderness by this Act or remaining in further planning need not be protected for wilderness designation pending such revision. Prohibits the conduct of any further roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in California without express Congressional authorization. Requires that the Dillon Creek Further Planning Area be considered for all uses during the preparation of a forest plan for the Klamath National Forest Prohibits activities which may reduce the wilderness potential of such land during such time.
