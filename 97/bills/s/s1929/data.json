Establishes an Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health to coordinate Federal and private activities. Requires the Committee to meet at least four times a year. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress. Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to change existing label warning provisions to require cigarette packages and advertisements to carry specified warnings on a rotating basis. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, or package for sale cigarettes without: (1) disclosing tar, nicotine, and carbon dioxide levels on the package; and (2) providing the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services with a list of the types and quantities of chemical additives."
