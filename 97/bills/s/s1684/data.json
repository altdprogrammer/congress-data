Qualifies for the residential energy credit and the investment tax credit all of the equipment of a system using both geothermal energy and a source not eligible for a credit if geothermal energy provides more than 80 percent of the energy for which the system was designed. Allows such credits for portions of such systems which produce, distribute, or use a source of energy which is at least 50 percent geothermal energy."
