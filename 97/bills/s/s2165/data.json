Lists the food in such lunches and bans the sale of sweets on school premises. Provides that such schools should establish a nutrition council to oversee, and recommend ways to improve, such program. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within one year of enactment of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, to prescribe regulations necessary to administer provisions of this Act. Allows the substitution of foods to accommodate the medical and special dietary needs of individual students."
