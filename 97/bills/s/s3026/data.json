Entitles members of either tribe residing on land designated for the other tribe to their traditional and customary use and occupancy of such land. Prohibits either tribe from enacting any ordinance which restricts such residents from following their customary daily practices, from receiving visitors or visiting off the partitioned area, or from discriminating against members of the other tribe in any way. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to pay annual rent to each tribe for such land used by members of the other tribe. Terminates the Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission 180 days after enactment of this Act and terminates all relocations conducted by such Commission on the day of enactment. Permits any individual living on either side of the partition to elect, within 180 days after enactment, to accept the housing and bonus benefits and relocate."
