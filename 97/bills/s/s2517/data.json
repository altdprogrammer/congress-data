    "text": "Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 1982 - Amends the Clayton Act to include within the definition of \"antitrust laws\" for purposes of such Act the Unfair Competition Act. Amends the Unfair Competition Act to prohibit the importation or sale of articles from a foreign country in the United States at a price below the actual market value, wholesale price or constructed value price of such articles if the sale of such articles would or does: (1) injure U.S. labor or industry; (2) prevent the establishment of an industry in the United States; or (3) restrain or monopolize trade of such articles in the United States. (Currently, such importation or sale is prohibited only if the person importing or selling intends to cause such injury, prevention, restraint, or monopoly.) Increases from $5,000 to $50,000 the maximum fine for violating such prohibition. Authorizes a U.S. district court before which a proceeding on such a violation is pending to: (1) subpoena any parties whether or not they reside within the court's district; and (2) enjoin the importation or distribution in interstate commerce by a defendant of the articles alleged to have been sold or imported in violation of the Unfair Competition Act if the defendant fails to comply with any court order."
