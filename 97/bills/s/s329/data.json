Limits the amount of such credit to less than the excess of $300 over ten percent of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $30,000. Reduces such credit by any amount received by the taxpayer for a qualified home heating energy source under any Federal, State, or local program. Limits eligibility for such credit to one person per household. Allocates portions of the credit to tenants of a building which is heated by a qualified home heating energy source."
