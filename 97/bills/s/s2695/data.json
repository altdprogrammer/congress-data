    "text": "Federal Procurement Improvement Act of 1982 - Requires the head of each executive agency to designate at each purchasing and contracting office an advocate for competition who shall promote competition in the procurement of property and services. Directs each advocate of an office which expended more than $25,000,000 in the preceding fiscal year to: (1) review the purchasing and contracting activities of the office; (2) identify and report to the office head concerning opportunities to achieve price competition in purchases or contracts, solicitations that include unnecessarily detailed specifications or restrictive statements which may reduce competition, and other conditions or actions which unnecessarily restrict competition in procurement; and (3) transmit annual reports on his or her activities to the office head. Directs the head of each executive agency to report to specified congressional committees annually on: (1) the number and total value of purchases of and contracts for property or services awarded during the preceding fiscal year after formal advertising and after negotiations with various numbers and categories of sources and evaluations of proposals on the basis of various factors; (2) its policy with respect to the use of dual source procurement; (3) anticipated dual source procurements during the current fiscal year; (4) actions it intends to take to increase competition for agency contracts on the basis of price and to reduce the number and dollar value of contracts negotiated with only one source; and (5) the activities of its advocate. Directs the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to promulgate relations governing the use of dual source procurement by executive agencies. Defines \"dual source procurement\" as the competitive procurement of identical property or services from each of two or more sources, with the largest share of the procurement given to the source that provides the product or service in the most cost-efficient manner and that has the best performance record."
