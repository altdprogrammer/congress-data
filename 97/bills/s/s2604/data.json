    "text": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, 1983 - Authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research and development, construction of facilities, and research and program management for FY 1983. Permits appropriations for research and development to be used for any items of a capital nature (other than acquisition of land) which may be required at locations other than NASA installations for the performance of research and development contracts, and for grants to nonprofit institutions of higher education, or to nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research, for purchase or construction of additional research facilities. Requires the Administrator to notify the appropriate committees of Congress whenever the cost of a facility exceeds a specified amount. Permits funds appropriated for research and development or for construction of facilities to remain available without fiscal year limitation. Permits the funds for construction of any of specified facilities: (1) in the discretion of the NASA Administrator, to be varied upward ten percent; or (2) following a report by the Administrator to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the circumstances of such action, to be varied upward 25 percent to meet unusual cost variations. Limits the total cost of all construction work to the total of the amounts specified. Permits one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for research and development to be transferred to the \"Construction of facilities\" appropriation. Authorizes the expenditure of such funds, together with an additional $10,000,000, to construct, expand, or modify laboratories and other installations. Requires the Administrator to notify the appropriate committees of Congress of the specific nature, cost, and reasons for such construction 30 days before expending funds. Permits each committee to provide the Administrator with a written waiver of such period. Prohibits the expenditure of appropriations for deleted programs or programs in excess of the amount authorized, unless they have been presented to the appropriate committee for a period of 30 days. Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Administrator the cost of placing the Department payloads into orbit by means of the space shuttle. Sets forth a formula for allocating costs. Expresses the sense of Congress that consideration should be given to the geographical distribution of research funds. Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure that all obligations imposed by the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 are performed during FY 1983, including activities of the U.S. Fire Administration and the U.S. Fire Academy."
