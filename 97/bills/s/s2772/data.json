Permits a State attorney general to institute such an action on behalf of a natural person who was not a direct purchaser. Entitles a defendant in an antitrust action to prove as a partial or complete defense that the plaintiff has passed on to others all or part of the damages claimed. Authorizes the court to award a reasonable attorney's fee to a prevailing defendant in such an action upon finding that the plaintiff has acted in bad faith."
