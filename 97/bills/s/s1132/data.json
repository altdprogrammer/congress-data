Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make allotments to States to design, test, and operate a comprehensive evaluation system which meets certain standards. Permits the Secretary to reserve up to five percent of total allotments appropriated for each fiscal year for such purpose. Extends the authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1982 for protection and advocacy of individual rights, university affiliated facility grants, and State allotments. Reduces the authorization levels for university grants and allotments. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to influence issuance or passage of any Executive order, regulation, or Congressional legislation. Revises the Secretary's authority to make special project grants to require that demonstration projects have substantial impact on improving technical assistance grants and gathering and disseminating information relating to developmental disabilities. Extends the authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for special project grants at a reduced level."
