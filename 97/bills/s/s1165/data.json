    "text": "Low-Income Energy Assistance Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to assist eligible households to meet home energy costs. Defines \"eligible households\" as those households: (1) in which one or more individuals are eligible for (a) aid to families with dependent children under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, (b) supplemental security income under title XVI of such Act, (c) food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, or (d) certain veterans' benefits; and (2) with certain income levels. Specifies circumstances under which a household shall not be eligible for home energy assistance. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1986. Specifies the allotment formulas to be used to determine State allocations under this program. Reserves specified amounts to be apportioned among U.S. territories and possessions and used for energy crisis activities and outreach activities for the elderly and handicapped. Requires the Secretary to approve State plans for assistance which comply with the requirements under this Act. Directs the Secretary to withhold assistance payments to a State if there has been a substantial failure to comply with any provisions in the approved State plan. Imposes criminal penalties on anyone who violates this Act or knowingly provides false information in any report required under this Act. Repeals the Home Energy Assistance Act of 1980."
