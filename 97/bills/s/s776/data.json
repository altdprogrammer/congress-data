    "text": "Immigration and National Security Act of 1981 - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) increase the size of the Border Patrol and improve its technology and equipment; (2) establish an alien identification card system; and (3) report to the President and Congress regarding such matters within one year of enactment of this Act. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to limit annual immigration to 350,000 (presently 270,000). Gives admission priority to immediate family members. Provides that in an emergency the President may, after appropriate consultation with Congress, reallocate available immigrant visas or use visas available for the succeeding fiscal year. Requires the President to report annually to Congress concerning the projected number of admissions (including immediate relatives, refugees, parolees, and immigrants). Requires such report to include a determination by the Secretary of Labor regarding the effect of such admissions on U.S. employment. Revises asylum provisions to: (1) require an applicant to show the qualifying conditions (of persecution) that existed prior to departure from his or her country; (2) define \"entry into the United States\" for an applicant involved in an exclusion or deportation proceeding; and (3) direct the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretaries of State and Health and Human Services, to prepare plans for processing applicants, including establishing reception centers outside the United States. Restricts the exercise of the Attorney General's parole authority to a case-by-case basis. Authorizes the Attorney General to permit certain aliens who entered the United States illegally before January 1, 1978, to remain as immigrants. Prohibits the knowing employment of illegal aliens. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations. Directs the Attorney General: (1) to include such enforcement efforts in his annual report; and (2) in cooperation with the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services develop a phased prevention program whose main elements include affirmation of U.S. citizenship, verification of social security records, and issuance of new social security cards. Directs the Attorney General to prescribe a uniform schedule of immigration-related fees and charges. Authorizes necessary appropriations."
