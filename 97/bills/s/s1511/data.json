Designates a beneficiary developing country as a \"country under the Agreement\" if, instead of committing itself to the GATT, the country agrees to a timetable for eliminating export subsidies and agrees not to: (1) increase the number of product classes receiving subsidies; (2) begin new subsidies; and (3) increase the amount of existing subsidies. Directs the President to review annually a beneficiary developing country's compliance with such agreement. Authorizes revoking a beneficiary developing country's status as a \"country under the Agreement\" and imposing countervailing of duties on that country."
