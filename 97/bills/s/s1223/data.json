    "text": "Equal Access to Justice Amendments Act - Amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to limit awards of attorney's fees and other expenses in certain Federal agency actions and in certain judicial proceedings involving the United States to prevailing parties who: (1) would have suffered a pecuniary loss in excess of $500 (and, in the case of agency actions, such loss was in an individual capacity and not as a member or representative of an organization or group); or (2) were engaged in carrying on a trade or business for profit and (a) the amount in controversy (in agency actions, in excess of $500) was directly related to the conduct of such trade or business, or (b) the adjudication involves a violation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Provides, for purposes of such awards, that: (1) an affidavit of the attorney affirming that such fees were routine and customary accompany an itemized fee statement; and (2) the amount awarded not be disproportionate to the amount in controversy. Revises the definition of a \"party\" under such Act to exclude certain agricultural cooperative associations, tax-exempt organizations, and owners who are not sole owners. Requires that fees and other expenses awarded be paid by the particular agency over which the party prevails (for judicial proceedings, the agency issuing an order). Permits such payments from any sums appropriated to such agency, but prohibits specific appropriations for such purpose."
