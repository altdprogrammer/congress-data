    "date": "1982-09-27", 
    "text": "(Conference report filed in senate, S. Rept. 97-589) Student Financial Assistance Technical Amendments Act of 1982 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to limit the maximum Pell Grant a student may receive for academic year 1983-1984 to $1,800 or 50 percent of the cost of attendance (as defined for academic year 1982-1983). Carries over for academic years 1983-1984 and 1984-1985 the Pell Grant cost of attendance criteria in effect for academic year 1982-1983. Directs the Secretary of Education to approve separate (from the Pell Grant family contribution schedule) systems of need analysis for academic years 1983-1984 and 1984-1985 for the campus-based programs of supplemental education opportunity grants, work-study, and direct loans. Carries over the academic year 1982-1983 Pell Grant family contribution schedule into academic year 1983-1984, with specified modifications to be published within 15 days of enactment of this Act. Provides that the academic year 1984-1985 Pell Grant family contribution schedule shall be the same as for academic year 1983-1984, with specified modifications, unless the Secretary of Education publishes in the Federal Register and submits to the Congress a proposed schedule by April 1, 1983, and a final schedule by May 15, 1983. Provides that such final schedule shall take effect unless either House of the Congress adopts a resolution of disapproval by June 15, 1983. Provides for a new proposed schedule to take effect unless another resolution of disapproval is adopted. Directs the Secretary to publish: (1) changes in amounts allowed as an offset for family size as a consequence of specified modifications of the Pell Grant family contribution schedule for academic year 1984-1985, immediately after publication of the Consumer Price Index for September 1983; and (2) the modified family contribution schedule for academic year 1984-1985, by July 15, 1983, under specified conditions. Makes available up to $30,000,000 in Pell Grant appropriations, under specified Federal law, for the purpose of restoring eligibility for (and the amount of) Pell Grants to individuals adversely affected by a modification, pursuant to specified Federal law, of the family contribution schedule with respect to the treatment of veterans' education benefits. Directs the Secretary to: (1) notify such individuals of such restored eligibility; (2) make appropriate allocation of such reserved sum; and (3) consider only one-third of the amount of an individual's veterans' education benefits as student financial assistance for purposes of determining eligibility and amount of such Pell Grant awards. Replaces the ratable reduction formula for Pell Grant awards with a linear reduction formula under which, when there are insufficient appropriations, awards for those with lesser need would be cut by a larger percentage than awards for those with greater need. Makes such formula effective for academic year 1983-1984 and succeeding academic years. Carries over for the July 1, 1983, through June 30, 1984, period of instruction the guaranteed student loan family contribution schedule for the preceding year, with specified modifications. Extends through FY 1983, 1984, and 1985 the proportional reduction formula for apportionment to states of appropriations for: (1) supplemental educational opportunity grants; (2) college work-study; and (3) national direct student loans. Requires specified disclosures of the cost and terms of student loans to borrowers prior to the start of the repayment period. Extends for two years the waiver of Federal priority over the indebtedness of the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae). Terminates the authority of Sallie Mae to consolidate student loans on August 1, 1983. Directs the National Center for Education Statistics to collect and publish for academic years 1982 through 1985 data on tuition, fees, and room and board charges for institutions included in the Higher Education General Information Survey."
