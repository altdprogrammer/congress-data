Stipulates that in order to qualify for the use of the revised formula a State must establish a minimum benefit level for its AFDC program (part A of title IV of the Act, Aid to Families with Dependent Children). Sets forth a formula for determining the cost-of-living index for any State. Requires the minimum benefits to be at least 75 percent of the official poverty line. Provides for additional payments to a State if the State incurs additional expenditures in meeting the minimum benefit amount. Requires under both Medicaid and AFDC that additional Federal funds be passed through the State to local government."
