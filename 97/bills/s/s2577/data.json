Authorizes appropriations to the EPA Office of Research and Development for FY 1983 and 1984 for program management and support. Sets forth permissible uses of such funds. Provides for congressional oversight of transfers of funds between categories. Requires at least 20 percent of specified funds authorized under this Act for FY 1984 to be obligated and expended for long-term research and development. Directs the Administrator of the EPA to report annually on the performance of such long-term research and development programs to the appropriate congressional committees at the time the President's budget is submitted to the Congress. Directs the Administrator, at least 30 days prior to issuing any general notice of major reduction in force in any fiscal year, to inform the appropriate congressional committees of the reasons for the reduction and its impact on carrying out this Act. Requires that certain amounts of specified funds authorized under this Act for FY 1983 and 1984 be authorized for environmental monitoring activities which are authorized under Federal environmental statutes and which support development of a continuing national environmental monitoring program. Directs the Administrator, in consultation and in cooperation with specified Federal and State officials, to: (1) ensure that the national environmental monitoring program, called for under this Act, is comprehensive and national in scope; (2) develop a national monitoring program for air quality and apply its features, where appropriate, to programs for other media; and (3) prepare a plan for the design and implementation of the national monitoring program, with specified inclusions, to be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and submitted to the appropriate congressional committees one year after enactment of this Act, and thereafter biannually, following plan review and update by program participants, the NAS, and the EPA. Directs the Administrator, on the last day of FY 1984, and of each subsequent fiscal year, to report on the state of, and factors affecting air quality based on data gathered through the monitoring program. Requires that data for such monitoring programs be subjected to validated quality assurance procedures. Requires that appropriations authorized for energy research under this Act for FY 1983 and 1984 be used for environmental research associated with: (1) synthetic fuels production; (2) coal, oil, natural gas, and other fossil fuel extraction, processing, transportation, and combustion; and (3) other energy development activities and related problems posing threats to public health and the environment (including indoor air pollution). Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish and maintain a long-term health and ecological effects research program on energy-related pollutants; (2) coordinate such program with related Federal research programs; (3) establish and maintain an energy-related pollutants monitoring program; and (4) include in the air quality report a report on the emission and dispersion of energy-related air pollutants based on data from such monitoring program. Directs the Administrator to continue to conduct development and demonstration of energy-related pollution control technologies as required by pertinent pollution control statutes. Prohibits: (1) administrative transfer of energy-related environmental research projects authorized to be administered by the EPA under this Act to any other Federal or State agency; or (2) the reduction of such programs through budget amendment. Directs the Administrator to carry out a research program with respect to indoor air quality. Requires that such program be designed to: (1) gather data and information on all aspects of indoor air quality in order to contribute to the understanding of health problems associated with the existence of air pollutants in the indoor environment; and (2) coordinate Federal, State, local and private research, development, and demonstration efforts relating to the improvement of indoor air quality. Authorizes the Administrator to establish committees of representatives of appropriate Federal agencies, and advisory groups of representatives of the scientific community, industry, and public interest organizations, as may be necessary to assist in carrying out such indoor air quality research program. Directs the Administrator to consult and coordinate with State and local officials and other interested parties having concerns related to such program. Requires the indoor air quality research program to include research concerning: (1) monitoring of pollution sources and levels; (2) effects of indoor air pollution on human health; (3) control technologies; and (4) information dissemination to assure public availability of research findings. Directs the Administrator to submit to the Congress: (1) an indoor air quality research implementation plan within one year after enactment of this Act; (2) a progress report within 36 months of such enactment; and (3) a final report within 54 months of such enactment.

Reserves specified amounts to carry out such program from funds appropriated pursuant to authorization under this Act for FY 1983 and 1984. Directs the Administrator to develop a Senior Environmental Assistance Program to aid Federal, State, and local environmental agencies in carrying out programs under this Act. Requires, to the fullest extent possible, the utilization of existing older American programs in providing such assistance. Permits a specified amount of the funds appropriated from the Hazardous Substances Response Trust Fund for FY 1983 and 1984 to be expended for research and development activities. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the costs of those research and development activities associated with or necessitated by the actual or threatened release of hazardous substances be paid for out of the fund created by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1970. Amends the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to revise provisions relating to the membership of the Science Advisory Board. Requires that the Board be composed of members appointed by the Administrator from a list recommended by a nominating committee. Requires that the nominating committee's representation include the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, National Cancer Institute, National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences, and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). Directs the NIEHS, in consultation with the Administrator, to establish, chair, and manage the nominating committee. Directs the nominating committee to solicit candidates for nomination to the Board from the general public through notice in the Federal Register. Authorizes the Administrator to obtain necessary information from nominees.
