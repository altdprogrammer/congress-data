    "text": "State and Local Energy Block Grant Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide financial assistance (block grants) to the States for energy conservation and weatherization assistance programs. Sets forth the allocation formula for annual financial assistance to the States and U.S. territories and possessions. Requires a State receiving financial assistance under this Act to provide matching funds from non-Federal sources. Sets forth the type of energy conservation and supply activities for which the grant money received by a State may be used. Limits the amount of funds which may be used for administrative expenses. Requires a State to obligate any funds received under this Act by the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which those funds were appropriated. Requires recipients of financial assistance under this Act and persons responsible for the administration of projects receiving funds under this Act to provide the Secretary with information on the disposition of such funds and to provide access to records and other information for audit purposes. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984. Repeals provisions relating to energy conservation and weatherization assistance in the Energy Security Act, the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, the Energy Research and Development Administration Appropriation Authorization Act of 1977, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the Energy Conservation and Production Act, and the National Housing Act of 1949."
