    "text": "Noninstitutional Acute and Long-Term Care Services for the Elderly and Disabled Act - Amends the Social Security Act by adding a new title, title XXI (Noninstitutional Acute and Long-Term Care Services for the Elderly and the Disabled), to provide a comprehensive system of noninstitutional health, developmental, and social services for individuals with chronic disabilities. Entitles an eligible individual to the following benefits: (1) home health services; (2) homemaker-home health aide services; (3) adult day services; (4) respite care services for up to 14 days, or 336 hours, in any year; (5) service coordination; (6) home help services; and (7) other services, provided on a demonstration basis, which the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines may be of value. Sets forth definitions of such benefits. Provides benefits to every individual who: (1) has attained age 65; (2) is disabled and eligible for benefits under titles II (Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance), XVI (Supplemental Security Income), XVIII (Medicare), and XIX (Medicaid) of the Act; (3) was eligible for such benefits and ceased to be so eligible, but only if loss of benefits would seriously jeopardize such individual's ability to continue to live in a noninstitutional community residence and such individual's income is not sufficient to allow such individual to provide a reasonable equivalent of the services available under this Act; or (4) has been certified as eligible by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. States that no eligible individual shall be eligible to receive any benefits under title XXI or any long-term care benefits under titles XVIII, XIX, or XX (Grants to States for Services) of the Act unless such individual has a plan of care, as specified in this Act, and has been screened and assessed by a preadmission assessment and screening team (PAT) in order to determine the types and frequency of services required by such individual and in order to assure the maximum level of independence for such individual. Requires the Governor of each State to designate the State agency or agencies which shall administer or supervise the administration of the State's PAT program. Directs such agency or agencies to designate entities responsible for establishing area PATs. Directs the Secretary to determine the composition of the PAT. Directs the Secretary to reimburse any PAT, and any State, for the reasonable costs incurred under this Act. Requires beneficiaries under title XXI to make copayments. Sets limits based on income for such copayments. Exempts those below the poverty line from copayments. Directs the Secretary to pay amounts for benefits incurred by an eligible individual in accordance with specified guidelines. Creates the Federal Long-Term Care Trust Fund into which specified funds will be deposited in order to make the payments required by this Act. Coordinates the provisions of this Act with titles XVIII, XIX, and XX of the Act by providing that no payment shall be made under such titles to or on behalf of an individual who is eligible under title XXI for services available under title XXI, unless the individual seeking coverage first undergoes a preadmission screening and assessment as provided in title XXI. States that this Act shall be effective between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 1987. Directs the Secretary to monitor the effects of this Act and report to the Congress. Directs the Comptroller General to also conduct an ongoing evaluation of the effects of this Act and to report to the Congress."
