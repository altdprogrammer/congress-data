    "text": "Senior Cryptologic Executive Service Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to: (1) establish within the National Security Agency a Senior Cryptologic Executive Service (SCES) comparable to the Senior Executive Service (SES) established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978; and (2) promulgate regulations governing the SCES which conform to the regulations governing the SES with respect to the establishment of positions, compensation, performance appraisal, removal and suspension, performance awards, sabbatical and annual leave, rank awards, entitlement to an annuity after involuntary separation from the SCES, annuity reduction for such an early retirement, and veterans' preference applicability. Authorizes the Director of the Agency to appoint individuals to SCES positions without regard to civil service laws. Permits the Director to detail or assign SCES members to non-SCES positions when it would benefit the Agency or another Government agency. Requires the Agency to submit to specified Congressional committees (with the budget submitted by the President during each odd-numbered year) a report including: (1) the percentage of SCES members employed at each pay rate at the end of the preceding fiscal year; (2) the number and amount of performance awards paid during such year; and (3) the number of SCES members removed for less than fully successful performance. Authorizes the Director to establish a merit pay system for Agency employees which is consistent with the merit pay system established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978."
