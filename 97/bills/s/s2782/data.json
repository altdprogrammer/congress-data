Conditions such release upon the State's agreement not to sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of such land: (1) except to a certain cemetery, exclusively for its expansion; and (2) unless the proceeds from such disposal are held in an account open to inspection by the Secretary and used for public purposes."
