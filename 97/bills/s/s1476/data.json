    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-07-14", 
    "text": "Petroleum Disruption Management Act of 1981 - Title I: Sequential Management Authority and Activation - Directs the President to prescribe (and transmit to Congress for approval) four petroleum disruption management programs: (1) a Strategic Petroleum Reserve distribution program; (2) a private dedicated reserve program (PDR); (3) a national crude oil sharing program; and (4) a petroleum product disruption management program. Prohibits approval of a program unless each House of Congress, within 30 days of transmittal of a program, passes a resolution approving the program. Requires the President to submit a revised program if any program is not approved. Provides for the activation of a program whenever the President determines that a substantial or severe crude oil or energy supply disruption or interruption exists or is imminent, or a program is necessary in order to comply with the international energy program, and an approving joint resolution is passed within six days of transmittal. Limits such programs to 120 days duration. Permits the President to request successive 120-day extensions. Title II: Private Crude Oil and Petroleum Product Storage Incentives - Directs the President to report on the advisability and alternative means of: (1) reducing the tax liability of persons who draw down crude oil and petroleum product reserves during oil supply disruptions; and (2) providing tax or other incentives for the construction of private-sector oil and petroleum product storage facilities and the maintenance of increased private-sector crude oil or petroleum product reserves. Title III: Strategic Petroleum Reserve and Private Dedicated Reserve Distribution - Authorizes the President to distribute crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, upon a determination that a substantial crude oil disruption exists, in amounts not in excess of 300,000 barrels daily for no more than 90 days annually. Provides for such distributions on a pro rata basis. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan from becoming effective unless each House of Congress passes a resolution approving the Plan within 30 days of the Plan's transmittal to Congress. Requires that during a substantial crude oil disruption allocation shall be as provided for in this Act. Requires the Secretary of Energy to submit to Congress a report evaluating the expansion of the physical capacity of the Reserve through the use of temporary storage facilities. Directs the President to promulgate a rule establishing a PDR. Requires the rule establishing the PDR to: (1) provide for the equitable distribution of crude oil at competitive prices; (2) require designated refiners to provide crude oil to any qualified refiner experiencing a supply disruption; (3) distribute crude oil to such qualified refiners to permit them to operate at 95 percent of the national utilization rate; (4) provide that the obligation of each designated refiner to sell crude oil to qualified refiners shall be a given percentage of each designated refiner's average crude oil runs to distallation units during the previous 12 months; and (5) provide that the price paid by a qualified refiner will not exceed a stated level. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a report determining the minimum volume of reserves to be maintained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and analyzing the advisability of distributing crude oil from the Reserve in lieu of activating the PDR. Title IV: National Crude Oil Sharing Program - Directs the President to promulgate a rule establishing a national crude oil sharing program. Requires the rule establishing such program to: (1) provide for the equitable sharing of crude oil at competitive prices among all regions during a severe disruption; (2) require refiners to offer for sale any crude oil supplies that would permit their refineries to operate in excess of the national utilization rate; (3) assure that refiners are able to purchase sufficient crude oil to permit operation at the national utilization rate; (4) provide that the price paid by a refiner will not exceed the weight-averaged price during the previous 60-day period; (5) provide for directives requiring a refiner to adjust the percentage yield of a refined petroleum product in order to increase output of that product in a time of short supply; and (6) provide for the adjustment of the quantities of crude oil allocated among refiners so as to ensure desired production levels. Title V: Petroleum Product Programs - Directs the President to promulgate a standby regulation which when implemented will provide for the mandatory allocation of refined petroleum products produced in or imported into the country in amounts specified in and at ceiling prices specified in such regulation. Requires the standby regulation to provide for: (1) protection of public health, safety, and welfare (including maintenance of residential heating), and national defense; (2) maintenance of all public services; (3) maintenance of agricultural operations; (4) preservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry; (5) equitable distribution of refined petroleum products at equitable prices; (6) allocation of refined petroleum products necessary to explore for and extract fuels and minerals; (7) economic efficiency; and (8) minimization of economic distortion. Requires the standby regulation, in specifying prices, to provide for a dollar-for-dollar pass through of net increases in the cost of crude oil and refined petroleum products at all levels of distribution from the producer to the retail level. Requires such regulation to provide for the establishment of a State set-aside program for refined petroleum products to be activated on a State-by-State basis. Provides that authority to carry out any rationing contingency plan under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act shall expire when this Act becomes effective. Title VI: Establishment of Advisory, Data Collection and Coordination Functions - Directs the President to establish: (1) an Energy Emergency Council, to be composed of members of the executive branch, to advise the President on matters relevant to the implementation of this Act and the activation and management of its programs; and (2) an Energy Advisory Committee, to consist of members of the petroleum industry and consumers, to advise the President and the Council on matters relevant to the implementation of this Act and the activation and management of its programs. Directs the Council, after consultation with the Committee, to evaluate the current energy information collection and monitoring systems within the Federal Government. Directs the Secretary to inform the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration whether the energy information now being collected is sufficient, whether changes are needed, and if so, to direct the Administrator to make the necessary changes. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a report examining the standards for activation of the programs. Title VII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Sets forth provisions relating to administration and enforcement, including: (1) application of provisions of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 to regulations, orders, and Presidential actions undertaken pursuant to this Act; and (2) setting forth monetary penalties for violations of this Act. Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to include any rule, regulation, or order issued under this Act in adjustment provisions to prevent special hardship or inequity. Extends, until October 1, 1989, the authority for international voluntary agreements with respect to the International Energy Program under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Terminates this Act on October 1, 1989."
