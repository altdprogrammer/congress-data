Limits the applicability of such title to those educational programs or activities which themselves receive Federal financial assistance which a Federal agency is expressly authorized by statute to extend by grant, loan, or contract (other than a contract of insurance or guaranty). Makes such title inapplicable to any educational program or activity on the basis that a student receives Federal financial aid, regardless of whether such aid is received through the institution. Applies the discrimination prohibition to any institution which has substantial responsibility for administering a Federal student aid program and has discretion to determine the receipt of assistance. Applies such title to admissions to institutions conducting federally assisted programs or activities."
