    "text": "Title I: Release of Restrictions on Albuquerque Land Transfer - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to release patent restrictions on certain land conveyed to the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, which require that the land be used for approved public purposes, and which prohibit transfer of title or control. Conditions such release upon an exchange of the land for other lands in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. Requires the city to use the Bernalillo County lands for public purposes and retain their title and control. Reserves mineral interests in such lands to the United States. Title II: National Forest Land Transfer - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to sell, exchange, or interchange certain National Forest System lands which are: (1) 40 acres or less and interspersed with or adjacent to mineral patents; (2) ten acres or less and have been used or improved upon as a result of an erroneous Federal survey; and (3) road rights-of-way substantially surrounded by lands not owned by the United States. Requires the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out the provisions of this title. States that nothing in this title authorizes conveyance of Federal lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails System, or National Monuments. States that nothing in this title authorizes the sale of Federal lands within National Recreation Areas. Includes lands proposed for exchange by State, county, or municipal governments among those whose exchange may be facilitated by the Secretary of Agriculture."
