Revises criteria for assistance so that eligibility will be based upon population growth. Makes assistance available to affected Indian tribes. Limits a planning grant to 75 percent of planning costs. Sets a ceiling on the total amount available for planning grants. Prohibits the denial or delay of any license related to major energy development based on an area's failure to be designated as an impacted area. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to designate an organizational unit to provide information and advise communities affected by major energy development activities. Directs the President to establish an interagency council to coordinate all Federal programs which may provide assistance to meet needs resulting from major energy development activities. Title II: Amendments to the Energy Security Act - Amends the Energy Security Act to require the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, when reviewing applications for financial assistance, to consider the potential socioeconomic impact on communities of the proposed synthetic fuel project. Authorizes the Corporation to guarantee loans issued by local governments solely to provide funds for public facilities and services designed to prevent or mitigate adverse social and economic impact caused by synthetic fuel projects receiving financial assistance from the Corporation. Title III: Amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act - Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to permit the prepayment of rentals and royalties. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to require prepayment if operations under the lease are likely to cause substantial adverse social and economic effects."
