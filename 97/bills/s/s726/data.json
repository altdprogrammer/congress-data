    "text": "Children and Youth Camp Safety Act - Establishes in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services an Office of Youth Camp Safety to be headed by a Director of Youth Camp Safety. Confers upon the Director the primary responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of youth camp safety regulations. Provides for Congressional disapproval of such proposed regulations. Requires any State which desires to assume responsibility for the development and modification of youth camp safety standards to submit a State plan to the Director for his approval. Requires approval of a States' plan upon inclusion of specified provisions. Allows a State whose plan has been rejected to obtain review of the decision in the United States court of appeals. Authorizes the Director to make grants to States for up to 80 percent of the costs of developing youth camp safety plans. Authorizes the Director to enter and inspect youth camps and their records. Charges the Director with: (1) establishing within the Department of Health and Human Services an Advisory Council on Youth Camp Safety; and (2) reporting to the Congress and the President at least once in each fiscal year. Establishes judicial procedures to restrain any condition or practice which poses an imminent danger of serious injury at such camps. Prescribes penalties for violations by youth camp operators of the standards promulgated pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1981 through 1985."
