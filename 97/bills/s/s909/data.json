Revises the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony to delete the current requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence or impose concurrent sentences. Eliminates the current prohibition against granting probation to second offenders."
