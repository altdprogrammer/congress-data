Declares that it is the intention of Congress that all the property within the park be acquired by December 31, 1985. Declares that any land or interest therein owned by the State of California or any local government may be acquired only by donation or exchange. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey any property acquired pursuant to this Act to the State of California or any local government, subject to such terms, conditions, and reversionary provisions as will assure preservation of the property for public park or open-space purposes. Conditions the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands and interests upon the occurrence of certain events within specified time periods. Directs the Secretary to convey and transfer such rights-of-way through the park as may be necessary for the establishment of the San Joaquin Hills transportation corridor. Authorizes appropriations."
