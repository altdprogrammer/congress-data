    "text": "Health Services Block Grant Act of 1981 - Amends title III (General Powers and Duties of the Public Health Service) of the Public Health Service Act to replace the current Primary Health Centers grants with a Health Services Block Grant program. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1985. Sets forth the allotment formula and application requirements. Authorizes the use of such funds for health services and related activities (including technical assistance) for migratory and seasonal workers, medically underserved populations, coal miners, individuals at home, medical emergencies, mental health, and alcohol and drug abuse. States that such funds do not have to be used to provide services in the same manner as provided prior to October 1, 1981. Prohibits the use of funds for: (1) inpatient services (other than those prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services); (2) cash payments to health services recipients; (3) construction or land purchase; or (4) satisfying non-Federal funding requirements. Authorizes any State to transfer up to five percent of block grant funds for use under other Federal law providing for health promotion and disease prevention or social services, or for meeting home energy and emergency assistance needs. Requires States to report and to prepare an audit at least every two years concerning activities under this Act. Permits States for fiscal year 1982 to choose between operating programs under the block grant established by this Act or operating programs under the provisions repealed by this Act. Repeals various Federal laws authorizing categorical grants and other assistance in related fields."
