    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 97-294) National Oil Shale Leasing Act of 1981 -Amends the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to revise the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to lease lands containing oil shale deposits. Permits such leases to exceed 5120 acres if a larger area is needed for long-term commercial operations. Limits the larger area to 15,360 acres. Limits the acreage allowed for any Colorado lease to 5120 acres. Sets the term of an oil shale lease at 20 years and afterwards for as long as oil shale is produced in commercial quantities. Directs the Secretary to establish diligence requirements which require that a mining plan be submitted within three years of obtaining a lease. Requires the plan to show that production in commercial quantities will be achieved. Requires the plan to be approved by the Secretary within a specified time. Sets the minimum rental rate at 50 cents an acre. Repeals a provision which permits the waiver of rent during the first five years of a lease. Permits prepayment of a State's share of the annual rental. Increases the number of such leases which may be held from one to one in any single State and three nationwide. Permits the acquisition of two leases in any single State if a lessee has recovered 30 percent of the recoverable shale oil reserve from the first lease. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) permit the mining of minerals other than oil shales on lands covered by an oil shale lease; (2) lease additional lands (referred to as an offsite lease) for the disposal of oil shale wastes; and (3) issue an offsite lease only after considering the environmental impacts and making a determination that the public interest will be served. Prohibits an offsite lease from including mineral rights. Requires a plaintiff seeking judicial review of the Secretary's decision to issue a lease to file a complaint within 90 days of the Secretary's decision. Requires the Secretary before issuing a lease to: (1) consult with the appropriate Governors, and State, local, and Indian tribe officials; (2) consider the need for the lease, the environmental impact of the lease, socioeconomic factors, and information from affected States; (3) seek the recommendations of the appropriate State Governors; and (4) inform a Governor of the reasons for accepting or rejecting a recommendation."
