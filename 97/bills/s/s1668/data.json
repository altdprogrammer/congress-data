    "text": "Fishery Conservation and Management Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 to declare that certain fishery conservation and management guidelines established by the Secretary of Commerce shall not require mandatory compliance. Expands the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council to include the Northern Mariana Islands. Authorizes such regional councils to make recommendations concerning activities by persons or governmental agencies that affect fishery resources under their jurisdiction. Exempts such councils from the Federal Advisory Committee Act and directs them to adopt certain procedures in order to assure public participation in their activities. Allows fishery management plans prepared by any council or the Secretary to state factors that have impeded full utilization of the optimum yield by U.S. fishing vessels. Requires, instead of permits, each council to propose regulations that it deems necessary to carry out any fishery management plan. Revises procedures by which the Secretary shall review and act upon fishery management plans. Permits the establishment of fees at levels exceeding administrative costs for specified fishing vessels. Repeals provisions concerning hearings on and implementation of fishery management plans. Revises emergency action provisions to empower a council to request the Secretary to promulgate emergency regulations to implement fishery management plans. Declares that a council and its constituent States, if acting concurrently and in unanimous agreement, may develop fishery management plans for fisheries within and beyond State boundaries. Revises specified reporting requirements concerning compliance and enforcement."
