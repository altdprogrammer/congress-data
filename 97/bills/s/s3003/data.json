Authorizes the President, upon finding that a labor dispute involving such an organized professional team sport interferes with the normal flow of commerce, to direct each party involved in such dispute to submit a final offer to the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Permits the parties, if no agreement is reached on such offers, to select a panel to act as final offer arbitrator. Directs the President to appoint such panel if the parties cannot agree on its composition. Sets forth mediation and arbitration procedures and deadlines limiting the period for resolution of the dispute to 30 days after the President's order. Provides for modifications and judicial review of the final offer selected by the panel. Directs the President, within five days of enactment of this Act, to direct the parties to the current dispute between the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association to submit final offers in accordance with this Act."
