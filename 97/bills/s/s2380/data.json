    "text": "Veterans' Rehabilitation and Education Adjustment Act of 1982 - Title I: Rehabilitation Amendments - Eliminates variations based upon the number of dependents in the amount of subsistence allowance paid to a veteran participating in a rehabilitation program. Permits the payment of a subsistence allowance to veterans pursuing a rehabilitation program while residing in a halfway house or participating in a work-release program. Title II: Educational Assistance Program Adjustments - Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to establish veterans benefits counselors at locations such as school campuses. Includes within the term \"program of education\" any course pursued by a veteran because it is required as a condition to obtaining financial assistance under the Small Business Act. Eliminates the restrictions on enrollment in certain courses for both veterans and eligible dependents. Disapproves any sales or sales management course which does not provide specialized training within a specific vocational field. Limits the educational assistance allowance for a veteran pursuing an independent study program to no more than the less than half-time rate. Prohibits the payment of benefits, other than cost of supplies, for courses given without charge. Permits the payment of educational assistance to veterans pursuing a program of education or training while incarcerated in prison. Permits the Administrator to discontinue assistance to eligible veterans or dependents enrolled in a program or at an institution which fails to meet specified requirements. Eliminates from the Administrator's annual report to Congress the currently required comparison of the collective and individual default experience. Title III: Repeal of Authority to Pursue Correspondence Training - Repeals the veteran's entitlement to assistance for correspondence or flight school training. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions and Effective Dates - Reduces from two years to 180 days the period within which recovery for payment or overpayment of VA benefits must be sought."
