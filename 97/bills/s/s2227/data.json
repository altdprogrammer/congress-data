Reduces that portion of the total allocation of military sales credits and loan guarantees to Israel which must be available only as military sales credits in FY 1983. Eliminates the allocation of foreign military loan guarantees for Greece for FY 1983. Repeals the provisions allocating a specified amount of FY 1983 foreign military sales credits for Egypt and the Sudan. Increases the amount of such credits that Egypt is released from repaying. Decreases the amount of such credits that Israel is released from repaying. Amends certain definitions to provide that administrative surcharges include recovery of extraordinary expenses incurred by Federal agencies in carrying out foreign military sales. Authorizes the President to provide free training of foreign military personnel at professional U.S. military schools (other than the Service academies) in accordance with reciprocal programs between U.S. and foreign schools.

Exempts the international narcotics program and the international military eduation and training program from the requirement that Congress receive prior notification of reprogramming of funds, if the reprogramming involves less than $50,000. Limits the meaning of the phrase \"communist countries\" for purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to a specified list of countries. (Current law indicates that the phrase includes but is not limited to the countries on such list.) Deletes from the list Tibet and the People's Republic of China. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to declare that the People's Republic of China shall be considered a friendly country eligible to enter into sales agreements and to receive assistance under such Act. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase FY 1982 and 1983 authorized appropriations for peacekeeping operations.
