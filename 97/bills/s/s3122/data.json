    "text": "Tax Funded Advocacy Act of 1982 - Prohibits: (1) the disbursement of Federal funds to any person who engages in advocacy or who is allied with any nonprofit corporation which engages in advocacy; and (2) the use of Federal funds for lobbying or advocacy. Defines \"advocacy\" as any activity intended to influence public policy formation or to advance particular viewpoints with Congress or any legislative body, administrative office or individual, litigation, or the general public. Conditions eligibility for Federal funds on the certification by recipients that they do not and will not engage in advocacy. Makes it the responsibility of anyone disbursing Federal funds to establish that all applicants do not and will not engage in advocacy. Grants the United States a civil cause of action against persons who spend or receive money in violation of this Act. Entitles the Government to recover three times the amount so spent or received. Sets forth penalties for officers or employees of Federal agencies, Government corporations, or nonprofit corporations who violate this Act. Entitles any interested person to sue any violator of this Act and recover: (1) actual damages, but not less than specified liquidated damages; (2) equitable relief; (3) an order barring a recipient from receiving Federal funds; (4) legal expenses; (5) punitive damages; and (6) in the case of a person suing on behalf of the Government, ten percent of all moneys recovered for the Government. Requires self certification by recipients as to noninvolvement in advocacy prior to any renewal or extension of noninvolvement in advocacy prior to any renewal or extension of funding. Establishes intentional misrepresentation as a felony offense. Prescribes a penalty for failure by a person to comply with an order of the Department of Justice to appear and testify as a witness or to provide information in a proceeding arising under this Act. Directs Federal agencies which disburse funds to require that: (1) recipients certify that they will not engage in advocacy; (2) agency officers establish procedures necessary to guarantee that no recipient is engaged in advocacy; (3) recipients submit compliance reports; and (4) fund applications contain information necessary to insure compliance with this Act. Directs such agencies to conduct audits to insure compliance with this Act. Declares that any violation of this Act shall be the basis for total exclusion of Federal benefits."
