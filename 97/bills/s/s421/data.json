Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to allocate the reductions among the instrumentalities of the executive branch in such a way that the total amount that may be obligated by any one agency in any such area shall not be reduced by more than 15 percent. Requires the Director to effect savings of $1,750,000,000 in fiscal year 1982 by improving Federal methods of collecting agency debts most recently considered to be uncollectible. Requires the Director to report to Congress on such allocations and savings."
