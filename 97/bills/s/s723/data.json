Declares it to be the sense of the Congress that such goals should be achieved as soon as feasible through treaties or other appropriated international agreements and diplomatic actions. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to determine the percentage of air pollutants in border areas resulting from foreign sources and to eliminate such percentage in determining compliance with ambient air quality standards by such region."
