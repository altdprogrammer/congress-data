    "text": "Nuclear Waste Management Reorganization Act of 1981 - Title I: Findings, Purposes, and Definitions - States the findings of Congress that Federal nuclear waste disposal programs have been ineffective. Title II: Establishment, Membership, and Functions of Nuclear Waste Management Planning Council - Establishes a Nuclear Waste Management Planning Council as an independent instrumentality of the Executive branch, the functions of which shall include: (1) providing representatives to the Nuclear Waste Coordinating Committee; (2) advising Federal agencies and departments having membership on the Committee; and (3) providing views on the annual Nuclear Waste Management Plan to the President. Title III: Establishment, Membership, and Functions of Nuclear Waste Coordinating Committee - Establishes a Nuclear Waste Coordinating Committee as an independent instrumentality in the Executive branch. Charges the Committee with coordinating Federal activities with respect to nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel management and preparing an annual Nuclear Waste Management Plan for fiscal years 1983 through 1987. Requires the Committee to notify the Governor of any State in which the Committee has decided to undertake a study. Requires the Committee to prepare for submission to Congress a nuclear waste Repository Development Report when any Federal agency has made application for a license to construct the main shaft of a nuclear waste repository. Prohibits the undertaking of site preparation work until such Report has been submitted. Requires that Congress pass a concurrent resolution permitting such construction when the Chairman of a State Review Panel (see title IV) formally objects to such Report. Provides that such Report shall be considered rejected unless Congress passes a concurrent resolution of approval within 60 days of continuous session. Prohibits any Federal agency from emplacing significant quantities of nuclear waste into a repository unless the Committee submits to Congress, at the earliest feasible time, a Repository Loading Report. Title IV: Establishment, Membership, and Functions of Nuclear Waste Repository Review Panels - Authorizes the Governor of any State receiving notification of the intention of the Committee to prepare a Repository Development Report to establish a Nuclear Waste Repository Review Panel to facilitate State and local participation in the planning and development of such repository. Requires a Panel to review regularly current and planned federal actions with respect to the siting, construction, and operation of the proposed nuclear waste repository. Authorizes the Chairman of the Panel to submit to the Committee formal objections which state that the Repository Development Report does not adequately provide for the protection of State and local interests."
