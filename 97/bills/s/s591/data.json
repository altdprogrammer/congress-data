    "text": "Debt Collection Act of 1981 - Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to permit a Federal agency to disclose individual records to a consumer reporting agency. Authorizes a Federal agency attempting to collect a claim under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 to notify a consumer reporting agency that a person is responsible for a claim if: (1) the agency has sent a written notice informing the person that a consumer reporting agency will be contacted, describing the information to be disclosed, and explaining the person's right to dispute the agency's claim; (2) the person has not agreed to repay the claim or filed for review of the claim; (3) the agency, upon request, has reviewed the claim; and (4) the agency has obtained assurances that the consumer reporting agency complies with Federal laws governing the provision of consumer credit information. Authorizes an agency to deduct installment payments from the pay of an employee or member of the Armed Forces or Armed Forces Reserve to offset any debts owed to the Government. Limits the amount deducted to one-half of the individual's pay. Permits such deduction only after the agency has notified the employee of: (1) the agency's intention to garnish the employee's pay; and (2) the employee's rights to inspect the agency's records, to a review of the agency's determination of indebtedness, and to enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to authorize: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose a taxpayer's address to an agency collecting a Federal claim against the taxpayer; (2) the agency to redisclose such information to a consumer reporting agency; and (3) the redisclosure of such information by the consumer reporting agency. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish regulations requiring each agency with outstanding debts to submit annual reports on the amount and number of such debts, the cost to the agency of collecting debts, and other information on the agency's debt collection activities. Requires the Director to report annually to Congress on the management of agency debt collection activities."
