Title II: Rebuilding of America Act - Rebuilding of America Act of 1982 - Directs the National Commission on the Rebuilding of America, established by this Act, to conduct an inventory of existing major public improvements (highways, roads, bridges, and water and sewer systems) by region, State, and major metropolitan areas of the United States. Requires the Commission to develop a National Public Improvements Plan listing in priority order maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of public improvements which will be necessary in each region, to sustain regionally balanced national economic development. Requires the Commission, as a part of the plan, to suggest specific revisions in Federal laws, regulations, and policies that may be necessary to reverse the pattern of disinvestment in national public improvements. Sets forth procedures for the submission of such plan to Congress and for review and implementation of the plan. Establishes the National Commission on the Rebuilding of America to assess the condition of the national public works infrastructure. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act. Directs the Comptroller General to submit to specified congressional committees model unified budgets for the year of enactment of this Act and the preceding fiscal year that distinguish Federal civilian capital investment outlays from other Federal outlays. Requires the Comptroller General to include with such budgets a report on their usefulness."
