Authorizes a special verdict of \"not guilty only by reason of insanity.\" Provides for mandatory confinement of a person found not guilty by reason of insanity for the crimes of murder and attempted murder. Requires the court to commit such person to the custody of the Attorney General upon a preponderance of the evidence that the person is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect and he should, in lieu of being sentenced to probation or imprisonment, be committed to a suitable facility for care and treatment. Requires the court to proceed to sentencing upon the certification by the director of the facility that such person has recovered."
