    "text": "Hazardous Waste Identification Improvement Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to revise provisions relating to criteria for identification and listing of hazardous waste. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), when evaluating a petition to exclude a waste generated at a particular facility from being listed as a hazardous waste, to consider criteria other than those for which the waste was listed if the Administrator has a reasonable basis to believe that such additional criteria could cause such waste to be listed as a hazardous waste. Directs the Administrator to grant or deny such petition only after the petitioner and all interested parties have been given notice and opportunity for public hearing with respect to such additional criteria and to demonstrate whether such waste meets such criteria. Directs the Administrator to develop, and submit to the Congress by July 1, 1983, a two-year plan for: (1) revising or adding new characteristics for identifying hazardous waste; and (2) the listing of those hazardous wastes which are not so listed on the date of enactment of this Act, with a determination with respect to the listing of dioxin and certain organic and inorganic waste streams (described in a specified document) to be made prior to March 1, 1983; and (3) an evaluation of possible determinations as to the levels of certain hazardous constituents which may cause wastes to be hazardous per se. Directs the Administrator to submit progress reports on such program on January 1, 1984, and January 1, 1985, in conjunction with the submittal of the proposed budget for EPA, to the appropriate congressional committees. Provides that such amendments shall become effective on the date of enactment of this Act, and required regulations shall be promulgated within 180 days after such date."
