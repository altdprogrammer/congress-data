Directs the Secretary to retain public interest rights (scenic, wildlife, recreation, and public access) in any conveyance of System lands. States that any person receiving: (1) such land shall pay the associated conveyance costs; or (2) a road right-of-way shall reimburse the Government for improvements. Permits the Secretary to waive these provisions. States that: (1) conveyances of road rights-of- way shall be used or maintained according to State or local laws; and (2) nothing in this title authorizes conveyances of public lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, or the National Forest Monuments. Prohibits the sale, but not other forms of conveyance, of Federal lands in National Recreation Areas. Amends Federal law to permit State, county, and local governmental bodies to participate in System land exchanges (currently limited to public school authorities) to the extent that such lands: (1) are already in use by these bodies; and (2) are used for the same purposes."
