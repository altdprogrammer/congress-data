    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-11-18", 
    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Regulatory Reform Act - Revises regulatory procedures under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Permits petitions for judicial review of administrative actions under such Act to be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the U.S. court of appeals for a judicial circuit in which a substantial portion of the associated impact or injury will occur. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in proposing and promulgating such regulations, to consider any relevant advice or recommendations of the National Drinking Water Advisory Council, and any separate statements by individual Council members as provided under this Act. Requires that a promulgated rule be accompanied by statements of: (1) its basis and purpose; (2) the reasons for any major changes from the proposed rule; (3) factual data and reasons supporting a determination that the benefits of applying the rule justify the compliance costs; (4) the reasons why any public comment alternatives to the proposed rule were rejected; and (5) response to significant public comment, criticism, and new data submissions. Prohibits basing the promulgated rule on any information not in the docket. Revises standards for primary drinking water regulations. Replaces regulation of contaminants having \"any adverse effect\" on human health with regulation of contaminants \"posing an unreasonable risk to human health\". Removes a requirement that such regulations provide for proper operation and maintenance of public water systems, minimum quality of water taken into the systems, and new facilities siting. Eliminates specified references to the Administrator's judgments or determinations and to allowance for \"an adequate margin of safety\" in promulgating such regulations. Requires the maximum contaminant level specified in revised national primary drinking water regulations for a contaminant to be as close to the recommended maximum contaminant level as is \"reasonable\" (currently, \"feasible\"). Removes specified provisions relating to requirements for the use of treatment techniques. Continues State primary enforcement responsibility whenever the Administrator revises or amends any national primary drinking water regulation. Requires a State with primary enforcement responsibility to show the Administrator that the State public water system supervision program meets the revised or added requirement, within a specified period. Requires the Administrator's approval of continuation of the State's primary enforcement responsibility. Authorizes the Administrator to waive a prohibition against making grants to State public water system supervision programs that have not assumed and maintained primary enforcement responsibility. Permits such waiver during any time within 18 months after the effective date of any amendment or revision of the national regulations if the State has assumed such responsibility and is making a diligent effort to comply with the new amendment or revision. Authorizes the Administrator to grant a State an additional six months to come into compliance, on a showing of good cause. Revises provisions relating to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council. Provides for sixteen members, with four each from four membership categories: (1) the general public; (2) scientists expert in public health and water hygiene; (3) representatives of State and local agencies concerned with water hygiene and public water supply; and (4) representatives of both publicly owned and private investor owned suppliers of water. Requires the Council to elect a Chairman and adopt rules for calling and conducting meetings. Requires that any recommendation or advice to the Administrator be: (1) voted upon specifically by the Council; and (2) accompanied by any separate statements of dissenting or supplementary views submitted by any Council member. Repeals a provision that allows national interim primary drinking water regulations to be amended from time to time."
