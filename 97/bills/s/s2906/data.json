Eliminates the requirement that the Armed Services Committees be given 30 days notice of any changes in the quantity of any material to be stockpiled. Eliminates the requirement that certain expenditures for and disposals from the stockpile must be specifically authorized. Permits the President to dispose of materials as he determines necessary. Permits the President to waive the requirement that dispositions be made by competitive procedures without giving the Armed Services Committees 30 days notice of such intent. Eliminates the requirement that the President report to the Armed Services Committees whenever he exercises his disposal authority. Eliminates the President's biannual and annual reports to Congress concerning the operation of the stockpile."
