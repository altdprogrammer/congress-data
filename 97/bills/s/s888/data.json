  "summary": {
    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-04-07", 
    "text": "Economic Equity Act - Title I: Tax and Retirement Matters - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that the maximum deduction for contributions to an individual retirement plan: (1) shall be computed separately for each individual who is married; and (2) in the case of a married individual who has no compensation or less compensation than that of the spouse, shall be determined as if such compensation were the same as that of the individual's spouse. Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to require that a retirement plan that provides an annuity to a participant with at least ten years of creditable service shall provide a survivor's annuity for the spouse of a participant who dies before the annuity starting date in an amount not less than the amount that would have been made under the survivor's annuity if the participant had survived and retired on such annuity date. Provides that a participant's election not to take a joint and survivor's annuity shall not be effective unless the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such an election. Allows the assignment of the benefits of a qualified retirement plan in the case of a judgment decree or order relating to child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights pursuant to a State domestic relations law. Amends ERISA to lower the age limitation for participation in a qualified retirement plan from age 25 to age 21. Amends ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code to provide for accruals of creditable service to continue while an individual is on approved maternity or paternity leave at the rate of 20 hours service for each week of approved leave. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase the zero bracket amount; (2) lower the tax rate; (3) decrease withholding requirements; and (4) increase minimum filing requirements for heads of households. Entitles former spouses of members of the uniformed services, civil service employees, and Members of Congress, who were married for at least ten years during creditable service, to an annuity based upon a portion of retired or retainer pay. Amends the Survivor Benefit Plan of the uniformed services to make former spouses eligible for annuities under such plan. Provides for survivor's annuities for surviving former spouses of civil service employees or Members of Congress. Provides that the election of a member of the uniformed services, civil service employee, or Member of Congress not to make a joint and survivor's annuity shall not be effective unless the spouse and any former spouse consents in writing to such an election. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit to employers of displaced homemakers. Title II: Day Care Program - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the formula for determining the tax credit for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. Provides that such credit may exceed tax liability. Increases the dollar limit for such credit from $2,000 to $2,500 (from $4,000 to $5,000 for two or more dependents). Allows a higher limit in the case of a taxpayer with children under two years of age. Increases the earned income limitation for such credit in the case of a spouse who is a student or incapable of self-care. Provides that employers may make advance payments of the credit to qualified employees. Excludes from gross income of an employee any amounts paid or expenses incurred by the employer for dependent care assistance to such employee. Title III: Armed Forces - Revises the rules for the distribution of the property of deceased members of the Air Force and Army by removing any gender distinctions from such rules. Establishes a distribution formula based on six classes: (1) beneficiary named in a will; (2) surviving spouse; (3) children; (4) parents; (5) siblings; and (6) next of kin. Eliminates sexual distinctions with regard to promotion procedures and procedures to remove reserve officers from active duty status in the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve. Requires the Secretary of Defense to make an annual report to the Congress concerning the status of women in the armed forces. Title IV: Estate Tax on Agricultural Property and Farm Loans - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the unified credit against the estate and gift tax from $47,000 to $192,800 by specified annual increments through 1985. Increases the minimum gross estate requirement for filing a return from $175,000 to $600,000. Qualifies estates of decedents who were disabled or retired for the special valuation of certain farms based on use if they materially participated in the operation of the farm for five out of eight years preceding the year in which they became disabled or eligible for disability benefits. Permits the spouse of a decedent to use such valuation if the spouse has managed the farm or business for ten years preceding the decedent's death or during the period beginning on the date of deaths of the decedent and ending on the date of death of the spouse. Permits active management rather than material participation as a test for qualification of the estate for spouses, children under 21, students, and disabled individuals who received property from a decedent who qualified for special use valuation. Repeals the $500,000 limitation on the reduction of the value of qualified real property permitted by the special use valuation. Provides that the interest rate on extended payments of estate taxes shall be the lower of six percent or 75 percent of the prime rate. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to remove the preference to married persons in receiving farm improvement loans. Title V: Nondiscrimination in Insurance Act - Prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the consideration of applications for, or the granting of, insurance policies and the terms of such policies. Permits insurers who regularly provide insurance solely to persons of a single religious affiliation to continue to do so. Grants to State or local governments having insurance discrimination laws the primary opportunity to enforce this Act. Permits an aggrieved person to file a civil action in State or Federal court against an insurer, if a State or local authority: (1) has received notice of a complaint and fails to act within 60 days; or (2) has no insurance discrimination laws. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action in district court when there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or group is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the rights granted by this Act and that such denial raises an issue of general public importance. Title VI: Regulatory Reform and Sex Neutrality - Requires the heads of each Federal administrative agency to conduct a review of the regulations of that agency to assure that such regulations are sex neutral. Requires that, to the extent practicable, all rules, regulations, documents, and other writings of Federal administrative agencies shall use words that are neutral as to gender, unless the subject matter specifically applies only to one sex or the words used do not result in sex-based discrimination. Title VII: Study of Enforcement of Alimony and Child Support Payments - Directs the Attorney General to undertake a study of the appropriate role of the Federal Government in the enforcement of delinquent payments of alimony, child support, and property settlement orders against an absent spouse or parent. Requires the Attorney General to submit to the President and the Congress not later than one year after enactment of this Act a report of such study together with recommendations for appropriate legislation."
