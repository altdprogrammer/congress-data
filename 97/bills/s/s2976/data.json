    "text": "Defense Economic Adjustment Act - Title I: Defense Economic Adjustment Council - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Defense Economic Adjustment Council to be cochaired by the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor. Establishes in the Executive Office an Office of Economic Adjustment, headed by a Director, to provide staff support to the Council. Directs the Council to disseminate information from the Secretary of Defense to Federal, State, and local agencies concerning proposed or pending changes in defense spending which would affect employment in the defense industry. Requires the Council to perform other duties, including: (1) soliciting, directing, and coordinating plans for private and public projects which will provide new employment opportunities; (2) providing technical assistance to communities to plan for economic conversion; (3) coordinating its activities with the Center for Utilization of Federal Technology; (4) monitoring the existing job services information bank in the Department of Labor; and (5) determining criteria for eligibility for assistance. Directs the Secretary of Defense to provide the pertinent information to the Council in advance of any change and to furnish the Council with projected future defense spending levels. Directs the Council to prepare and distribute a Conversion Guidelines Handbook to outline requirements of programs for professional retraining of personnel. Title II: Alternative Use Committees - Requires the establishment of separate management and labor alternative use committees by each defense facility and contractor employing at least 100 persons to plan for economic conversion in the event of closure or reduction. Penalizes any contractor who fails to submit an alternative use plan or carry out one approved by the Council by making such contractor ineligible for future defense contracts for three years. Directs such committees to: (1) evaluate the assets of the facilities and the resources and requirements of the local community; (2) develop at least biennially a detailed plan for conversion of the facility to non-defense-related productive activity; and (3) provide retraining and reemployment counseling service. Requires conversion plans: (1) to describe the new use to which the converted facility would be put; (2) to maximize the pool of skills of available personnel; and (3) to specify in detail the composition of the work force and plant, material, and financing requirements. Title III: Economic Adjustment Fund - Establishes in the Treasury an Economic Adjustment Fund to finance the activities of the Alternative Use Committees. Requires defense contractors to pay a specified percentage of their contract amounts into the fund. Title IV: Community Economic Adjustment Planning - Makes eligible for Federal assistance for planning for economic adjustment any community which is substantially affected by reduction or elimination of defense facilities or curtailment or conclusion of defense contracts. Directs the Council to utilize data from other departments to develop criteria which insure that assistance is directed to those communities which are most vulnerable economically to reductions in defense expenditures. Requires the Council to publish a semiannual list of eligible communities. Requires excess property resulting from a closing or reduction in a Government-owned facility to be appraised for purposes of resale to the community. Title V: Economic Adjustment Loans and Loan Guarantees - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make or guarantee loans on terms prescribed by the Council to assist contractors and communities to carry out conversion plans. Title VI: Urgent National Requirements for Non-Defense Sectors of the Economy - Directs the Council to designate urgent national requirements for nondefense sectors of the economy for purposes of allocating independent research and development money."
