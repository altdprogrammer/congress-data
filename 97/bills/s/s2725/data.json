Provides that if the decision after the hearing affirms the determination that the individual is not entitled to such benefits, any benefits paid pending the hearing shall be considered overpayments. Makes the requirement that disability determinations under title II be reviewed at least every three years applicable only to the extent that sufficient personnel and processing time are available. Requires the secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the number of cases which may be adequately reviewed by the applicable State agency or by the Secretary. Provides that where fewer than all cases are being reviewed every three years, the Secretary shall establish criteria for giving priority to reviews of those cases in which ineligibility is most likely to be found."
