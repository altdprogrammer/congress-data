    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-413) International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 - Title I: Military and Related Assistance and Sales - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to set the trigger price for transfers of defense equipment, articles, and services which would require the President to submit a certification to Congress before consenting to such transfer. Prohibits the President from consenting to transfers of defense equipment, articles, or services whose value exceeds such trigger price and whose export has been licensed or approved until a specified time after the certification has been submitted to Congress. Deletes the provision which exempted from the certification requirement transfers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), any NATO member, Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. Extends the time within which the President must report the price and availability estimates of such defense articles, services, and major equipment. Retains the current trigger price which would make it necessary for the President to include in such report a request by a foreign country for a letter of offer to sell defense equipment, articles, or services. Increases, with respect to letters of offers to sell, the trigger price of defense equipment, articles, or services which would require the President to submit a specified certification to the appropriate congressional committees. Increases, with respect to applications for export licenses, the trigger price of defense equipment, articles, or services which would require the President to submit a specified certification to Congress. Provides for expedited consideration of transfers of defense materials to NATO, a NATO member, Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. Makes the President's consent to such a transfer effective within 15 (rather than 30) days of its submission to Congress, unless Congress adopts a concurrent resolution disapproving such transfer. Makes such consent effective immediately if an emergency exists. Provides for expedited consideration of such concurrent resolution. Requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours of the existence of, or a change in status of, certain hostilities or terrorist acts (currently after the outbreak of significant hostilities) involving a country in which U.S. personnel are performing certain defense services. Requires such report to include: (1) the country's identity; (2) a description of such hostilities or terrorist acts; (3) the number of U.S. armed forces and civilians who may be endangered (currently the report must also include their location, the nature of their activities, and the likelihood of their becoming endangered). Authorizes the President to reduce or waive certain charges and costs involved in producing defense articles and equipment which would advance standardization of U.S. armed forces with the armed forces of Japan, Australia, or New Zealand.

Provides repayment terms for loans to specified countries under the foreign military sales loan guarantee program. Allots specified amounts of the foreign military sales credits for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for Egypt and the Sudan. Authorizes using specified funds in fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to finance Israeli procurement of defense articles and services. Releases Israel from the duty to repay a specified amount. Repeals the ceiling on commercial arms export sales. Directs the President to review periodically the items on the U.S. Munitions list. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a Special Defense Acquisition Fund to finance the acquisition of defense articles and services in anticipation of their transfer to eligible foreign countries and international organizations. Sets forth the sources of the Fund's money. Limits the size of the Fund. Authorizes the use of such Fund to pay for the costs acquisition and transfer of such defense articles and services. Directs the President to report to Congress annually on acquisitions and likely procurements to be made through the Fund. Prohibits the transfer of any defense articles or services acquired by such Fund to any foreign country or international organization, unless authorized by law. Authorizes the temporary use of such defense articles and services by U.S. armed forces prior to their transfer. Authorizes the President to lease in-stock defense articles to an eligible foreign country or international organization if: (1) the President determines there are compelling foreign policy and national security reasons for leasing rather than selling such articles; (2) the President determines the articles are not presently needed for public use; and (3) the foreign country or international organization has agreed to pay all costs incurred in leasing such articles. Limits each lease agreement to five years duration. Requires each lease to provide that the President may terminate the lease and require immediate return of the leased articles. Authorizes loans for leases of such defense articles. Directs the President to submit a certification to Congress before entering into or renewing such a lease or loan. Authorizes the waiver of such certification if the President reports to Congress that an emergency exists. Prohibits any lease or loan of defense equipment or articles valued at or above specified amounts if Congress objects to the proposed lease or loan by adopting a concurrent resolution. Exempts from such legislative review loans or leases to NATO, any NATO member, Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. Applies laws restricting the countries or organizations in which sales may be made to leases of defense articles under this Act. Makes the Secretary of State responsible for the supervision and general direction of such leases. Requires such leases to meet the same prerequisites for consent by the President as sales of such articles or services. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require loan agreements covering defense articles to provide for restoration or replacement of loaned defense articles which are damaged, lost, or destroyed. Amends the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980 to repeal the provision relating to leasing defense property.

Repeals the provision which terminated the authority to furnish military assistance to any country unless Congress specifically authorized such assistance. Sets the limitation on additions to stockpiles of defense articles for foreign countries for fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Eliminates the requirement of specific congressional authorization for the operation of a military assistance advisory group, military mission, or organization of U.S. military personnel in a foreign country. Authorizes the President to assign U.S. military personnel to a foreign country to perform specified functions. Limits advisory and training assistance conducted by such personnel. Expresses the sense of Congress that advising and training assistance in countries to which such personnel are assigned shall be provided by other personnel who are detailed for limited periods to perform specific tasks. Limits to six the number of such military personnel assigned to a foreign country unless specifically authorized by Congress. Authorizes the President to waive this limitation upon reporting to Congress that U.S. interests require that more than six be assigned to carry out international security assistance programs. Authorizes specified countries to have military personnel strengths larger than six for fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Prohibits the total number of such military personnel assigned to a foreign country from exceeding the number justified to Congress, unless the appropriate congressional committees are notified before the introduction of the additional military personnel. Specifies the funds which will be charged with the costs of overseas management of international security assistance programs. Retains the provisions which: (1) make the Chief of the U.S. Diplomatic Mission responsible for supervising such military personnel; and (2) restrict encouragement by U.S. diplomatic and military personnel of military equipment purchases by foreign countries. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 for: (1) international military education and training; and (2) peacekeeping operations.

Authorizes the use of a specified amount of such funds under the famine prevention and freedom from hunger programs to build agricultural extension services in Egypt for the small farmer. Authorizes the use of a specified amount of such funds for such years for special requirements in the Middle East, if the President makes a specified report to Congress.
