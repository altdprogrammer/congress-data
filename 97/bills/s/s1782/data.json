Authorizes the contracting officer to retain up to ten percent of the progress payments due, in order to protect the Government's interest, if the contractor is not making satisfactory progress on the contract. Requires that amounts retained be returned to the contractor whenever the contracting officer is satisfied with the contractor's progress and upon the agency's final acceptance of the work under the construction contract. Urges the elimination of retainage in construction subcontracts in cases where the subcontractor is performing on time and in a satisfactory manner."
