    "text": "Regulatory Improvements Act of 1981 - Sets forth a schedule for the Congressional evaluation, during the five Congresses succeeding the Ninety-eighth Congress, of regulatory statutes administered by specified agencies in the areas of: (1) energy and the environment; (2) transportation and communication; (3) banking, finance, and the economy; (4) food, health and safety, and housing; and (5) commerce and international trade. Directs the President to review each regulatory statute scheduled for evaluation and to submit to Congress and make available to the public any recommendations for revising such statutes by such means as: (1) transferring, consolidating, or eliminating regulatory functions; (2) using alternative methods such as taxes or penalties to achieve regulatory goals; or (3) requiring sunset reviews of agencies or programs. Requires the President: (1) to provide an opportunity for the head of the administering agency, regulated interests, consumers, and other interested persons to participate in the review; and (2) to consult with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Consumer Adviser, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and other agency heads with relevant expertise in the area under review."
