Directs the Committee to report to Congress on the success of its activities within 18 months of enactment. Terminates the Committee two years from the date of enactment. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to: (1) classify arson as a major crime in the Uniform Crime Reports; and (2) develop a special statistical report for arson in cooperation with the National Fire Data Center. Directs the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration to: (1) conduct a research program for the development of techniques and equipment for use by State and local fire fighting and law enforcement personnel for arson prediction, prevention, and control; (2) establish anti-arson educational and training programs for State and local government; (3) develop materials for community awareness programs; and (4) provide information relative to the prevention, prediction, occurrence, and control of arson. Authorizes appropriations for the Administration for such purpose. Amends the National Housing Act to require that FAIR (fair access to insurance requirements) plans be issued only after insurers obtain information from a prospective policyholder with respect to arson."
