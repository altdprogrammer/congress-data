    "text": "(Reported to senate from the Committee on Finance with amendment, S. Rept. 97-189) Czechoslovakian Claims Settlement Act - Title I: Czechoslovakian Claims Settlements - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to sell all Czechoslovakian gold located in the United States. Authorizes the Secretary to offer Czechoslovakia the right to purchase such gold at the price at which it would otherwise be sold. Directs the Secretary to invest the proceeds of such sale in safe U.S. or foreign securities, the income from which to be used to pay the claims against Czechoslovakia of U.S. nationals and of the U.S. Government. Directs the Secretary to put the income from such investments into the Czechoslovakian Claims Fund. Directs the Secretary to distribute the balance in the Fund at least once every six months. Sets forth the priority of the recipients as follows: (1) to U.S. nationals holding awards against Czechoslovakia certified under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 or holding awards certified under this Act for property nationalized or taken between January 1, 1945, and February 26, 1948; (2) to U.S. nationals holding awards certified under this Act for property nationalized or taken after August 8, 1958; and (3) to the U.S. Treasury for the value of a specified debt and two U.S. bank accounts in Czechoslovakia. Sets forth the method of payment if the entitled person is dead or disabled. Requires certified awards to lapse if the Secretary cannot locate the entitled person within two years. Requires lapsed awards to be added to the Czechoslovakian Claims Fund. Requires the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, upon application, to reopen and redetermine the validity and amount of specified claims against Czechoslovakia. Provides for the payment to Czechoslovakia of all the proceeds from such gold sale and any balance remaining in such Fund after all awards have been paid and Treasury Department expenses are recovered. Denies jurisdiction to any court over any claim against the United States for actions taken under this Act. Title II: Nondiscriminatory Treatment - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to deny Czechoslovakia eligibility for nondiscriminatory (most-favored nation) treatment until its gold is sold as provided under this Act."
