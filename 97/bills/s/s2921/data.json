    "text": "Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1982 - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to name title XI of such Act the Regulatory Budget Act of 1982. Includes the achievement of a balanced Federal budget under most economic circumstances and the control of Federal credit activities as purposes of such Act. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office or the Committees on the Budget of the Senate and of the House, in determining current law budget authority, outlays, and spending authority for a fiscal year, to: (1) include adjustments for additional costs, workloads, or utilizations only if such adjustments, and the budget authority and spending authority for them, are provided by statute at the time such determinations are made; and (2) assume that new budget authority will be enacted for programs or activities for a fiscal year in an amount equal to that authorized for the prior fiscal year, when no such authority has yet been enacted. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to change the annual reporting date for the Congressional Budget Office to March 1. Requires such report to include five-year estimates of credit activity and of the ratio of outlays and revenues to the gross national product. Amends the budget timetable to make July 15 the date for Congress to complete action on the deficit reduction bill. Eliminates any second concurrent resolution on the budget and any reconciliation bill. Requires the concurrent resolution on the budget to be for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the year in which it is adopted and each of the four succeeding fiscal years. Sets forth information to be included in such resolution, excluding a deficit except under special conditions. Permits the Committees on the Budget of the House and the Senate, to report deficit reduction legislation if other committees fail to meet their deficit reduction directions by specified dates. Prohibits a deficit reduction bill or resolution from containing provisions which: (1) decrease the total amount of Federal revenues for a fiscal year below the level of current law revenues; or (2) accomplish decreases in outlays in one fiscal year by postponing such outlays to one or more succeeding fiscal years. Excludes provisions which are predominantly nonbudgetary in nature. Requires Congress to complete action on any deficit reduction bill or resolution by July 15 of each year. Permits floor amendments to propose alternative deficit reduction legislation. Requires the concurrent resolution on the budget to include a regulatory budget. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the budget resolution to be balanced. Makes it out of order in either the House or the Senate to consider any budget resolution for any fiscal year beginning FY 1984, or amendment to it or conference report, which would cause outlays to exceed revenues. Prohibits the recommended level of Federal revenues set forth in a budget resolution from exceeding a certain ratio to the gross national product determined according to a specified formula. Allows either the House or the Senate Budget Committee to report, and Congress to pass, a separate concurrent resolution setting forth a level of Federal revenues higher than that determined according to such formula. Declares that the determination of outlays, revenues, and gross national product shall be made on the basis of estimates made by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. Makes such balanced budget provisions inapplicable in time of war. Provides for a waiver of such requirements in time of recession by a majority roll call vote. Requires that any surplus in the budget be used to pay back any recession-based deficits, plus interest. Requires a revised budget resolution with a deficit reduction bill if mid-year re-estimates show unanticipated deficit. Requires, to the extent that the deficit cannot be eliminated in the current year, that the next year's budget resolution contain a provision instructing the appropriate committees to report temporary increases in revenues sufficient to pay off such debt. Requires expenditures and revenues, including outlays for credit activities, to be included in the budget resolution estimates. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to require that the budget submitted by the President include budget authority, direct loans, and commitments to guarantee loan principal, and estimates of outlays and receipts for all activities of all departments, agencies, establishments, and instrumentalities of the Federal government. Requires the Committee on Appropriations of each House to subdivide among its subcommittees its allocation of gross obligations for direct loans and loan guarantee commitments. Permits revisions of the budget resolution to include changes in the deficit reduction instructions. Makes it out of order in either House to consider any resolution providing for the adjournment sine die of either House unless: (1) action has been completed on the budget resolution and, if a deficit reduction bill or resolution is required to be reported, unless the action has been completed on those measures; (2) action has been completed on all continuing appropriation bills and resolutions; and (3) the Committees on the Budget of the House and Senate have each reported a notice certifying that the total amounts of new budget authority and budget outlays comply with the specified allocations of such authority and outlays among the congressional committees. Sets forth limitations on legislation providing authority to make direct loans or to guarantee loan principal. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to add a Title XI: Regulatory Budget Procedure. Requires the President to establish criteria and methods for determining the costs of compliance with agency rules and regulations. Requires the head of each Federal agency to report annually to the Office of Management and Budget on such costs. Directs the President to include in his Budget for each fiscal year a regulatory budget for each agency recommending maximum compliance costs for such year. Requires all new legislation to be within the regulatory budget. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 to require the President's budget to conform to this Act."
