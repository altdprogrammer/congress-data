Requires the Secretary to publish timely notice of all awards of Government procurement contracts set aside for small businesses. Directs the Secretary to investigate, and authorizes the Secretary to implement alternative means of notifying small businesses of procurement actions. Prohibits a Federal agency from awarding a procurement contract for which a notice for bidding must be published until 45 days after the publication of such notice, or the closing date for bidding on the action specified in the notice, whichever is later. Requires each Federal agency, to the extent practicable, to subdivide large systems procurement contracts into smaller components on which small businesses can compete. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to establish Government procurement contract arbitration panels for resolving contract disputes between small businesses and Federal agencies. Makes the use of such a panel voluntary. Establishes a Small Business Procurement Advisory Committee to advise Congress and the Administrator on Government procurement contracts awarded to, or set aside for, small businesses. Requires the Committee to report annually to Congress and the Administrator on its activities and to make recommendations for increasing the number of Government procurement contracts awarded to small businesses."
