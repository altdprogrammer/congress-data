Establishes mandatory terms of imprisonment if any person's life is endangered by use of a dangerous weapon or if any person is assaulted, killed, or forced without his consent to accompany the offender during commission of the offense. Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (through the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration) to meet regularly with the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners to assure successful enforcement of such offenses. Requires the Department of Justice to include pharmacy crime data in its annual Uniform Crime Reports. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
