Requires bond issuing authorities to conduct public hearings prior to the approval and issuance of any small issue industrial development bond. Requires the Governor of a State to report to the Secretary of the Treasury annually beginning in 1984 on bonds issued during the preceding year. Increases to $15,000,000 the amount of industrial development bonds used for economically distressed areas which qualify as tax-exempt small issues. Permits the financing of office buildings, restaurants, stores or shopping centers in such areas. Specifies requirements relating to poverty for designation as a qualified distressed area. Provides that capital research and experimental expenditures shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the aggregate face value of industrial development bonds which otherwise qualify for the small issue exemption. Suspends temporary Internal Revenue Service regulations which prohibit pooled issues of bonds for projects located in only one state with respect to bonds sold after August 23, 1981. Sets forth transitional rules and effective dates."
