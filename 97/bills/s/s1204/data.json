R. 3071) Quiet Communities Act - Amends the Noise Control Act of 1972 to retitle such Act the \"Quiet Communities Act.\" Replaces a finding that Federal action is necessary to control major noise sources in commerce with a finding that Federal action must assure uniform treatment of certain carriers engaged in interstate commerce and certain transportation equipment distributed in interstate commerce which are major noise sources. Limits the authority of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish noise emission standards. Provides that such Federal regulations shall apply only to transportation equipment and to motors or engines designed for use in transportation equipment. Repeals provisions for: (1) EPA noise control regulations pertaining to product labeling; and (2) prohibitions relating to such regulations. Authorizes States to bring civil actions in U.S. district courts to impose penalties against violators of prohibitions under such Act. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 and 1983."
