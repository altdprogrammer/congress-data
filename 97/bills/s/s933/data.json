Redesignates such projects as the \"Belle Fourche Unit\" of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate and execute an amendatory repayment contract with the Belle Fourche Irrigation District covering all lands of the existing Belle Fourche project. Provides for repayment of certain construction and rehabilitation and betterment costs of the Belle Fourche unit from the net revenues of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program within 50 years after execution of such amendatory contract. Sets forth acreage limitations for land held in beneficial ownership by one owner within the project, which are eligible to receive water by means of project works. Permits costs incurred under the provisions of this Act to be covered by appropriations for the Water and Power Resources Service. Authorizes the Secretary to amend existing contracts and enter into additional contracts to implement any future agreement between the Belle Fourche Irrigation District and non-Federal entities involving the sale of project water for other than irrigation purposes. Provides for the disposition of net proceeds from such transactions. Authorizes appropriations beginning October 1, 1982."
