Provides for the refundability of such credit. Requires the maintenance of a separate account for amounts received as credit refunds. Limits withdrawals from such accounts to amounts used for maintenance, improvement, or acquisition of property or payment of the railroad retirement tax. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to reserve amounts received pursuant to imposition of the windfall profit tax equal to the decrease in revenues attributable to this Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the purposes of this Act."
