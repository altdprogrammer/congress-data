    "text": "Energy Assistance Block Grant Act - Adds a new title to the Social Security Act, title XXI (Block Grants for Energy and Emergency Assistance). Establishes the Energy Assistance Trust Fund in the Treasury. Appropriates amounts to the trust fund, through fiscal year 1985, out of amounts received from the windfall profit tax on domestic crude oil. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress concerning the fund. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make allotments from the Fund to each State, from which a State must spend at least 90 percent for home energy assistance to assist individuals and families most in need, and to meet emergency income maintenance needs. Directs the Secretary to make payments in accordance with the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968. Requires a State, before a grant is made, to complete and publish a report after holding public hearings covering the use of funds available under this Act. Requires each report to: (1) include a program of coordinated delivery of weatherization and energy assistance; (2) give priority to the elderly, the handicapped, and those individuals who are neediest by virtue of having the lowest incomes and the highest energy costs in relation to income; (3) provide for outreach activities; (4) assure that those individuals eligible for assistance based on income eligibility under Federal law will not be treated differently from others not so eligible; (5) treat renters and homeowners the same; (6) provide that benefits be related to home energy costs in relation to income; and (7) prohibit benefits to households with incomes higher than the lower living standard income level or 125 percent of the poverty level, whichever is higher. Requires a State to annually report on and audit its expenditures. Repeals the Home Energy Assistance Act of 1980, specified provisions of part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act relating to emergency assistance, and the Emergency Energy Conservation Services program authorized pursuant to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964."
