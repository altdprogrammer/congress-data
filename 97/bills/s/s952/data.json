    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-04-08", 
    "text": "Amends the Vocational Education Act of 1963 to revise provisions for the program of grants to States for vocational education by eliminating categorical requirements and to eliminate certain national programs. Authorizes appropriations for such program for fiscal years 1982 through 1986. Eliminates provisions which required: (1) a minimum State allotment based on a specified previous allotment; and (2) specified percentages of such State allotments to be available for designated programs. Eliminates provisions which required: (1) that State boards certify as to (a) specified delegations of their responsibilities and (b) specified opportunities for involvement in planning by certain groups or individuals; and (2) reservation of funds for a specified purpose. Eliminates requirements for State advisory councils relating to: (1) membership terms; (2) certification of establishment and membership; (3) meetings, selection of a chairman, rules for operating procedures and staffing; and (4) the duty to publish evaluations of vocational education programs, services, and activities assisted under such Act. Authorizes appropriations for grants to State advisory councils for fiscal years 1982 through 1986. Eliminates requirements that general applications for assistance under such Act include assurances that: (1) annual applications by eligible recipients will include descriptions of the relationship between the proposed vocational education programs and other programs in the area or community which are supported by State and local funds; and (2) no program will receive funds which cannot demonstrate specified types of results. Requires that such general applications assure that first priority will be given to applicants located in economically depressed and high unemployment areas (and only then will priority be given to applicants proposing new types of programs). Eliminates requirements for five-year State plans relating to: (1) meetings during the planning year between representatives of the State board and representatives of specified agencies, councils, and individuals; (2) appeals of State board planning decisions by such agencies or councils; (3) explicit descriptions of planned uses of funds in specified terms and with demonstrations of necessity, including descriptions of intended uses of funds to meet the special needs of handicapped and disadvantaged persons and persons with limited English-speaking ability; and (4) the special programs and placement services for displaced homemakers, single heads of households, part-time workers, and those seeking jobs in areas not traditionally considered job areas for those of their gender. Eliminates requirements for annual program plans and accountability reports relating to: (1) meetings between representatives of the State board and representatives of specified agencies, councils, and individuals; (2) appeals of State board decisions by such agencies or councils; (3) planning provisions setting forth explicitly the uses the State intends to make of such funds for a given fiscal year as these were set forth in this Act and differences between such uses and those which were set forth in the five-year plan; (4) reporting provisions including descriptions of goals and uses in specified terms and descriptions of uses for State administration and among specified authorized uses; and (5) modifications to avoid duplication of data-collection. Eliminates approval requirements that: (1) the Secretary of Education's findings as to the compliance of five-year plans and annual program plans and accountability reports with the provisions of such Act be in writing; (2) such plans and reports be reviewed by appropriate Federal vocational education agencies and by State agencies to assure equal access by both men and women to such programs; and (3) States compile such plans or reports with nationally uniform definitions and information elements. Eliminates requirements that specified percentages of assistance to States for vocational education be allotted to specified categories of programs. Sets forth the authorized uses of such assistance. Requires that State boards make specific findings that use of such funds for a particular activity is necessary due to inadequate services or inadequate funding of similar programs. Eliminates provisions for payments to States for the basic grant programs and for program improvement and supportive services for persons with special needs. Repeals provisions for Federal payment of part of the cost of State administration and implementation of specified plans and purposes. Directs the Secretary to pay the costs of State preparation of five-year plans, annual program plans, and accountability reports and of evaluations of programs. Directs the Bureau of Occupational and Adult Education to continue a review of such programs during fiscal years 1982 through 1987. Directs the Department of Education to continue a fiscal audit of such programs during the same period. Eliminates the program of basic grants to States for vocational education programs in specified categories, including work study programs, cooperative vocational education programs, energy education grants for coal mining technology and installation of solar energy equipment, and residential vocation schools. Eliminates grants for program improvement and supportive services, including research coordinating units, exemplary and innovative programs, curriculum development projects, vocational guidance and counseling, vocational education personnel training, and grants to assist in overcoming sex bias. Eliminates special programs for disadvantaged persons. Eliminates consumer and homemaking education programs. Eliminates all provisions for national programs for vocational education, with the exception of provisions for vocational education data and occupational information data systems. Revises the latter provisions to repeal specified deadlines for required activities of the Secretary of Education, the Administrator of the National Center for Education Statistics, and the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. Eliminates outdated provisions relating to the Bureau of Occupational and Adult Education. Eliminates provisions for the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. Eliminates specified programs of national significance, a national center for research in vocational education, personnel training and development programs, bilingual vocational training programs, and emergency assistance for remodeling and renovation of vocational education facilities. Revises definitions under such Act to conform to amendments made by this Act (such as the elimination of the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education) and by previous transfers of authority to the Secretary of Education."
