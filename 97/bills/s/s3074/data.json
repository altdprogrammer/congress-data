Uses Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks to compensate participating farmers. Requires that not more than 50 percent of a county's acreage be diverted in order to minimize the adverse effect on local economies. Requires that all producers of a particular crop have an equal opportunity to participate in 1983. Authorizes future participation through bids or otherwise as the Secretary determines. Permits base acreage consolidation to encourage program participation. Sets forth payment provisions, including a requirement that the value of a commodity received by a producer be at least 75 percent of the basic county loan rate for such commodity. Requires safeguards to protect affected tenants and sharecroppers. Title II: Expansion of Markets For, And the Disposition of, United States Agricultural Commodities - Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to authorize the Secretary to give excess CCC stocks free to U.S. processors and exporters, and to foreign nations to encourage U.S. commodity exports. Directs the Secretary to: (1) use such stocks to make additional sales or to offset foreign export subsidies; (2) prevent the resale or transshipment of such stocks; and (3) provide subsidies to domestic industries hurt by imports made in whole or in part from such stocks. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to permit CCC commodity and dairy stocks to be donated abroad through foreign governments and humanitarian organizations. Coordinates such donations through the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480). Permits such stocks to be used to expand the foreign exports under such Act. Amends the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 to provide that whenever a commodity is made available without charge or credit, the Secretary shall encourage its consumption through agreements with private companies under which the commodity is processed into end products for use by eligible recipients, with the expense to be borne by the recipients. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to permit the Secretary to sell CCC stocks of long staple cotton for unrestricted use at appropriate price levels. Encourages the Secretary to donate or sell abroad excess CCC dairy stocks during FY 1983 through 1985. Requires a semi-annual report to Congress. Directs the President to report to Congress by December 31, 1982, respecting a new long-term grain sale agreement with the Soviet Union."
