Permits political subdivisions to bail-out of the preclearance requirements independently of the State. Conditions a declaratory judgment for bail-out on the jurisdiction's showing that it met the bailout requirements for a five-year period prior to the filing of the suit. Includes among the requirements for bailout that: (1) no test or device has been used for the purpose or with the effect of voting discrimination; (2) all substantial submissions have been made; (3) no unremedied objections by the Attorney General remain; and (4) there have been no final judgments that the jurisdiction purposefully denied voting rights. Permits jurisdictions to bring a bailout action in the Federal court in which the action arises (currently, actions are limited to the District Court for the District of Columbia)."
