Makes such conditions applicable to all exports of hazardous wastes. Directs the Secretary to list annually for Congress: (1) hazardous wastes for which validated export licenses are required; (2) the number and type of applications received for the export of such wastes; and (3) hazardous wastes for which export licenses were granted."
