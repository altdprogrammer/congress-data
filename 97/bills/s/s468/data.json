Requires that such committee include former POW's, disabled veterans, and individuals who are recognized authorities in certain fields of medicine. Directs the Committee to submit to the Administrator for transmittal to Congress a biennial report on such programs and activities. Reduces from six months to 30 days the minimum period of imprisonment necessary to trigger the presumption that specified diseases and disabilities are confinement-related. Makes POW's held for any period of time, with the disease of psychosis which becomes manifest to a degree of ten percent, presumptively eligible for wartime disability benefits. Entitles former POW's to hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care. Entitles such veterans to priority in the furnishing of medical services. Directs the Administrator, after consulting with the Advisory Committee to conduct and report to Congress on a further study of the health of former POW's. Permits former POW's to file a claim for disability compensation based upon a mental disorder previously disallowed."
