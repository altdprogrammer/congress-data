Limits the availability of such entitlement to elementary and secondary school programs and to expenditures made during fiscal years 1981 through 1984 which the Secretary of Education determines to be reasonable. Prohibits entitlement payments for: (1) any amounts reimbursed or entitled to be reimbursed under any other provision of Federal law; or (2) activities covered by special amounts set aside for the administration of a State plan or application. Sets forth application requirements for such entitlements. Provides for a withholding of entitlement payments in cases of failure to comply with applicable provisions. Sets forth procedures for entitlement payments. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1985."
