    "text": "Ozone Depletion Validation Act of 1981 - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to continue ozone protection studies and research while increasing actual measurements of stratosphere ozone and improving methods of monitoring potential trends in such measurements. Directs the Administrator to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to: (1) continue review and research; (2) determine the extent, nature, and causes of changes in stratospheric ozone concentration (with particular attention to the effects of chlorofluorocarbons); (3) investigate unreasonable effects on health and the environment; and (4) report all findings and associated uncertainties. Prohibits the Administrator from proposing further regulations for the control in the United States of any chlorofluorocarbon: (1) until an international agreement or agreements among major free-world producing countries of chlorofluorocarbons are reached as to the nature, extent, and implications of any threat to the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and as to the appropriate regulatory action to be taken; or (2) until depletion of the stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbons at a rate determined to be eventually harmful to human health and the environment is actually detected. Provides that any such final regulation not take effect until at least 90 days after its promulgation and not until the expiration of the period provided for adoption of a resolution of disapproval. Requires that continuing research and monitoring programs be expanded to determine the extent, nature, causes, effects, and associated uncertainties of stratospheric ozone concentration changes. Directs the National Academy of Sciences, in consultation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to report, within two years and annually thereafter until such time as the theory of ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons has been validated, all findings concerning actual or potential alteration of the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere, its causes, and associated implications and uncertainties. Requires that such report be made to the Administrator and to the Congress, with copies available to the public. Directs the President, within two years from the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, to report to the Congress and the public on efforts to reach international agreements among the major free-world producing countries of chlorofluorocarbons as to the nature, extent, and implications of any threat to the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and as to the appropriate regulatory action to be taken. Prohibits States or local governments from adopting or attempting to enforce any regulation (except ones controlling halocarbon use as an aerosol propellant) respecting the control of chlorofluorocarbons to protect the stratosphere or stratospheric ozone until the Administrator has promulgated such regulations for such control in the United States. Provides that this Act shall not affect: (1) the validity of regulations concerning aerosol propellants containing chlorofluorocarbons promulgated by the Administrator before the effective date of this Act; or (2) the Administrator's obligation to comply with other applicable requirements in adopting regulations for the control of chlorofluorocarbons consistent with international agreements or after actual detection of eventually harmful depletion. Requires that such final regulations be submitted to the Congress and only take effect if both Houses of Congress do not adopt a concurrent resolution of disapproval within a specified period. Sets forth procedures and other provisions relating to such resolutions."
