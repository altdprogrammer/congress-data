Lengthens the period during which the President may amend or withdraw a reorganization plan submitted to Congress. Lengthens the period within which the Committee on Government Operations of the House or the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate must report a resolution approving the plan or be discharged from consideration thereof. Directs the President to include with each reorganization plan transmitted to Congress: (1) a draft of any Executive order, Presidential directive, or other administrative action required in such reorganization; until evidence that preliminary planning to achieve effective implementation of the reorganization has taken place. States that a reorganization plan may not rename an existing Executive department or create an independent agency. Revises the procedure for the Congressional veto of a reorganization plan. Declares that such a plan shall be effective if: (1) each House of Congress adopts a resolution approving the plan within 90 days of continuous session of Congress after the plan is transmitted to Congress; or (2) upon the expiration of such period, unless either House has rejected such a resolution."
