    "text": "Environmental Poisoning Compensation Act - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the \"Superfund Act\") to extend the liability of specified owners, operators, or other responsible persons under such Act to cover any out-of-pocket medical expenses for personal injury resulting from a release of hazardous substances. Excludes liability for such medical expenses from the limitations on the amounts of liability set forth in such Act. Provides that such claims for medical expenses may be asserted against the Hazardous Substance Response Fund. Includes damages for personal injury under the definition of damages. Lowers (from 85 percent) to 66 2/3 percent the amount of the money credited to the Fund which is to be available only for certain purposes relating to governmental and other persons' response costs and to other specified governmental costs. Raises (from $1,380,000,000) to $3,000,000,000 the sum of the amounts received in the Fund which must be reached for the authority to collect environmental taxes (on petroleum and certain chemicals) to be terminated before September 30, 1985."
