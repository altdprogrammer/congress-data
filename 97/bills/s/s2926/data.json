Requires the Commission to develop a National Public Improvements Plan listing in priority order maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of public improvements which will be necessary in each region, to sustain regionally balanced national economic development. Requires the Commission, as a part of the plan, to suggest specific revisions in Federal laws, regulations, and policies that may be necessary to reverse the pattern of disinvestment in national public improvements. Sets forth procedures for the submission of such plan to Congress and for review and implementation of the plan. Establishes the National Commission on the Rebuilding of America to assess the condition of the national public works infrastructure. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
