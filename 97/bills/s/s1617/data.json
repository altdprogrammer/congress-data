Subjects all imported agricultural products to the same inspection standards that are applied to domestic products. Prohibits the entry of imported products that do not meet such standards or such products that have been treated with unapproved agricultural chemicals, animal drugs, or medicated feeds. Requires the Secretary to prescribe assessments and fees on imported meat food products to cover examination, inspection, and labeling costs as determined necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend or revoke the export privileges of any meat exporter who fails to pay such assessments. Title II: Requirement that Eating Establishments Inform Customers That Imported Meat or Meat Food Products are Served in Such Establishments - Requires eating establishments that serve imported meat to inform their customers of that fact. Sets forth penalties for owners, employees, or agents thereof who knowingly violate such requirement."
