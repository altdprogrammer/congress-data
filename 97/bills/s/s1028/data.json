    "text": "Preventive Health Services Block Grant Act of 1981 - Amends title III (General Powers and Duties of the Public Health Service) of the Public Health Service Act to replace the current grant programs for health planning and public health services, preventive health services, paint poisoning, and venereal disease with a Preventive Health Block Grant program. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1985. Sets forth the allotment formula and application requirements. Authorizes the use of such funds for: (1) hypertension control; (2) health incentive activities; (3) risk reduction and health education; (4) venereal disease; (5) fluoridation; (6) rat control; (7) family planning; and (8) adolescent health services. States that such funds do not have to be used to provide services in the same manner as provided prior to October 1, 1981. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide technical assistance to the States. Prohibits the use of funds for: (1) cash payments to health services recipients; (2) construction or land purchase; and (3) satisfying non-Federal funding requirements. Authorizes any State to transfer up to five percent of block grant funds for use under other Federal law providing for health or social services or for meeting home energy and emergency assistance needs. Requires States to report and to prepare an audit at least every two years on activities under this Act.
