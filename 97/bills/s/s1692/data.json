    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Environment and Public Works with amendment, S. Rept. 97-301) National Harbors Improvement and Maintenance Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, to maintain the deep-draft channels and harbors of the United States to specified depths and widths. Prohibits the Secretary, after October 1, 1982, from expending funds for such maintenance until an appropriate non-Federal interest contracts with the Secretary to pay for specified portions thereof. Sets forth procedures by which the Secretary shall be reimbursed for such maintenance and operation costs. Makes the Secretary responsible for the cost of maintaining: (1) the connecting channels between the Great Lakes; and (2) deep-draft channels and harbors that were authorized to serve as harbors of refuge and which lack significant commercial waterway transportation. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President and to Congress on national harbor maintenance needs for the succeeding fiscal year. Declares that this Act shall not prohibit Federal expenditures for emergency flood preparations, flood fighting, or repairs to deep-draft channels and harbors necessitated by a natural disaster. Allows a non-Federal interest to be granted a waiver from certain contractual requirements of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983 through 1987. Authorizes such non-Federal interest to undertake navigation improvements subject to required permits. Directs such non-Federal interest to pay 50 percent of the costs of any necessary relocation and alteration of existing pipelines, cables, and related facilities. Requires that such non-Federal interest repay the United States, within 50 years of the date of enactment, the cost of all channel and harbor construction projects undertaken after September 30, 1982. Declares that this Act shall not prohibit or interfere with national defense transportation requirements. Permits any appropriate non-Federal interest to recover its reimbursement obligation by collecting fees from specified vessels engaged in commercial waterway transportation. Sets forth procedures concerning the joint processing of all Federal permits required for such construction activities. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress in regard to such permit schedules."
