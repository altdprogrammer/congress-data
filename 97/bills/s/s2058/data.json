    "text": "Trade in Services Act of 1982 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require that principal U.S. negotiating objectives in trade agreement negotiations shall be to: (1) reduce barriers to U.S. service sector trade in foreign markets; (2) modify practices which distort international trade in services; and (3) develop internationally agreed rules that are consistent with U.S. commercial policies and that will help ensure open international trade in services. Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to pay particular attention to the interests of the States and consult regularly with representatives of the States in negotiations concerning barriers to international trade in services. Prohibits the USTR from entering negotiations involving a service sector regulated by the States unless the USTR has developed negotiating objectives with representatives of the States. Requires the USTR to inform the service sector advisory committees established by the Trade Act of 1974 of prospective trade negotiations to reduce trade barriers. Requires the USTR to develop negotiating objectives with such committees before entering the negotiations and to consult with the committees during the negotiations. Requires the USTR to consult with interested congressional committees on such negotiations. Requires the USTR to present a proposed negotiating program and an analysis of U.S. negotiating interests to such congressional committees within 45 days after enactment of this Act. Authorizes the President to impose duties or other import restrictions on suppliers of services in order to respond to unfair foreign trade practices. Requires the USTR, before the President imposes such duties or import restrictions, to consult with Federal and State agencies that regulate the services involved. Directs the USTR to coordinate U.S. policies concerning trade in services. Requires Federal agencies regulating service sector industries to notify the USTR and seek the advice of the USTR on certain pending matters relating to international trade in services. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to establish in the Department of Commerce a service industries development program. Sets forth the purposes of such program. Directs the USTR and the Secretary to advise State governments on U.S. policies on international trade in services. Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. authorities responsible for regulating a service sector should, in developing their market access policies, consider the extent to which U.S. suppliers are accorded access to foreign markets. Requires Federal agencies regulating a service sector, when considering a rule that may affect the access of a foreign supplier to the U.S. market, to: (1) consider information concerning the market access accorded U.S. suppliers in the home market of the foreign suppliers that may be affected; and (2) indicate the extent to which any action taken with regard to such rule promotes fairness in international trade. Authorizes such agencies to impose such restrictions on foreign access to the U.S. market for such service sector as may be appropriate to promote fairness in international service sector trade. Authorizes appropriations."
