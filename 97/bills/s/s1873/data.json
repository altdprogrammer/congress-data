    "text": "Florida Wilderness Act of 1982 - Designates the following lands in Florida as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Bradwell Bay Wilderness Addition in the Apalachicola National Forest; (2) the Mud Swamp/New River Wilderness in the Apalachicola National Forest; (3) the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness in the Osceola National Forest; (4) the Alexander Springs Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (5) the Juniper Prairie Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; (6) the Little Lake George Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest; and (7) the Billies Bay Wilderness in the Ocala National Forest. Prohibits the Department of the Interior from issuing phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest until there is Federal legislation determining that such leases are necessary in the national interest. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to determine if specified phosphate preference right lease applicants have discovered valuable deposits of phosphate. Requires the Secretary to determine, within one year of enactment of this Act, the fair market value of phosphate leases which would be issued to such lease applicants absent the leasing ban under this Act. Directs the Secretary to acquire any valuable phosphate lease rights from such lease applicants within three years after enactment of this Act. Provides that the designation of the Big Gum Swamp Wilderness will not alter phosphate lease rights applicable to lands within the wilderness. Allows waivers of the time deadlines under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
