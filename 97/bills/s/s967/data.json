Makes such Fund available to the Commodity Credit Corporation to finance commercial export credit sales of U.S. agricultural commodities out of private stocks provided the Corporation uses the Fund to finance sales that will develop new markets or expand existing markets. Limits the Fund's annual export credit sales obligations to the amount of money in the Fund for such purpose less a reasonable contingency reserve. Lists the sources of the money to be credited to the Fund. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to Congress on the operation of such Fund."
