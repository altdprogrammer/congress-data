Requires: (1) tests to be conducted on any imported meat food product to determine if such product contains any prohibited substance; and (2) an appropriate government official of the country of origin to certify that such product has been tested in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary to conduct a program under which Department of Agriculture inspectors send samples of meat products intended for export to the United States for testing. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe fees on imported meat food products to cover the costs of such inspections, testing, and labeling required by this Act. Grants the Secretary the authority to suspend the privilege of any exporter of such products who fails to pay assessed fees. Title II: Requirement of Certain Eating Establishments to Inform Customers That Imported Meat or Meat Food Products Are Served in Such Establishments - Requires any eating establishment serving imported meat to inform customers of such fact. Sets forth penalties for any owner, employee, or agent thereof who knowingly violates such requirement."
