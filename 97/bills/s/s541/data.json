    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act, with regard to State implementation plans for a national primary ambient air quality standard, to authorize the President, as well as a Governor, to issue a temporary emergency suspension of any part of such plan applicable to a fuel burning stationary source. Requires either the President or the Governor to issue such an emergency suspension if either finds that foreign imports of fuels used by such source have reached an excessive level and that such imports can be reduced by the emergency suspension. Requires such suspension to be effective for a maximum of five years, or longer if reasonable; except suspensions violating a national ambient air quality standard are limited to not more than four months. Allows the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in a disapproval order to require a lesser period if the suspension is issued by a Governor. Allows for revocation of a suspension if after four months the fuel burning stationary source in question has not changed to an alternate fuel."
