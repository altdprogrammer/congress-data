    "text": "Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exempt from minimum wage and overtime coverage employees principally engaged in the production of livestock on the range away from the headquarters of the employer, without regard to the difficulty of computing the hours worked. Eliminates provisions which made the minimum wage exemption inapplicable to agricultural employees of specified establishments. Exempts from minimum wage coverage employees above age 12 and below age 17 who are employed in the range production of livestock: (1) within their school district or on the same farm or ranch where their parent is also employed; and (2) for not more than 16 hours per week outside of school hours during school sessions or 40 hours per week during vacation periods. Allows such exemption only if such employee's occupation has not been declared to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children below age 16."
