    "text": "International Communication Agency Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1983 - Authorizes FY 1983 appropriations for the International Communication Agency (ICA) to carry out international communication, education, cultural, and exchange programs. Earmarks specified amounts for: (1) the Education and Cultural Affairs Directorate of the ICA; (2) the Fullbright Academic Exchange Programs and the International Visitor Program; (3) the Humphrey Fellowship Program; and (4) grants to private, nonprofit organizations engaging in exchange-of-persons programs. Amends the United States Information and Education Exchange Act of 1948 to authorize the ICA to credit to its applicable appropriations any fees received by the ICA in connection with its English-teaching programs. Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to direct the President to prescribe the salary rates for each salary class of the Senior Foreign Service. Directs the Secretary of State to determine which of the basic salary rates shall be paid to each member of a salary class. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust the basic salary rate of a member of the Senior Foreign Service once a year. (Current law requires Presidential reappointment and Senate reconfirmation for a senior foreign service member to move, even within a class, from one pay level to another.)"
