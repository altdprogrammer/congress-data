    "text": "Food Stamp Reform Act of 1982 - Title I: Definitions - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to require that related persons (currently parents and children) who live together be treated as a food stamp household, unless one of the individuals is 60 years of age or over or receiving supplemental security income benefits or disability payments under the Social Security Act. Revises the method of adjusting the thrifty food plan for FY 1982 through 1984. Title II: Eligible Households - Revises the income standards of eligibility to require households without an elderly or disabled member to meet a 100 percent poverty net income test and a 130 percent poverty gross income test. Changes the date for adjustments of standard deductions in computing household income for 1983 from July 1 to October 1. Allows State agencies to use a standard utility allowance in computing the excess shelter expense deduction. Includes any savings and retirement accounts and the cash value of pensions as financial resources in determining household eligibility. Establishes categorical eligibility for households in which all members are Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients. Title III: Eligibility Disqualifications - Declares that during a period of a person's ineligibility the financial resources of that person shall be included as income for that person's household. Authorizes the Secretary to permit State agencies to establish periodic reporting requirements similar to such requirements under the AFDC program of the Social Security Act. Grants State agencies the option of requiring job search information at the time of an individual's application for food stamps. Increases from 60 days to 90 days the period of ineligibility for the head of a household who voluntarily quits employment. Requires that a second parent in a household register for work when the youngest child reaches the age of twelve. Title IV: Value of Allotment - Prohibits State agencies from issuing an allotment for the initial month or period if such allotment is less than a specified amount. Prohibits a household from receiving increased allotments as a result of being penalized for noncompliance with other public assistance programs. Title V: Administration - Directs State agencies to provide expedited coupon issuance to destitute migrant or seasonal farmworker households and to other households based on gross income and financial resources. Authorizes a State agency to immediately reduce or terminate benefits in any household for which the agency has received written information from such household which requires a reduction or termination. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to conduct verification measures to assure that individuals are not receiving duplicative benefits under the food stamp program. Authorizes the Secretary to require State agencies to implement new or modified procedures to improve program integrity and be cost-effective. Title VI: Collection and Disposition of Claims - Grants households determined ineligible because of fraud and misrepresentation 30 days in which to select a repayment plan before such household is subject to an allotment reduction. Sets forth procedures for a State agency to intercept unemployment benefits of food stamp recipients who have received overpayments and such overpayments are uncollected. Title VII: Administrative Cost-Sharing and Quality Controls - Permits States to retain 50 percent of overissuances which are recovered. Directs the Secretary to institute an error rate reduction program under which a State agency's federally funded share of administrative costs may be lowered if such agency's payment errors exceed certain percentages. Title VIII: Authorization for Appropriations - Extends authorization for the food stamp program through FY 1985. Authorizes appropriations for the Puerto Rico block grant for FY 1983 through 1985. Title IX: Miscellaneous - Requires the rounding down to the nearest whole dollar in calculations for the thrifty food plan, household allotments, and household income deductions. Title X: Effective Dates - Makes this Act effective upon enactment."
