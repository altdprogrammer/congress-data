Specifies the method of computing the average indexed monthly earnings of a blind individual for purposes of determining such individual's primary insurance amount. Provides that the benefits of a blind person shall not be reduced because of such person's refusal to accept State-approved rehabilitative services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. Requires recomputation of the disability insurance benefit of a blind individual who applies for a recomputation if it would result in a higher primary insurance amount."
