Repeals the requirement that the annual report on such operations be submitted to Congress. Amends the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act of 1945 to transfer the functions of the National Capital Planning Commission (Commission) to the Mayor. Requires the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency to report annually to the Mayor rather than to Congress. Amends the District of Columbia Code to delete the authority of the Commission relating to certain highways. Amends the D.C. Code provisions authorizing the sale of certain District real estate to eliminate the authority of the Commission to approve such sales and to transfer authority over such sales to either the Mayor or the Council of the District of Columbia. Amends the D.C. Code provisions relating to certain exchanges of District lands for abutting land to transfer authority over such exchanges to the Mayor. Amends the D.C. Code provisions relating to harbor regulations to limit the authority to regulate D.C. waterfronts to the District of Columbia."
