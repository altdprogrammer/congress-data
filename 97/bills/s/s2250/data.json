    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1982-06-09", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Disaster Relief Act Amendments of 1982 - Amends the short title of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to read the \"Major Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\" Amends such Act to redefine \"emergency\" to include any instance for which, in the President's determination, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts to save lives and protect property. Repeals provisions of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 concerning economic recovery for disaster areas. Amends the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to revise procedures concerning State requests for emergency assistance. Authorizes the President to: (1) direct Federal agencies to utilize their resources in support of State and local emergency assistance; and (2) provide emergency assistance to save lives and protect property and public health. Limits expenditures for such emergency assistance to a specified sum. Allows the President to exceed such sum under certain circumstances. Limits assistance to relief from natural disasters (excluding social or economic catastrophes). Revises provisions concerning Federal and State disaster preparedness programs. Increases amounts available for grants for State disaster assistance plans. Authorizes appropriations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency through FY 1983. Makes the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency the Federal coordinating officer in a major disaster area. Directs the President to deny disaster assistance to the extent that damage for which assistance is requested could have been compensated by reasonably available, adequate and necessary flood insurance. Excludes Federal, State, and local disaster assistance from individuals' income when determining eligibility for federally funded income assistance. Requires the Director to report to the Senate and House public works committees on each major disaster or emergency that he has declared. Declares that action taken or assistance provided pursuant to such Act that restores facilities substantially as they existed before the disaster shall not be deemed a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Authorizes the Attorney General to institute actions against any party whose acts or omissions may have caused or contributed to the events resulting in a Presidential declaration of emergency or disaster. Makes such party liable to the United States for the full amount of Federal expenditures for damage caused by such acts or omissions. Directs the Director to conduct audits and investigations to assure compliance with the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for violations of such Act. Limits the Federal share of disaster assistance available for repairs and reconstruction of public facilities and private nonprofit facilities and debris removal to 75% of eligible costs. Revises provisions concerning temporary housing assistance for those displaced by a major disaster or emergency. Adjusts the rental to be charged to occupants of temporary housing who require such housing as a result of a major disaster. Reduces the duration of unemployment assistance to individuals unemployed as a result of a major disaster. Permits a State to be reimbursed for certain expenses incurred in administering grants to individuals and families. Deletes provisions concerning timber sale contracts. Authorizes appropriations for the purposes of such Act for fiscal years 1983, 1984, and 1985. Makes this Act effective 60 days after enactment, except for major disasters and emergencies declared by the President prior to such date."
