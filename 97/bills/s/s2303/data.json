(Currently, the importation of such foreign excess property is prohibited, regardless of where the property was manufactured, unless the Secretary of Commerce (or the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to agricultural commodities) determines that it would relieve domestic shortages or otherwise benefit the U.S. economy.) Exempts property that is imported or certified to be reexported by a Federal agency. Declares that a violation of such prohibition may result in the suspension of authority to import such property for not more than three years."
