Directs the Chief of Engineers to mitigate fish and wildlife habitat losses resulting from such construction by purchasing, at Federal expense, specified land. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer such land to the State of West Virginia for operation and maintenance. Requires the Chief of Engineers to submit a final environmental impact statement to Congress prior to initiating such construction. Provides for veto of such impact statement by concurrent resolution of Congress within 60 days. Exempts such impact statement and actions to carry out such project from judicial review except as specified. Sets forth procedures for such expedited judicial review. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Chief of Engineers, pending appropriation of such sums, to allot, from existing Army Department civil works appropriations, such sums as are necessary for immediate improvements."
