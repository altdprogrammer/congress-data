    "text": "Ancient Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1982 - Ratifies the transfers of land or natural resources, within the States of New York or South Carolina, which were made on behalf of an Indian Tribe before January 1, 1912. Extinguishes, by virtue of ratification, related claims against such transfers. Exempts specified land in New York from ratification. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting information from such Indian tribes about outstanding claims. Directs the Secretary, within 180 days of such submission, to determine: (1) the credibility of such claims; and (2) the amount of fair compensation due credible claims. Prohibits judicial review of such determination. Requires such Indian tribes to accept or reject the Secretary's determination within 60 days. States that such determination shall be binding if it is accepted. Authorizes the Secretary to assist such Indian tribes receiving compensation to purchase other lands or natural resources. Authorizes such Indian tribes to file a cause of action in the Court of Claims, against the United States, for compensation arising out of land transfer claims which have not been settled or determined by the Secretary. Gives the Court of Claims exclusive jurisdiction over such cases. Sets out: (1) criteria for determining entitlement to a recovery against the United States; and (2) procedures for determining and paying the amount of such recovery. Limits recovery due certain claims arising after July 22, 1790. Assigns docket priority to claims brought under this Act before the Court of Claims. Authorizes appropriations. Requires any contest of the constitutionality or validity of this Act to be brought in certain Federal district courts within a specified time."
