Extends the residential energy credit to lessors of dwelling units. Reduces the amount of the credit which is allowed to lessors who take the depreciation deduction. Increases, for purposes of such credit, the allowable energy conservation and renewable energy source expenditures. Extends through 1985 the period for which the general energy percentage, for purposes of the investment tax credit, is applicable."
