Directs the Administrator to: (1) submit to Congress, within 180 days after enactment of this Act a report identifying projects which serve the purpose of the program; (2) consult with representatives of State and local environmental agencies concernign ways to implement this Act; and (3) utilize the talents of older Americans available for project participation and consult with the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the Administration on Aging to ensure coordination with similar projects under the Older Americans Act of 1965 or the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (or under any successor statute). Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to and cooperative agreements with, public and private institutions and individuals to carry out the program under this Act.
