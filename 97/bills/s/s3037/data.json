    "text": "Agricultural Produce Bailment Bankruptcy Amendments Act of 1982 - Amends the Bankruptcy Act to require bankruptcy courts to give priority to allowed unsecured claims of farmers arising from the sale or conversion of farm produce to or by a debtor who operates a farm produce storage facility. Specifies that such sale or conversion must have occurred within 180 days before the filing of the petition or before the cessation of the debtor's business, whichever occurs first. Limits the payment of any such claim to $2,000 per individual. Permits a bankruptcy court to expedite the procedures for determining interests in and the disposition of grain and proceeds held by debtors who own or operate grain storage facilities. Requires the court to expedite such procedures if requested by a trustee or a claimant. Sets forth factors for the court to consider before deciding whether to shorten the time periods for procedures. Lists the procedures which may be expedited. Specifies administrative details."
