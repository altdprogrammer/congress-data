    "text": "(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs with amendment, H. Rept. 97-926) Revises the boundaries of the Saratoga National Historical Park in New York. Prohibits the acquisition of lands or property interests within the park without the owner's consent unless: (1) the Secretary of the Interior finds that the owner is or will be significantly degrading the value of such land; or (2) the owner fails to grant the Secretary the right of first refusal when the owner intends to transfer any interest in such lands to persons other than the owner's immediate family. Requires immediate notification to the owner of any such determination with respect to the owner's actions. Requires the Secretary to attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution if the owner immediately ceases his or her activities upon such notification. Provides that if the owner intends to transfer an interest in lands within the park to persons other than the owner's immediate family, the owner must give the Secretary the right of first refusal by written notification. Requires the Secretary to respond in 45 days and to exercise such right within 90 days after such response, or the owner may proceed with the transfer. Removes a specified tract of land from the acquisition provisions above. Provides that an owner of property within the park must obtain a written determination from the Secretary as to whether a planned action by the owner is compatible with the purposes of the park. Requires the Secretary to issue the owner a certificate of exemption from condemnation for such action if such action is found to be compatible with those purposes. Permits an owner of improved property within the park to retain a right of use and occupancy of the property for residential or agricultural purposes. Makes such rights inapplicable with respect to property necessary for administration, development, access, or public use. Provides that owners of property within the park may notify the Secretary of their desire to sell such property. Requires the Secretary to endeavor to acquire such property within six months of the notice at fair market value and subject to the Secretary's conditions. Amends Federal law establishing the Saratoga National Historical Park to: (1) repeal the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to accept donations of additional lands, buildings, or other property in Saratoga County; and (2) remove the acreage limitation on the Park. Authorizes appropriations after October 1, 1983, to carry out this Act. Limits the authorization of appropriations for land acquisition to $1,000,000."
