    "text": "Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1981 - Title I: Improved Identification for Motor Vehicle Parts and Components - Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to direct the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate a Federal motor vehicle security standard. Directs the Secretary to conduct a cost-benefit analysis before promulgating such standard, which includes the effect on domestic motor vehicle production and sales. Stipulates that the standard shall not: (1) impose additional costs upon manufacturers in excess of $10 per motor vehicle; and (2) require the identification of more than 14 parts for any motor vehicle, nine parts for any truck, and four parts for any trailer. Declares that a Federal motor vehicle standard supersedes any State or local standard. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct studies on the development of security devices and systems. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on such devices and systems within one year of enactment. Provides for repeal of this title on a specified date. Title II: Antifencing Measures - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for removing or altering any identification number for any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part required by regulation. Requires the forfeiture of any vehicle or part which has had such number removed, with specified exceptions. Applies to the seizure and forfeiture of motor vehicles and parts those provisions of law relating to the seizure and forfeiture of vessels and merchandise under the customs laws. Establishes penalties for anyone who buys, receives, possesses, or obtains control of, with intent to sell or otherwise dispose of, any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part knowing that such identification number has been removed or altered. Designates as nonmailable matter any manipulative type device which is designed or adapted to operate, circumvent, remove, or render inoperative the ignition switch or lock, or door or trunk lock of two or more motor vehicles, or any advertisement offering the sale of such device. Title III: Importation and Exportation Measures - Establishes criminal and civil penalties for anyone who imports, exports, or attempts to import or export any self-propelled vehicle or vehicle part knowing that its identification number has been altered. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require persons who export or attempt to export a used self-propelled vehicle to present to the appropriate customs officers the vehicle and a document describing that vehicle. Title IV: Reporting Requirements - Directs the Attorney General to establish a task force to study problems relating to the theft of off-highway mobile equipment. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a task force to study problems relating to motor vehicle titling and controls over motor vehicle salvage which may affect the motor vehicle theft problem. Directs the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Transportation and the Postmaster General, to report to Congress on the implementation of this Act."
