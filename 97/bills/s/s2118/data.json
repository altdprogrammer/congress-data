    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1982-12-16", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Wyoming Wilderness Act of 1982 - Title I: Short Title, Findings and Purposes - Sets forth the short title, findings, and purposes of this Act. Title II: Additions to National Wilderness Preservation System - Designates the following lands in Wyoming as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) the Cloud Peak Wilderness in the Bighorn National Forest; (2) the Popo Agie Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest; (3) the Gros Ventre Wilderness in the Bridger-Teton National Forest; (4) the Jedediah Smith Wilderness in the Targhee National Forest; (5) the Laramie Peak Wilderness in the Medicine Bow National Forest; (6) the DuNoir Addition to the Washakie Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest; (7) the Corridor Addition to the Teton Wilderness in the Bridger-Teton National Forest; and (8) the Glacier Addition to the Fitzpatrick Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest. Prohibits the use of roads constructed within the special management unit of the Washakie Wilderness for general public travel. Repeals the prohibition on the use of existing roads in such unit for harvesting timber and on the construction and expansion of roads in such unit. Provides that motorized access for the trapping, transportation, and management of the big horn sheep population in the Glacier Addition of the Fitzpatrick Wilderness shall be allowed. Abolishes the previous classification of the Whiskey Mountain Primitive Area. Title III: Release of Lands for Multiple Use Management - States that the RARE II final environmental impact statement (dated January 1979) shall not be subject to judicial review with respect to national forest system lands in Wyoming. Requires that national forest system lands in Wyoming not designated as additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System by this Act or by previous legislation be managed for multiple uses other than wilderness. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Wyoming to determine their suitability as wilderness without express congressional authorization. Title IV: Withdrawal of Designated Wilderness Areas from Operation of the Mining and Mineral Leasing Laws - Withdraws designated wilderness areas in Wyoming from appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Title V: Assessment of Minerals, Prohibition on Drilling - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to continue to assess the minerals potential of wilderness lands in Wyoming. Prohibits exploratory drilling to assess oil and gas potential within any congressionally designated wilderness area in Wyoming. Authorizes the President to make recommendations to Congress that minerals development, exploration, or extraction not previously permitted be permitted in specified areas within any of Wyoming's wilderness areas. Sets forth the recommendation process. Makes such a recommendation effective only upon enactment of a joint resolution by Congress approving the recommendation. Title VI: Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to review Department of Agriculture policies and practices regarding livestock grazing in Wyoming's wilderness areas to ensure their compliance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. States that: (1) nothing in this Act shall constitute a claim or denial by the Federal Government as to exemption from Wyoming water laws; and (2) nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting Wyoming's jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in the national forests in the State. States that it is not Congress' intention that the designation of wilderness areas in Wyoming lead to the creation of buffer zones around each such area."
