    "text": "National Driver Register Act of 1981 - Eliminates the register in the Department of Commerce that lists the names of persons who have had their motor vehicle operator's licenses revoked. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish and maintain a National Driver Register to assist chief driver licensing officials of participating States in exchanging information regarding the motor vehicle driving records of individuals. Prohibits the Secretary from maintaining information in such Register for more than a seven-year period from the date of its entry. Allows any State to participate in such Register system. Directs the chief driver licensing official of a participating State to transmit specified information on certain drivers to the Secretary. Allows access to such information to specified individuals, including the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Limits the use of such information to official investigations and statistical research. Sets forth criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of information from the National Driver Register. Establishes a National Driver Register Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of the Register system. Directs the Committee to report at least annually to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary, within nine years of the date of enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the level of State participation in and the effectiveness of the Register system. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal years 1981 through 1990."
