Eliminates the administrative preclearance with the Department of Justice. Permits a State or local government to apply for a declaratory judgment for preclearance to its local Federal district court (currently, such actions are limited to the District Court for the District of Columbia). Provides that such an action shall name the United States as defendant, with process served upon the Attorney General. Permits enforcement of an electoral change 60 days after submission of the information to the court if neither the United States nor an interested person has raised objections. Permits persons interested in the enforcement of voting rights to submit their names and addresses to a registry maintained by the district court. Requires a preclearance action to be served on all interested persons to the extent practicable. Permits any resident or organization carrying on activities in a State or local government seeking preclearance to intervene in the action as a matter of right. Provides for expedited judicial process for any preclearance action."
