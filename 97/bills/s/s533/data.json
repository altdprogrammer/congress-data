    "date": "1981-05-06", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #90 (93-0)) Public Buildings Act of 1981 - Title I: General Authorities - Gives the Administrator of General Services (GSA), acting through the Public Buildings Service, sole authority to acquire, design, construct, lease, manage, maintain, repair, renovate, and assign space in public buildings. Establishes in GSA a Public Buildings Service to be headed by a Commissioner of Public Buildings. Creates the position of Supervising Architect to supervise all design activities of the Public Buildings Service. Permits the Administrator to delegate to an agency head any of the aforementioned authorities in regard to the public buildings needs of such agency. Requires the Administrator annually to report to Congress concerning activities undertaken to meet the public buildings needs of Federal agencies. Specifies lists to be included in such report. Requires the Administrator to maintain specified information in order to keep Congress fully informed. Directs the Administrator to require, prior to executing any lease or other contract which would obligate funds in excess of $10,000 authorized pursuant to this Act, a certification from the owner of the space to be leased or the contractor. Requires such certification to include statements and declarations that such owner or contractor, or any of his officers or principal employees: (1) has no business or employment relationship or interest or holding which constitutes a conflict of interest; (2) has not offered or promised anything of value to a public official with the intent to influence any official act or to induce the official to perform any act in violation of his lawful duties; (3) has not been debarred or suspended from the award of public contracts; (4) has not had a public contract terminated for default; and (5) has not been convicted, within ten years prior to the date of the solicitation, of, or is not currently under indictment for or otherwise charged with, specified offenses. Makes the Administrator responsible for the interpretation of all contracts entered into to carry out this Act. Authorizes the Administrator to conduct research and post-occupancy evaluation to determine and improve the effectiveness of existing and planned public buildings in providing accommodations for Federal agency offices. Repeals the Public Buildings Act of 1959. Title II: Locations for Federal Agency Offices - Requires the headquarters offices of each Federal agency to be located in the National Capital region. Requires regional, district, area, or local Federal agency offices to be centrally located or within easy transportation access of the populations they serve or other offices with which they must maintain frequent communication.
