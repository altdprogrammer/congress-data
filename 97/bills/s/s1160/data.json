Authorizes the Secretary to make capital grants to States and local public bodies for repair or replacement of public transportation equipment and facilities damaged by natural disaster or catastrophic occurrence. Sets forth conditions for approval of such grants. Authorizes appropriations for formula grants for fiscal years 1981 through 1984 for: (1) urban mass transit; (2) construction or operating assistance; (3) commuter rail and fixed guideway systems; and, for fiscal years 1982 through 1986, (4) the purchase of buses and related equipment or the construction of bus-related facilities; and (5) areas other than urbanized areas. Authorizes a Governor to transfer part of a specified apportionment made to his or her State to supplement funds apportioned to the State for areas other than urbanized areas. Requires that such amounts so transferred be utilized for construction projects.

Directs the Secretary to report to Congress within three years after the date of enactment of this Act on the service being provided by apportionment recipients to handicapped persons. Prohibits sums apportioned by the Secretary after September 30, 1982, for formula grants for areas other than urbanized areas from being used for operating expenses or costs incurred under purchase of service agreements.
