Repeals various Federal laws authorizing categorical grants and other assistance in such areas. Prohibits the block grants from being used for inpatient services, cash payments, improvement of land or facilities, or as satisfaction for any non-Federal match. Authorizes any State to transfer up to ten percent of block grant funds for use under other Federal law providing for health promotion and disease prevention or social services, or for meeting home energy and emergency assistance needs. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes $1,137,600,000 for each of fiscal years 1982 through 1985 to carry out this Act."
