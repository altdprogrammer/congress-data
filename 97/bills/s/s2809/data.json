    "text": "National Science and Technology Improvement Act of 1982 - Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a presidential program for the improvement of science and technology, to be administered by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (Office). Directs the Office to assess particular problems of science and engineering manpower, including teacher shortages, and retraining of workers. Requires the Office to submit these assessments to the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation before the presidential budget submission for FY 1984. Establishes a Federal program for university research facilities and science and technical manpower improvement to upgrade academic research for the physical and biological sciences. Authorizes specified Federal agencies to make grants. Directs the Office to establish guidelines for agency participation. Requires the Director to submit such guidelines to the aforementioned committees before such budget submission. Requires the Director to report at least annually to such committees. Terminates such program after five years. Establishes within the Executive Office the presidential science and engineering young investigators awards program to encourage young scientists at the university level to pursue careers in academic research. Requires that the program be administered by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Requires the Director of the Office to select recipients from among untenured faculty members in mathematics, the physical or biological sciences, or engineering at universities with established doctoral research programs. States that such an award shall consist of a base research support grant of $25,000 per year for five years. Permits the Director to make an additional award for five years which requires the matching of the Federal share on a two for one basis, up to a $75,000 annual total. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983-1987. Establishes within the Executive Office a presidential science and mathematics improvement program to improve the skills of precollege science and math teachers. Requires the coordination of this program with each State. Provides stipends for eligible teachers. Requires State and local school authorities to nominate participants to be selected by the Director. Requires half the stipend money to come from non-Federal sources. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983-1987."
