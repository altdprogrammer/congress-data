Provides that any relative refusing to work, without good cause, would be excluded from calculations made to determine the size of the family's payment. Excludes from the work requirement, among others: (1) a relative who already participates in a work incentive program; (2) a child under age 18; and (3) a mother with a child under six years of age."
