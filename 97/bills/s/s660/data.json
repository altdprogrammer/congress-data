Provides that a participating State, instead of receiving payments as presently provided under parts A and E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of the Act, shall receive payments under the program. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and evaluation of the block grant program and to report to Congress concerning such study and evaluation."
