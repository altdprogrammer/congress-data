    "date": "1982-06-30", 
    "text": "Amends the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to repeal provisions: (1) prohibiting the issuance of a lease to any entity which has held a coal lease for at least ten years and which is not producing coal in commercial quantities under such lease; and (2) requiring diligent development of a logical mining unit such that the coal reserves of the entire unit must be mined within a period not to exceed 40 years. Permits a lessee to dedicate any lease to the production of synthetic fuel, upon application to the Secretary of the Interior. Extends the period for achieving production in commercial quantities for such a lease to 15 years. Directs the Secretary, unless the public interest will not be served, to suspend upon the payment of advance royalties: (1) the condition of continued operation; (2) the requirement of production in commercial quantities; or (3) any diligent development requirement. (Current law authorizes the Secretary to suspend the condition of continued operation if the Secretary determines that it will serve the public interest.) Directs the Secretary to exempt coking coal from the requirements of diligent development and continued operation. States that such exemption shall be applicable upon a showing that coking coal deposits are dedicated to the support of steelmaking facilities."
