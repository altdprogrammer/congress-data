Directs such common carriers by water to file their tariffs with the Federal Maritime Commission within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Sets forth the effective dates of such tariffs. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) require such common carriers by water to reveal, in tariffs filed with the Commission, the portion of such tariffs attributable to inland transportation; (2) require such common carriers to reveal any information with regard to such inland transportation; or (3) extend to the Commission any jurisdiction over or authority to regulate rail carriers."
