    "text": "Public Lands Conservation, Rehabilitation, and Improvement Act of 1981 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to establish and administer a public lands conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement program. Requires the Secretary to provide assistance to program agencies (any Federal or State agency responsible for the management of public lands) to establish and operate residential and nonresidential conservation centers to implement program projects. Describes the types of projects which will receive program preference. Limits program projects to those benefitting public or Indian lands, except where projects on nonpublic lands benefit associated public or Indian lands or provide significant public benefits. Sets forth requirements for establishing conservation centers and eligibility criteria for enrollees in the program. Makes persons eligible for enrollment and employment in the program if they are: (1) unemployed; (2) between the ages of 16 and 25 years; and (3) citizens, lawful permanent residents, or lawfully admitted alien parolees or refugees. Provides that in the selection of enrollees for the program, preference shall be given to economically, socially, physically, and educationally disadvantaged youth and youth residing in areas having substantial unemployment. Requires program agencies to provide services, facilities, supplies, and equipment for conservation centers as the Secretary deems necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to, or enter into agreements with, program agencies for the funding and operation of conservation centers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1989. Requires such appropriations to be credited from specified Treasury receipts. States that program enrollees shall not be deemed Federal employees, except as provided in specified provisions of law. Makes the Secretary responsible for the pay of enrollees and coordination of the program with related Federal, State, local, and private activities. Directs the Secretary to submit a report to Congress, within one year of enactment of this Act, on the feasibility of allowing enrollees who have completed two years in the program an exemption from training and service under the Military Selective Service Act. Directs the Secretary to make arrangements with educational institutions for the award of academic credit to enrollees for competencies developed under this Act. Authorizes program agencies to make arrangements with such institutions for academic study by enrollees during nonworking hours. Requires program agencies to provide certification of skills acquired by program participants and to provide job guidance and placement information as may be necessary. Directs the Secretary to report to the President and Congress by March 1 of each year on the activities carried out under this Act."
