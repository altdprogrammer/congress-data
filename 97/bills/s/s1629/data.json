    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Broadcast Deregulation Act of 1982 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from regulating the programming of radio broadcast station licensees. Directs the FCC to renew a broadcast station's license if the station has not seriously violated the Communications Act and, with respect to television stations, the licensee has substantially met the needs of residents of its service area. Prohibits the FCC, when acting on a license renewal application, from considering the license application of another person for the same facilities. Directs the FCC, consistent with sound spectrum management, to encourage the introduction of new and additional services. Requires the FCC, in acting upon applications for such services, to presume the services are in the public interest whenever providing them is technically feasible without causing significant technical degradation to or interference with radio transmissions by other licensees. Sets forth a schedule of fees to be charged by the FCC for specified services. Authorizes the FCC to increase or decrease the charges annually. Authorizes the FCC to impose penalty fees and to waive fee payments. Requires the moneys collected from these fees to be placed in the Treasury for use by the FCC. Limits the amount collected from the fees to 50 percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated to the FCC. Directs the FCC to allocate channels for very high frequency (VHF) commercial television broadcasting so that not less than one such channel shall be allocated to each State. Directs the FCC to permit the reallocation of a VHF channel if a licensee offers to move its channel into a State without a VHF channel. Requires the FCC to issue a license of up to five years duration to such licensee for that purpose."
