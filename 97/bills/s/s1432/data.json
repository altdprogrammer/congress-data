    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-06-25", 
    "text": "Straddles Tax Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that any loss from the holding of one or more positions in certain securities shall be recognized, for income tax deduction purposes, only to the extent that it exceeds the unrealized gain (gain which would be recognized if the position had been sold at its fair market value) from the holding of one or more positions which: (1) were acquired before the disposition resulting in the loss; (2) were offsetting positions; and (3) were not part of an identified straddle. Defines \"offsetting position\" to mean that there is a substantial reduction of the taxpayer's risk of loss from holding any position with respect to securities because the taxpayer also holds one or more other positions with respect to such securities (commonly referred to as a \"straddle\"). Creates a rebuttable presumption that two or more positions are offsetting, for purposes of the definition of a straddle, if: (1) they are in the same personal property, although they may be in a substantially altered form; (2) they are in debt instruments of a similar maturity or certain other debt instruments; (3) they are sold or marketed as such; (4) the aggregate margin requirement for such positions is lower than the sum of the margin requirement for each such position; or (5) there are other factors, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to regulations, which indicate that such positions are offsetting. Imposes a penalty upon a taxpayer who fails to report each position held with respect to which there is unrealized gain. Disallows as a deduction, and makes chargeable to capital account, interest and carrying charges with respect to personal property which is part of a straddle. Treats as sold at its fair market value any regulated futures contract held by the taxpayer at the close of the taxable year. Treats gain or loss with respect to such a contact as: (1) short-term capital gain or loss, to the extent of 40 percent of the gain or loss; and (2) long-term capital gain or loss, to the extent of 60 percent of the gain or loss. Exempts from the loss recognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code any straddle consisting entirely of offsetting positions which are regulated futures contracts. Defines \"regulated futures contract\" as a contract: (1) which requires delivery of personal property; (2) with respect to which amounts deposited and withdrawn depend on a system of marking to market; and (3) which is traded on or subject to the rules of certain boards of trade. Exempts from the application of such rules any hedging transaction. Defines \"hedging transaction\" as any transaction: (1) which is entered into in the course of the trade or business primarily to reduce certain types of risk with respect to property or borrowing; and (2) which is clearly identified as such. Limits the three-year carryback of losses from regulated futures contracts to an amount which: (1) does not exceed the lesser of the capital gain net income from regulated futures contracts or all of the capital gain net income; and (2) does not increase or produce a net operating loss. Provides that obligations of the United States, a State or local government, or a U.S. possession issued on a discount basis and payable without interest in less than one year shall be treated as capital assets in determining tax consequences of gain or loss with respect to such obligations. Treats as ordinary income any gain realized from the sale or exchange of short-term government obligations which does not exceed an amount equal to the ratable share of the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity over the taxapayer's basis. Requires dealers in securities to identify securities which they acquire for personal investment purposes on the day such securities are acquired, for purposes of the capital gains tax treatment of such securities. Excludes from capital gains tax treatment gains by a securities dealer from the sale or exchange of any security, unless the security was clearly identified in the dealer's records before the end of the day after the date of acquisition, as a security held for investment (currently, before the end of the 30th day after the date of acquisition)."
