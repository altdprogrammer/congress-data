Permits individuals and school boards to seek relief from court orders made prior to this Act unless the court makes certain findings, including that the acts giving rise to the order intentionally and specifically caused the segregation; that no other remedy would work; and that the benefits of the order outweigh its economic, social, and educational costs."
