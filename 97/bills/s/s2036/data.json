    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-889) Job Training Partnership Act - Sets forth the purposes of this Act: (1) to establish programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force; and (2) to afford job training to economically disadvantaged and other individuals facing serious barriers to employment.

Directs the Governor to approve requests to be an SDA from: (1) any local government with a population of 200,000 or more; (2) any consortium of contiguous local governments with an aggregate population of 200,000 or more, which serves a substantial part of an LMA; and (3) any concentrated employment program grantee for a rural area which served as a prime sponsor under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Provides for appeals to the Secretary of Labor (\"the Secretary\") of denials by the Governor of such requests. Authorizes the Governor to approve SDA requests, without regard to population, from any local government, or consortium of contiguous local governments, which serves a substantial portion of an LMA.

Provides for reconstitution of PICs and modification of plans under such circumstances. Authorizes the Secretary to approve a plan or modification in any case in which the SDA is a State. Provides for nationally established performance standards. Declares that the basic measure of performance for adult training programs under title II (Training Services for the Disadvantaged) is the increase in employment and earnings and the reductions in welfare dependency resulting from participation in the program.

Title II: Training Services for the Disadvantaged - Part A: Adult and Youth Programs - Sets forth formulas for the allocation of amounts appropriated to specified territories and to the States to carry out this part.
