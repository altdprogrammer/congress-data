Limits the license term and renewal for Amateur or Personal (Citizen) Radio Services to ten years.

Requires the FCC to consider specified items in managing the spectrum available to the private land mobile services. Authorizes the FCC to delegate to non-Governmental coordinating committees the coordination of certain frequencies for stations in the private land mobile services. Authorizes the FCC to use as volunteers: (1) licensed amateur station operators to monitor amateur transmission violations; (2) licensed citizens band radio operators to monitor citizens band transmission violations; and (3) licensed amateur station operators to prepare or administer examinations for amateur station operator licenses. Prohibits any such volunteer from being considered a Federal employee. Defines private land mobile services. Authorizes the FCC to allow radio stations to operate without licenses in the Radio Control or Citizen Band Radio Services if the station operators comply with the Communications Act of 1934 and applicable regulations."
