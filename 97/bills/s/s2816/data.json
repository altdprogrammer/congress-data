Requires the service benefit plan and the indemnity benefit plan to include, in addition to all types of benefits currently authorized: (1) nervous and mental disorder benefits; and (2) alcoholism and substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation benefits. Requires all Federal employee health benefit plans to include benefits for costs for general hospital care and health services of a catastrophic nature."
