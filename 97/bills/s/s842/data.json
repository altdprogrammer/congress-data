    "text": "RARE II Review Act of 1981 - Denies jurisdiction to any court of the United States to take any judicial action with respect to the legal or factual sufficiency of the Department of Agriculture's second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II) final environmental statement (date January, 1979), recommending certain areas for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Applies such denial of jurisdiction with respect to any order of a court, department, or agency of the United States or of any State whether issued before or after the enactment of this Act. Deems the RARE II review and evaluation of national forest lands west of the one hundredth meridian to be an adequate consideration of their suitability for inclusion in the National Preservation System. Declares that lands recommended for wilderness in the RARE II final environmental statement but not placed into the System by Act of Congress before January 1, 1985, shall lose their recommendation. Consigns to same fate any lands in further planning upon enactment of this Act and not recommended for wilderness by September 30, 1985, or recommended by such date but not placed into the System by Act of Congress before January 1, 1988. Declares that areas of national forest lands east of the one hundredth meridian which were subject to the RARE II review and recommended for wilderness shall become Wilderness Study Areas, and, after January 1, 1983, shall be managed for uses other than wilderness, unless Congress otherwise directs. Requires any such areas not recommended for wilderness to be managed for other uses. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture, unless expressly authorized and directed by Congress, from conducting any further statewide, regional, or national roadless area review and evaluation of National Forest System lands for determination of suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Prohibits the Secretary from reviewing any National Forest System lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System unless expressly authorized by joint resolution of Congress. States that the designation of any wilderness area shall not lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around any such area."
