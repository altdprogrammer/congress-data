Extends such liability for damage to specified sheep herds caused by the Nancy nuclear detonation or the Harry nuclear detonation. Bars actions for damages under this Act after a specified date. Grants exclusive original jurisdiction to the appropriate district court for actions under this Act. Establishes, within the Department of Health and Human Services, an Advisory Panel on the Health Effects of Exposure to Radiation and Uranium. Directs the Advisory Panel to identify those cancers and diseases that are more likely to develop in human beings after exposure to low-level radiation or after working in uranium mines. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint such personnel as may be necessary to enable the Advisory Panel to carry out its functions under this Act. Requires that the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall provide such administrative support services as the Advisory Panel may request. Directs the Advisory Panel to report its findings to Congress within one year. Exempts the Advisory Panel from the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to assess the adverse health effects resulting from the atomic weapons test program at the Nevada test site. Transfers to the Department of Health and Human Services all functions of the Department of Energy concerning the health effects of radiation on human beings."
