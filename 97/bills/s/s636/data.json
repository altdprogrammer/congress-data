    "text": "Veterans' Administration Health Care Amendments of 1981 - Entitles the United States to recover the costs of certain medical care and services furnished to a veteran for a non-service-connected disability when such disability is covered by another form of insurance or compensation. Sets forth the formula and procedure for the United States' recovery against the insurer or other entity. Subrogates the United States to the rights of such veteran. Extends for one year the period during which funds appropriated for the establishment of a new State medical school may be expended. Amends the Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 to permit the expansion of the scope of the epidemiological study of the health effects of Agent Orange to include an evaluation of the long term adverse health effects in humans serving in the armed forces of the United States in Vietnam during the Vietnamese conflict or other factors involved in such service, including exposure to other herbicides, chemicals, medications, or environmental hazards or conditions. Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to expand the scope of the literature analysis and review to include an analysis and review of the literature covering other studies relating to the effects of such factors. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations establishing guidelines, standards, and criteria for resolving claims for benefits based on exposure to Agent Orange and such other factors during such conflict."
