    "text": "Financial Institutions Restructuring and Services Act of 1981 - Title I: Depository Institutions Insurance and Services - Depository Institutions Insurance and Services Act of 1981 - Part A - Form of Charter; Demand Accounts - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to authorize the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to charter Federal associations known as Federal savings and loan associations or Federal savings banks (currently Federal mutual savings banks) to provide thrift institutions for the deposit or investment of funds and for the extension of credit for homes and other goods and services. Permits an association to raise capital in the form of demand accounts as are authorized by its charter or by regulations of the Board. Directs that all savings accounts and demand accounts will have the same priority upon liquidation. Reduces, from 30 days to 14 days, the statutory notice-of-withdrawal period for savings accounts. Eliminates the prohibition against the issuance of capital stock by Federal savings and loans. Grants any association the authority to issue such capital stock. Permits any institution that is a Federal Home Loan Bank member (or is eligible to become a member) to convert to a Federal Savings and Loan Association, a Federal savings bank, or a Federal mutual savings bank (and in doing so may change directly from the mutual form to the stock form, or the reverse). Revises the procedures and requirements for conversion of any Federal association back to a State type institution. Allows any aggrieved person to obtain review of a final action of the Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation which approves or disapproves a plan of conversion from the mutual to the stock form. Permits any Federal savings bank chartered as such prior to the enactment of this Act or any Federal savings bank formerly organized as a mutual savings bank to continue to make any investment or engage in any activity not otherwise authorized by this Act to the degree it was authorized to do so prior to enactment of this Act. Amends the National Housing Act to retain Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation jurisdiction over State mutual to State stock conversions involving insured institutions. Eliminates specified reporting requirements concerning such conversion activity. Eliminates the prohibition against the creation of Federal stock institutions in States where stock associations do not exist. Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to include all Federal savings banks within the definition of \"insured institution.\" Part B - Investments - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to revise the investment authority of associations with respect to: (1) account loans; (2) real property loans; (3) deposits; (4) State securities; (5) commercial and other loans; (6) housing and land and urban development insured or guaranteed investments; (7) corporate securities; (8) investment companies; (9) consumer loans; (10) investments in personalty; (11) education loans; (12) service corporations; (13) foreign assistance investments; and (14) small business investment companies. Permits a Federal association to engage in activities and ventures incidental to the exercise of investment authority. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to permit members of Federal Home Loan Banks to use their investments in time and savings deposits in other members, or in institutions eligible to become members, to help satisfy the statutory requirement that they maintain a certain amount of liquid assets. Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to prohibit an association from establishing, retaining, or operating a branch outside the State in which the association has its home office, unless the association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code or meets the asset composition test imposed under such Act on institutionals seeking so to qualify. Sets forth exceptions to such limitation. Prohibits any savings and loan holding company, or any subsidiary thereof which is not an insured institution, and whose subsidiary insured institution fails to qualify as a domestic building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code, from commencing, or continuing for more than three years after such failure, any business activity other than those specified for multiple savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries. Part C - Preemption of Due- On-Sale Prohibitions - Declares that the provisions of the constitution or the laws of any State limiting the ability of any lender to enter into contracts, or to enforce contracts which provide that the lender may declare due and payable sums secured by the lender's security instrument if the property, or an interest therein, securing the loan is sold or transferred without the lender's prior written consent shall not apply to contracts involving loans secured by a lien or residential real property where such loans are originated by institutions chartered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Comptroller the Currency, or the National Credit Union Administration Board. Makes the exercise by the institution of such a due-on-sale option exclusively governed by the terms of the loan contract. Sets forth the procedure for the issuance of rules, regulations, and interpretations of such limitations. Declares that such provisions shall not apply in any State after the date (on or after the date of enactment of this Act and before three years after the date of enactment) on which such State adopts a law or certifies that the voters of such State have voted in favor of any provision, constitutional or otherwise, which states explicitly and by its terms that such State does not want such provisions to apply in such State. Part D - Extraordinary Authority Relating to Thrifts - Amends the National Housing Act to permit the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, notwithstanding any other provision of State or Federal law (except antitrust law), to authorize an insured institution eligible for Corporation assistance to merge with any other insured institution or a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured bank, or to be acquired by any holding company.

Provides the Corporation with conservatorship and receivership powers over State-chartered insured institutions. Declares that in such cases the Corporation shall have the same powers and duties with respect to insured institutions as are conferred upon it under such Act with respect to Federal associations. Grants the Corporation, in connection with the liquidation of insured institutions, the power to carry on the business of and to collect all obligations to the insured institutions, to settle, compromise, or release claims in favor of or against the insured institutions, subject only to the regulation of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, or in cases where the Corporation has been appointed conservator, receiver, or legal custodian solely by a public authority, subject only to the regulation of such public authority. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to allow the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, upon its determination that a severe financial condition threatens the stability of member institutions, to waive the requirements of such Act which require a portion of net earnings of Federal Home Loan Banks to be set aside semi-annually to a reserve account, and to pay dividends from undivided profits. Amends the National Housing Act to permit the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Banks provided that the rate on such loan is not less than the Federal Home Loan Banks' marginal cost of funds, and the loan is adequately secured. Permits the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, upon its determination that extraordinary financial conditions exist increasing the risk to the Corporation, to terminate distribution of shares of the secondary reserve and utilize such reserve on the same basis as the primary reserve. Part E - Extraordinary Authority Relating to Banks - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to permit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, whenever severe financial conditions exist which threaten the stability of a significant number of insured banks, to make loans to, or purchase the assets of, or make deposits in, any insured bank so threatened if it is probable that such action will substantially reduce the risk of loss or avert a threatened loss to the Corporation. Permits the Corporation to provide assistance to any insured bank or Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation insured institution which will facilitate its merger or consolidation with an insured bank.

Authorizes a national bank to open or close, at its discretion, on a legal holiday declared by a State or District of Columbia official, unless the Comptroller directs otherwise.
