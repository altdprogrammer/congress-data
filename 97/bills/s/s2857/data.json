    "text": "National Port Development and Customs Revenue Sharing Act of 1982 - Establishes in the Treasury the Customs Revenue Sharing Trust Fund. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to expend money from the Fund to conduct the operation, maintenance, and navigation improvement authorized by this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to pay seven percent of all customs revenues collected during each preceding fiscal year into such Fund. Requires the Secretary to maintain the Fund at a specified level. Requires reversion to the Treasury of all unallocated moneys remaining in the Fund at the end of every five fiscal years. Requires the Secretary of the Army (Secretary), acting through the Chief of Engineers, to prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive port maintenance program with respect to each deep-draft commercial port. Sets forth procedures for the adoption and revision of such maintenance program by Congress. Establishes a consolidated port development permit program, in which such a permit shall constitute all necessary permits, authorizations and approvals required under federal law in order to construct, operate, and maintain a navigation improvement project and any shoreshide installations ancillary to the navigation improvement project. Sets forth the procedure for review and approval of permit applications. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to Congress recommending approval for any new channel improvement project within certain time periods. Directs the Secretary to expedite construction of new navigation improvement projects. Sets forth the terms of cost-sharing agreements and financing assistance for eligible navigation improvement projects. Declares that this Act does not modify, amend, or repeal any congressional authorization for the construction of a navigation improvement project to increase the depth of any channel in a deep-draft commercial port or to pay all of the costs of constructing and maintaining any navigation improvement project other than a project approved under this Act. Sets forth the Federal maintenance responsibilities for navigation improvement projects constructed pursuant to this Act. Grants exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any issue arising from the approval of the maintenance program, a program revision, or navigation improvement project. Prescribes the form for concurrent resolutions of congressional approval of projects under this Act. Grants congressional consent to the levying of duties of tonnages by the States. Requires the Secretary to establish guidelines for the use of public port authorities in computing the rates of duties of tonnage levied by them under this Act. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to carry out periodic audits of the operations of public port authorities that have elected duties of tonnage under this Act. States that the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation shall not provide facilities necessary to the operation and maintenance of seaway channels. Terminates the obligation of the Corporation to pay the principal on obligations incurred to finance its activities. Declares that any formula for a division of revenues from the Saint Lawrence Seaway shall not take into account annual debt charges and shall not include the total cost incurred by the United States in financing activities, but shall provide for an equitable division of the revenues of the seaway between the Corporation and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada. Requires that rates for use of the seaway be calculated to cover all costs of operating and maintaining the works under the administration of the Corporation, except for the cost of operating and maintaining connecting seaway channels. Declares that such rates shall not include any charge to amortize the principal of the debts and obligations of the Corporation which have been terminated by the United States."
