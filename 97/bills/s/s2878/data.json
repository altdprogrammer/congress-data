    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-08-20", 
    "text": "Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Labor to determine that increased imports \"contributed importantly to\" (currently, substantially caused) worker separations and sales or production reductions in order to certify such workers as eligible for trade adjustment assistance. Directs the Secretary of Labor to approve job training assistance for workers adversely affected by imports. (Currently the Secretary is authorized to approve such training.) Directs the Secretary to pay a daily supplemental assistance benefit to any worker who begins approved job training after enactment of this Act and who is not eligible for trade adjustment allowances. Provides for the reimbursement of persons who participated in a job training program between specified dates and who personally financed all or part of the tuition costs of such training. Increases the maximum job search and relocation allowances to $800. Authorizes any adversely affected worker to apply for a job search allowance, relocation allowance, or both if the worker: (1) was covered by an adjustment assistance certification issued between specified dates; and (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act is not eligible for either job search allowances or relocation allowances because of failure to file an application on time. Establishes an Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund in the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations to the Trust Fund, payable out of the general fund of the Treasury attributable to the collection of customs duties, to carry out provisions for adjustment assistance for workers. Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to amend the definition of \"suitable work\" for a worker who would be eligible for a trade readjustment allowance if the worker were not eligible for extended compensation."
