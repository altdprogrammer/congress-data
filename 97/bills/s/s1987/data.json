Authorizes appropriations to enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments to States for the costs of such services. (Currently funds for such payments are transferred from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund.) Requires a specified sum to be allocated among the States for such payments for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 according to the ratio of the number of individuals rehabilitated and terminated as beneficiaries in each State compared with the number of rehabilitated beneficiaries terminated in all States during fiscal years 1981 and 1982, respectively. Requires the amount paid to each State to be increased or decreased in succeeding fiscal years by the percentage increase or decrease in the number of rehabilitated beneficiaries terminated."
