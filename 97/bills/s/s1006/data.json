    "text": "Food Stamp Reform Act of 1981 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to prohibit any household from receiving increased benefits as a result of a member of the household being disqualified for fraudulent actions under such Act. Extends the period of ineligibility for heads of households who voluntarily quit a job without good cause from 60 days to six months. Amends such Act and the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to eliminate provisions authorizing food stamp eligibility to victims of disasters. Disallows food stamp coupon users from receiving cash for change from food purchases. Authorizes the disclosure of all information obtained from food stamp beneficiaries to local, State, or Federal law enforcement officials for the purpose of investigating possible violations of the Food Stamp Act or regulations issued under it. Requires state agencies to verify the size and income of applicant households in immediate need of food stamps because of lack of income. Authorizes state agencies to utilize unemployment and social security information to the extent permitted under the Social Security Act. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to discontinue issuing food stamps through the mail in any part of a State in which during a six-month period, a specified percentage of allotments were reported not received. Provides a procedure for repayment of ineligible food stamp benefits by coupon allotment reductions or cash payments. Directs the Secretary and State agencies to require household members to furnish their social security numbers as a condition of eligibility for the food stamp program. Makes this Act effective January 1, 1982."
