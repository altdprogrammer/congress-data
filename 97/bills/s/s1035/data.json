Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to modify income tax return forms to notify taxpayers of their option to contribute. Authorizes the transfer of designated amounts at least quarterly to the Arts Endowment and the Humanities Endowment. Imposes restrictions on the use of funds so transferred for administrative expenses. Directs the transfer of all such amounts to State arts agencies and State voluntary councils. Treats payments of funds to such agencies as donations from private persons and not as Federal assistance. Requires the use of amounts transferred to State agencies under this Act for grants for activities within the State. Imposes a 50 percent matching requirement on State agencies receiving assistance under this Act. Limits the total grant to 30 percent of the cost of any project for which a charge is made to the general public. Prohibits the use of funds raised under this Act for grants to any endowment funds or for other investment purposes."
