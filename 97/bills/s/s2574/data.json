    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1982 - Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to revise the authorization of appropriations for FY 1984 for the Interstate Highway System. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to apportion, for FY 1984, the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditures on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways according to specified factors. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund for FY 1983 for: (1) the Federal-aid primary system in rural areas (including extensions in urban areas and priority primary routes), and the Federal-aid secondary system in rural areas; (2) the Federal-aid urban system; (3) forest highways; (4) public lands highways; (5) economic growth center development highways; (6) the Great River Road for construction or reconstruction of roads on a Federal-aid highway system; (7) bridge replacement and rehabilitation; and (8) projects for the elimination of highway hazards. Restricts all funding under this Act to a specified determining factor. Prohibits any State from receiving less than one-half of one percent of the total apportionment for the Interstate System for fiscal year 1984. Sets forth the purposes for which any excess funding may be expended. Limits the apportionment of funds authorized for priority primary routes. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 to authorize appropriations for demonstration projects at railroad-highway crossings for FY 1983. Amends the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 to extend its \"Buy America\" provisions."
