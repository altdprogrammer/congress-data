Requires that retailers and distributors pay the amount of the affixed refund value on brands of beverages bought and sold by such retailers or distributors. Preempts inconsistent State and local law. Prohibits States from imposing any tax on the collection or return of refund values established by this Act. Prohibits distributors and retailers from selling beverages in metal beverage containers with detachable openings. Imposes penalties of up to $1,000 for violation of the provisions of this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor the rate of reuse and recycling of beverage containers. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress at specified intervals on the impact of this Act on: (1) conservation of energy and material resources; (2) resource recovery and the reduction of solid waste and litter; and (3) the economy. Directs the Administrator to consult with the Secretary of Labor on assisting individuals whose employment may be adversely affected by this Act."
