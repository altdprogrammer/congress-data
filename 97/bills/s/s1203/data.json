    "text": "Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize appropriations for the necessary expenses of the U.S. International Trade Commission for fiscal year 1982. Prohibits use of any such appropriations to pay for any study requested by any executive agency unless such agency reimburses the Commission. Amends the Trade Act of the 1974 to authorize appropriations to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for fiscal years 1982-1984. Limits the amount of such appropriations which may be used for entertainment and representation expenses. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 and each following fiscal year which reflect Office pay rate changes made in accordance with the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970. Title II: Functions and Powers - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the U.S. Trade Representative to: (1) promulgate such rules and regulations as necessary to carry out the powers and duties as well as the functions vested in the Representative; (2) delegate such Representative's functions, powers and duties to designated Office employees; (3) authorize successive redelegations of such functions, powers, and duties; (4) pay expenses for official travel without regard to specified Federal laws; (5) utilize gifts to aid or facilitate the work of the Office; and (6) acquire up to two cars for use abroad. Repeals the provisions of such Act which abolished the Office of Special Representative for Trade Negotiations and transferred personnel from such Office to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission to accept gifts to aid or facilitate the work of the Commission."
