Directs the President, upon making such a determination, to recommend to Congress: (1) terminating certain U.S. concessions affecting tariffs or import restrictions; and (2) ending the applicability to such country of legislation necessary to carry out trade agreements. Authorizes the President, upon making such determination, to proclaim increased tariffs or other import restrictions."
