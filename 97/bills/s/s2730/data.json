Exempts from such prohibition those cases where an initial disability benefit termination is based on a finding: (1) that the individual involved is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) of fraud; or (3) based on a scheduled review of which such individual was notified at the time of his or her initial entitlement. Requires the Secretary to notify individuals who have been or will be notified of a continuing disability investigation that no further decision will be made with respect to their cases during the period in which this Act is in effect."
