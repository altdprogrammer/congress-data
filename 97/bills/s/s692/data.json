Limits the total amount of such credit to five percent of taxable business income. Exempts such reserve fund from income taxation. Allows an income tax deduction for research expenses paid out of the reserve fund during the taxable year. Specifies that research financed pursuant to this Act shall be performed by an institution of higher education. Prescribes tax penalties for the use of funds from the research reserve for purposes other than research and experimentation."
