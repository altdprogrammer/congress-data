    "text": "Title I: Improvements in Adjustment Assistance for Workers - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of Labor to determine, before certifying workers eligible for adjustment assistance, that increased imports are the primary cause of (rather than an important contribution to) the workers' separation from employment and of a decline in sales or production. Requires such imports to be of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the workers' firm or for which such firm provides essential parts or services (currently workers in firms which provide such essential parts and services are not eligible for assistance). Requires that firms comply with specified provisions relating to petitions for certification of eligibility to apply for such assistance. Directs the Secretary to share with the Secretary of Commerce any useful information acquired because of a petition by workers for adjustment assistance if the workers' firm is petitioning the Secretary of Commerce for adjustment assistance. Requires a worker to exhaust all unemployment insurance benefits before receiving a trade readjustment allowance. Changes the formula for figuring the weekly trade adjustment allowance. Title II: Improvements in Adjustment Assistance to Firms - Requires increases of imports to be the primary cause of (rather than an important contribution to) the separation from employment of a firm's workers and of the firm's decline in sales or production in order for the firm to receive adjustment assistance. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to certify a firm eligible for adjustment assistance if the Secretary determines that: (1) at least 25 percent of such firm's sales consist of providing articles or services essential to an import-impacted article; (2) a significant number of such firm's workers have been totally or partially separated from employment; (3) there has been a decrease in sales or production; and (4) the primary cause of the separation of such firm's workers and of the firm's decline in sales and production was the decrease in sales or production of such firm's import-impacted customers. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to share with the Secretary of Labor any useful information acquired because of a petition by a firm for adjustment assistance if such firm's workers are petitioning the Secretary of Labor for adjustment assistance."
