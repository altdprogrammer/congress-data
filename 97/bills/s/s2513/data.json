    "text": "Farm Crisis Act of 1982 - Title I: Land Diversion Payments for 1982 Crops of Wheat, Feed Grains, Cotton, and Rice - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to set 1982 land diversion levels at: (1) $2.00 per bushel for wheat; (2) $1.25 per bushel for corn; (3) $.20 per pound for upland cotton; and (4) $2.20 per hundredweight for rice. Permits 1982 participants to divert an additional five percent of their acreage. Extends the application period through the end of the certification period. Title II: Acreage Limitation and Cropland Conservation Programs for 1983 through 1985 Crops - Directs the Secretary to proclaim a national cropland conservation program for 1983 through 1985 crop years. Provides that: (1) such program shall be approved or disapproved by a producer referendum; (2) participants will set aside 15 percent of their acreage for conservation purposes; (3) noncompliance shall result in a three-year denial of specified farm benefits; and (4) loan rates shall increase by ten percent when such program is in effect. Requires the Secretary to establish a voluntary set-aside program (based on specified carry-over levels) for the 1983 through 1985 wheat, feed grain, and upland cotton crops if cropland conservation programs are disapproved. Makes conforming amendments. Title III: Farm Storage Facility Loan Program - Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to direct the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to guarantee up to $250,000,000 annually (not more than 90 percent of any one loan to be guaranteed) for grower-harvested grain storage facility loans. Title IV: Barter of Agricultural Commodities for Strategic and Critical Materials and Petroleum Products - Authorizes the CCC to exchange agricultural products for oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress regarding CCC foreign products bartering. Title V: Emergency Agricultural Credit - Amends the Emergency Agricultural Credit Adjustment Act of 1978 to make the economic emergency loan program mandatory. Extends such program through FY 1983. Lowers the limit on individual loans: (1) under such Act; and (2) under such Act and the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act combined. Title VI: Agricultural Exports - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) $1,000,000,000 should be made available to the Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund; and (2) the Secretary should conclude a grain agreement with the Soviet Union. Title VII: White House Conference on Agriculture - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should convene a White House Conference on Agriculture within one year. Requires a conference report to the President and Congress."
