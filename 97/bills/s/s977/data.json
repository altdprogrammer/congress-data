    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to include among the circumstances in which a Governor of a State may issue a temporary emergency suspension for a fuel burning stationary source of any part of a State implementation plan for a national primary ambient air quality standard: (1) when such temporary suspension is essential to the State's economic welfare; or (2) when foreign imports of fuel used by such source have reached an excessive level and such imports can be reduced by the emergency suspension, e.g. allowing coal rather than foreign oil to be burned. Increases the maximum period for which such temporary emergency suspensions may be issued by a Governor or by the President to one year (currently four months). Prohibits such suspensions from remaining in effect if in violation of any national ambient air quality standard results."
