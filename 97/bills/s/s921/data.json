    "date": "1981-06-16", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 3499 passed in lieu) Veterans' Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1981 - Extends from December 31, 1981, to September 30, 1982, the authority of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to contract for hospital care or medical services in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands without reference to patient loads or incidence of provision of medical services for veterans treated by the Veterans' Administration in the contiguous 48 states. Entitles to hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care those veterans disabled by exposure to: (1) dioxin or any other toxic substance found in an herbicide, or a malaria preventive medication, while serving on active duty in Vietnam; or (2) radiation while participating in a nuclear weapons test while serving in the line of duty. Sets a time limit on the provision of such care. Measures the eligibility period for outpatient dental services for military personnel from the date of subsequent discharge from military service for persons who reenter active service within one year from such a person's prior discharge. Extends through September 30, 1984 (three additional years) the period during which Vietnam-era veterans may initially request psychological readjustment counseling. Excludes from such time limitation any time during such period in which such veteran was prevented from receiving such counseling: (1) because of a medical condition; or (2) because such veteran was incarcerated in a penal institution. Requires the Administrator during the final year of such program to provide for an orderly transition of such program to Veterans' Administration health care facilities. Extends the delimiting periods for vocational rehabilitation and educational assistance for eligible veterans and survivors of such veterans with an alcohol or drug dependence. Extends the delimiting period for educational assistance for specified Vietnam-era veterans for vocational training. Extends through September 30, 1984 (three additional years) the Vietnam-era veterans' readjustment appointments in the Federal Government. Extends for one year the period during which funds appropriated for the establishment of a new State medical school may be expended. Amends the Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 to permit the expansion of the scope of the epidemiological study of the health effects of Agent Orange to include: (1) an evaluation of the long term adverse health (including genetic and psychological) effects in humans serving in the armed forces of the United States in Vietnam during the Vietnamese conflict, or other factors involved in such service, including exposure to other herbicides, chemicals, medications, or environmental hazards or conditions; and (2) the means of detecting and treating such effects. Permits the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to include such factors and means of detection and treatment within the scope of the ongoing analysis and review of the literature covering other studies relating to the effects of Agent Orange. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations establishing guidelines, standards, and criteria for resolving claims for benefits based on exposure to Agent Orange and such other factors during such conflict. Amends the Veterans' Disability Compensation and Housing Benefits Amendment of 1980 to repeal a provision modifying the way in which employees working on a less than full-time basis in the Veterans' Administration's Department of Medicine and Surgery receive credit for such employment when their civil service annuities are computed. Increases the maximum amount of insurance obtainable under Servicemen's Group Life Insurance and Veterans' Group Life Insurance."
