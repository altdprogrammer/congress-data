    "text": "Amends the Reclamation Project Authorization Act of 1972 to include among the purposes of the closed basin division, San Luis Valley project in Colorado: (1) the establishment of the Russell Lakes Waterfowl Management Area; and (2) the furnishing of a partial water supply for the operation of the Blanca Wildlife Habitat Area and the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge. Repeals the establishment of the Mishak National Wildlife Refuge under such Act. Requires that the Secretary of the Interior establish such project according to engineering plans as modified by the plans shown in the Fish and Wildlife Plan dated June 1981. Prohibits the Secretary from allowing a reduction in artesian flows in existence prior to the operation of each stage of such project. (Currently, the Secretary is required to operate the project so as not to allow a reduction in artesian flows in existence prior to the construction of the project.) Provides that the maintenance of the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge and the Blanca Wildlife Habitat Area shall be second on the priority list for the supply of water from the project. Prohibits the amount of project salvaged water delivered from the conveyance channel to the refuge and the habitat area from exceeding 5,3000 acre-feet annually. Provides that private lands needed for the project shall be acquired only by easements, in order to minimize the removal of land from local tax rolls. (Currently, the acquisition of such private lands is restricted to easements and rights-of-way.) Requires that lands required for permanent project facilities be acquired by fee title."
