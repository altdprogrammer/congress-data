Limits such exclusion to interest earned on $100,000 certificates ($200,000 if joint return is filed). Defines \"qualified housing savings certificates\" as investment certificates issued by regulated depository financial institutions with three or five year maturities. Specifies that the proceeds of such certificates be applied to the financing of single-family, owner-occupied residences. Prescribes limitations on the interest rate chargeable for mortgages financed with proceeds from a qualified housing savings certificate. Disqualifies families which have income more than twice the median family income for their area from receiving a mortgage financed from proceeds from a qualified housing savings certificate. Prescribes penalties for the improper use of qualified housing savings certificates."
