    "text": "Bilingual Education Amendments of 1981 - Amends title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (Bilingual Education Programs, also known as the Bilingual Education Act) to revise bilingual education policy to no longer require that children of limited English proficiency use their native language while receiving instruction to achieve competence in English. Revises an element of the definition of \"limited English proficiency\" to refer to \"individuals who have difficulty speaking and understanding instruction in the English language.\" Redefines \"program of bilingual instruction\" to require inclusion of \"an intensive course of study in English.\" Revises grant provisions to require that bilingual education programs limit participation by any child to one year. Permits an additional year of participation only if an individual evaluation establishes the need for continued services and is approved by the appropriate local education agency official. Prohibits enrollment of any non-handicapped child for more than three years. Sets forth requirements for such individual evaluations. Directs the Secretary of Education to withhold application approval or grant payments whenever a bilingual education program is unable or unwilling to comply with such limitations on individual participation and with such individual evaluation requirements."
