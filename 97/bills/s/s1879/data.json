Revises procedures by which the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) oversees the purchase of bankrupt rail lines by such financially responsible persons. Amends the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act to grant authority to the ICC to authorize continued rail service under this Act over the lines of the Rock Island Railroad until the disposition of the properties of the estate of the Rock Island Railroad. Extends ICC authority to order directed service over certain commuter lines of the Rock Island Railroad. Amends the Interstate Commerce Act to eliminate limitations on the amount of railroad equipment used to transport paper products and certain forest products pursuant to contracts."
