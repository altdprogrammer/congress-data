    "text": "Airline Deregulation Amendments Act of 1981 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to modify the definition of \"ticket agent\" as used in such Act. Directs air carriers to file with the Civil Aeronautics Board until December 31, 1982, individual and joint fares and charges, classifications, rules, and services for or in connection with interstate and overseas passenger air transportation. Requires that such filings shall be made to the Secretary of Transportation between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1984. Prohibits air carriers and ticket agents from charging or collecting greater or less or different compensation than that specified in such filings. Transfers the authority of the Board relating to foreign air transportation to the Department of Transportation. Accelerates to January 1, 1983, the transfer of specified authority of the Board. Allows the Board to approve any contract or agreement that reduces or eliminates competition if it finds that the contract or agreement is necessary to secure important public benefits, including the marketing and sale of transportation through ticket agents. Sets forth the expiration dates for specified authority of the Secretary relating to contract approvals. Revises the expiration date and contents of the Secretary's (formerly the Board's) report to Congress concerning the implementation of such Act. Prohibits the Board from issuing any final order or rule in regard to agreements among air carriers and agreements among foreign air carriers insofar as those agreements provide for the accreditation and supervision of travel agents. Directs the Board to forward the recommendations and analyses concerning such proceedings to the Secretary for final disposition. Prohibits the Board and the Department from attaching an expiration date on any certificate of public convenience and necessity. Deletes provisions concerning the issuance of such certificates for temporary authority to provide air transportation. Permits an air carrier to file an application with the Secretary seeking to revoke a temporary or experimental certificate to engage in foreign air transportation. Directs the Secretary to grant such application according to specified criteria. Requires that each air carrier or foreign air carrier shall keep on file with the Board after January 1, 1983, the established divisions of all joint rates, fares, and charges for air transportation in which such carrier participates."
