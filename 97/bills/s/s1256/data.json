Requires a Federal district court to determine the propriety of the proposed dealership in accordance with specified guidelines in the event the existing dealer objects to its establishment. Includes among such guidelines: (1) whether the additional dealership is warranted by current economic and marketing conditions; (2) the permanency of the investment of the objecting dealer; and (3) whether the objecting dealer is providing adequate competition and sales, convenient service, and adequate facilities, equipment, and parts. Stipulates that the desire for further market penetration shall not in itself justify the establishment of a new dealership. Authorizes a dealer to bring an action against a supplier in Federal district court for damages, equitable relief, and attorney fees and other costs. Permits an award of treble damages for willful violations. Stipulates that this Act shall not be construed to modify any provision of the antitrust laws."
