    "date": "1981-04-09", 
    "text": "Amends the Bail Reform Act of 1966 to authorize a judicial officer, in making a determination of whether a person charged with a noncapital offense should be released on bail, to consider the safety of any person or the community (in addition to assurance of appearance as currently provided). Amends the Federal criminal code to establish penalties for taking by force and violence or intimidation a controlled substance from a licensed pharmacy engaged in retail dispensing in interstate commerce of prescription drugs, where such robbery is part of a pattern of such robberies in the locality. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Redefines such offense as using a firearm to commit a felony over which the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction or carrying a firearm during such a felony involving violence. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five years for a first offender (currently, one to ten years) and five years for a second or subsequent offender, plus five years for each conviction after the first (currently, two to 25 years for a second or subsequent offender). Establishes a mandatory life sentence without parole for anyone convicted of a violent felony, who has previously been convicted in Federal court of two independent, violent felonies. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to: (1) classify arson as a part I crime in the Uniform Crime Reports; and (2) prepare a special statistical report in cooperation with the National Fire Data Center on the crime of arson."
