    "text": "Emergency Farm Relief Act of 1982 - Title I: Loan Rates for the 1982 Crops - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to increase 1982 loan rates for: (1) wheat from $3.55 to $4.00 per bushel; (2) corn from $2.55 to $2.90 per bushel; (3) upland cotton from $.55 to $.61 per pound; and (4) rice from $8.00 to $8.90 per hundredweight. Title II: Cropland Conversion and Acreage Limitation Programs for 1983 through 1985 Crops - Subtitle A: Cropland Conservation Program - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to proclaim a national cropland conservation program for the 1983 through 1985 wheat, feed grain, upland cotton, and rice crops. Requires participants to set aside 15 percent of their cropland for conservation use. Provides that: (1) such program will be approved or disapproved by a producer referendum; (2) if approved, commodity support levels will be set as provided for in title I of this Act; and (3) noncompliance will result in a three-year denial of specified farm benefits. Subtitle B: Acreage Limitation Program - Requires the Secretary to establish set-aside programs for the 1983 through 1985 wheat, feed grain, and upland cotton crops if cropland conservation programs are disapproved. Bases such set-asides on specified carry-over levels for such crops. Subtitle C: Miscellaneous - Makes conforming amendments. Title III: Farm Storage Facility Loan Program - Amends the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to direct the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to guarantee up to $250,000,000 annually (not more than 90 percent of any one loan to be guaranteed) for grower-harvested grain storage facility loans. Title IV: Barter of Agricultural Commodities for Strategic and Critical Materials and Petroleum Products - Authorizes the CCC to exchange agricultural products for oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress regarding CCC foreign products bartering. Title V: Emergency Agricultural Credit - Amends the Emergency Agricultural Credit Adjustment Act of 1978 to make the economic emergency loan program mandatory. Extends such program through FY 1983. Lowers the limit on individual loans: (1) under such Act; and (2) under such Act and the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act combined. Title VI: Agricultural Exports - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) $1,000,000,000 should be made available to the Agricultural Export Credit Revolving Fund; and (2) the Secretary should conclude a grain agreement with the Soviet Union. Title VII: White House Conference on Agriculture - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should convene a White House Conference on Agriculture within one year. Requires a Conference report to the President and Congress."
