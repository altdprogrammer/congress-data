Reserves a portion of such funds for unanticipated changes and requires the submission of an explanatory statement on such changes to specified congressional committees before such funds may be obligated. Authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration to increase expenditures or decrease the amount of space to be constructed, up to specified limits, if the project costs exceed the estimated maximum cost authorized . Directs the Administrator to report to specified congressional committees. Requires congressional approval of any other action."
