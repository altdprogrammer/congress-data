Requires an agency to give written notice to a submitter of information whenever such agency receives a request for information not already in the public domain which has been obtained from any private source or which concerns any individually identifiable private party. Permits a submitter to provide the agency with written objections to disclosure of the records. Directs an agency to provide a submitter who makes a timely request to an informal ex parte hearing. Requires the agency to make a final decision regarding disclosure within 30 days of the hearing. Subjects an agency determination following such procedures to disclose all or part of the records to de novo review in Federal district court. Requires the agency to sustain its action by a preponderance of the evidence. Authorizes the court to assess against the United States attorney fees and other costs in any case in which the complainant has substantially prevailed."
