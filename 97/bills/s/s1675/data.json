    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-09-28", 
    "text": "Hunger Elimination and Global Security Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should make development of poor countries and the eradication of poverty and hunger the primary objective of U.S. foreign policy. Directs the President to designate certain foreign aid programs as Hunger Relief and Prevention Assistance. Title I: Public Law 480 - Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to replace the provision describing self-help programs developed under agreements for the sale of farm products for foreign currency and long-term-dollar-credit. Requires such agreements to describe the self-help programs and to provide for the termination of the agreement or adjustment of its credit terms whenever the President finds that the program is not being carried out as specified in the agreement. Prohibits termination or credit adjustment of such an agreement if the President reports to Congress that: (1) such action would threaten U.S. security; or (2) the program was not carried out because of circumstances beyond the control of the recipient country. Requires the self-help measures to be sufficiently described so that the primary beneficiaries of the agreement will be needy people. Defines \"needy people.\" Requires such measures to be in addition to measures that the recipient country would otherwise have taken. Directs the President to verify that such measures are being carried out and to report to the appropriate congressional committees on such verification and on the additional nature of such measures. Title II: Multilateral Development Banks - Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to work within certain multilateral development banks to establish a requirement that not less than 50 percent of such banks' lending must benefit needy people. Requires the Secretaries of State and Treasury to report to Congress annually on establishing such requirement. Title III: World Food Security - Directs the President to encourage other grain exporting countries to establish their own food security reserves or take other measures that complement the U.S. food security reserve. Directs the President to report to Congress on actions taken with respect to such food security reserves. Directs the President to negotiate with other countries and with certain organizations to try to ensure that the benefits of the food financing facility recently approved by the International Monetary Fund be directed to effect the maximum feasible reduction in hunger and malnutrition. Directs the President to report to Congress on such negotiations. Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to prohibit the Secretary of Commerce from imposing export controls on food if such controls would cause measurable malnutrition in the countries against whom the controls are proposed unless the President determines such controls are necessary to protect U.S. national security. Title IV: Basic Human Needs Agreement - Requires a Basic Human Needs Agreement between the United States and a foreign country before the foreign country may receive bilateral development assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Exempts from such requirement assistance for narcotics control, disaster relief, or peacekeeping operations. Sets forth the goals of such agreements. Title V: Relief and Prevention of Starvation - African Assistance and Hunger Prevention Act - Requires at least 50 percent of all U.S. international development assistance funds beginning in fiscal year 1983 to be used to finance productive facilities primarily for the absolutely poor. Defines the \"absolutely poor.\" Requires special emphasis to be placed on alleviating hunger in sub-Saharan Africa and on the role of women in farm production in that region. Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to earmark for the food for development program a specified percentage of the aggregate value of all agreements entered into under the program for the sale of farm products for foreign currency and long-term-dollar-credit. Requires certain commodities and funds to be used to establish grain reserves in famine prone African nations or to otherwise prepare for food shortages in those nations. Title VI: General Provisions - Expresses the sense of Congress that the President, acting through the Director of the Peace Corps, should emphasize projects to alleviate hunger and malnutrition by encouraging agricultural self-sufficiency in countries where Peace Corps volunteers are serving."
