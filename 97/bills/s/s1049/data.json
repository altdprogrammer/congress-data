    "text": "Employee Retirement Savings Contribution Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit participants in tax-qualified retirement savings plans to make tax deductible contributions to such plans and to individual retirement accounts (IRA) to the extent of $2,000 or 15 percent of taxable compensation, whichever is lesser. Permits government employees not subject to social security taxes to claim a tax deduction for contributions to a retirement savings plan of up to $2,000, to the extent that contributions exceed the amount they would otherwise pay in social security taxes. Increases the maximum income tax deduction for contributions to an IRA to $2,000 ($2,250 for spousal IRAs). Treats employee contributions to retirement savings plans as employer contributions for purposes of the tax treatment of such contributions."
