    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 97-479) Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982 - Sets forth the findings of Congress in regard to the transfer of the Alaska Railroad to the State of Alaska. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to transfer, without direct monetary consideration, the rail properties of the Alaska Railroad to the State of Alaska. Lists conditions that must be met before such transfer may be made. Requires that such transfer be made by a deed of conveyance as soon as possible after the Secretary has certified that the conditions have been met. Reserves to the Secretary of the Interior in such deed: (1) the right to use and occupy, without compensation, specified land at Talkeetna, Alaska, for National Park Service administrative activities; and (2) existing and future rights-of-way and easements in the Denali National Park and Preserve for Park administration, transportation and utility purposes. Requires the Secretary of Transportation and the Governor of Alaska, within six months after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress and the State Legislature in detail on the rail properties to be transferred under this Act, the liabilities and obligations to be assumed by the State, and the sum of money, if any, in the Alaska Railroad Revolving Fund to be withheld from the State pursuant to such transfer. Grants the State the right of access, during the period after enactment of this Act and until the transfer of the railroad, to the properties of, and records pertaining to, such railroad. Directs the Secretary and the railroad not to take certain actions during such period. Demands that before transfer the railroad's accounting practices and systems be capable of reporting data to the Interstate Commerce Commission in formats required of comparable rail carriers. Sets forth the status of the rail properties to be transferred and provides for the adjudication of valid existing rights to them. Excludes lands among the rail properties from selection by the Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress before January 15, 1984, on the lands available for selection. Prohibits claims for such rail properties under any Federal law other than this Act for which title has not vested with the claimant. Describes the employment status of Alaska Railroad employees who transfer to the State under this Act. Declares that, after the transfer directed by this Act, the State-owned railroad shall be a rail carrier engaged in interstate and foreign commerce subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Authorizes the State to invoke by law exemption from antitrust laws. Allows the State or State-owned railroad to request the Secretary of the Interior, or when appropriate the Secretary of Agriculture, to grant a right-of-way across Federal lands for transportation and related purposes. Provides for the reversion of the railroad properties to the United States if all or part of them have been converted to a use that would adversely affect railroad operations. Sets forth provisions for rail properties within the boundaries of the Denali National Park and Preserve. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to dispose of the rail properties if the State has not met the conditions of this Act within one year of the report to Congress by the Secretary and the Governor of Alaska. Mandates the transfer of the improved portion of Alaska Railroad land next to the McKinley Park Station to the Secretary of the Interior for administration as part of the Denali National Park and Preserve. Exempts actions under this Act from certain Federal statutes. Declares that the provisions of this Act shall govern over a conflict with any other law. Repeals and makes amendments to certain Acts to conform to provisions of this Act."
