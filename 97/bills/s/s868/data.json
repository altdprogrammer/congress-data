Rept, 97-188) Competitive Export Financing Act of 1981 - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to direct the Export-Import Bank to adopt export finance programs comparable to those extraordinary export measures offered by competing countries, until such foreign finance programs are limited by international agreements. Authorizes appropriations for such programs. Requires the Bank to report annually to Congress on: (1) whether additional funds are necessary to carry out this Act; and (2) methods of administering such programs to encourage greater penetration of foreign markets by U.S. small businesses. Terminates such programs if the President notifies Congress that such programs violate international agreements."
