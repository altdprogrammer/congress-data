Repeals the requirement that such U.S. citizens work in hardship areas to be eligible for the tax exclusion. Reduces the length of the residency requirement for the tax exclusion. Provides for an income tax exclusion for the value of employer-provided lodging in a camp in cases where satisfactory housing is not generally available. Reduces the length of the foreign residency requirement with respect to the deduction for certain housing expenses of living abroad."
