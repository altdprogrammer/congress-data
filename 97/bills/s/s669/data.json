    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to substitute the word \"resources\" for \"Steam\" and to modify the definition of \"known geothermal resources area.\" Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue geothermal leases in any lands withdrawn or acquired for any Federal agency. Provides for an expedited bidding and leasing system for lands within any known geothermal resources area. Requires the development of uniform standards for consideration and approval of permits for exploration and testing of geothermal resources on lands subject to wilderness study under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and lands within the National Forest System. Directs the Secretary to include stipulations in any lease, assuring that exploration and testing activities do not permanently impair the wilderness values of such lands. Provides that the establishment of such standards shall satisfy any requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act applicable to exploration and testing. Extends the State-wide acreage limitation for geothermal leases to 51,200 acres. Exempts from such limitation any lease which contains a well determined by the U.S. Geological Survey to be capable of being commercially productive. Authorizes geothermal leases for lands withdrawn or acquired for the Department of Defense only with the consent of and under conditions prescribed by the head of such Department. Directs the Secretary to grant, at no cost, permits for the use of a geothermal resource, with specified restrictions, to surface owners or occupants of lands subject to this Act. Authorizes the head of a Federal agency to use any geothermal resource within lands under such agency's jurisdiction if such use is in the public interest and will not deter commercial development of such resources. Sets time limits for the review and approval of lease applications and exploratory permit applications pursuant to a lease. Directs the Secretary to establish diligence requirements for exploratory activities on leased lands. Permits the Secretary to defer royalty payments for nonelectric geothermal developments for municipal, cooperative, or other political subdivision lessees where legal limitations on front-end financing would prohibit or significantly deter development. Directs the Secretary to identity and publish in the Federal Register the geothermal features located on lands within national parks and monuments. Authorizes the issuance of geothermal leases on Federal lands within specified geographic zones outside such parks or monuments only after a determination that geothermal exploration activities pursuant to such a lease will not adversely affect such geothermal features. Prohibits the issuance of a loan, grant, or license for geothermal exploration within such geographic zone or non-Federal lands within such parks or monuments unless the activities so assisted will not adversely affect such geothermal features. Directs the Secretary to implement immediately the new leasing and operating procedures under this Act. Sets forth such procedures. Requires that a maximum of ten percent of the tracts leased in any one year shall be offered to public bodies, including rural electric cooperatives, to produce energy for their own use or for sale to their members or customers. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to ensure prompt reoffering of all relinquished, abandoned, and expired geothermal leaseholds. Provides that the diligence requirements under this Act for a lease which enters a unit plan shall be satisfied by compliance with diligence requirements on any lease within the unit so long as the lease remains within the unit."
