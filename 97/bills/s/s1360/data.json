    "text": "Regulatory Negotiation Act of 1981 - Title I: General Provisions - Defines a \"regulatory negotiation commission\" as a group formed voluntarily by private individuals to study one or more regulatory issues. Declares that the group shall be composed of representatives of the major positions on the regulatory issues and shall attempt to negotiate a consensus on recommendations for regulatory policy. Title II: Funds for Regulatory Negotiation Commissions - Directs the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States to establish a pilot program to provide funds to create and operate five regulatory negotiation commissions during fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Requires the Chairman to publicize the availability of such funds for commissions on regulatory policy in the areas of health, safety, and the environment. Sets forth: (1) the required contents of applications for funding; (2) the criteria for approving a commission to receive funds; and (3) restrictions on the use of funds. Prohibits the Chairman from approving an application unless the Chairman is satisfied that the major interests will be represented or allowed to participate in the commission's activities. Directs each funded commission to issue a final report outlining areas of consensus, areas of disagreement, and recommendations. Requires a Federal agency to send an observer to any public meeting of a funded commission at the commission's request. Authorizes the observer to make suggestions to the commission and to report to his or her agency on commission activities, but not to represent the agency or negotiate policy. Directs agencies to transmit comments on commission reports to Congress for potential review and action and to consider seriously the recommendations of any commission not funded under this Act. Title III: Miscellaneous - Exempts regulatory negotiation commissions from provisions of Federal law governing ex parte communications with an agency, specified provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Requires the Chairman to report to Congress on the pilot program established under this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
