    "text": "Federal Public Transportation Act of 1982 - Amends the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from making a discretionary capital grant or loan unless the applicant has sufficient capability to maintain the facilities and equipment purchased with such grant or loan. Sets forth the Federal share for grants to assist projects under this Act, including projects for the construction of certain fixed guideway systems. Prohibits alteration of Federal share commitments before enactment of this Act, including projects within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area transit system. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985 for: (1) grants or loans to States and local public agencies; (2) long-range planning and technical studies; (3) grants and loans to meet the needs of the elderly and handicapped; and (4) the grant program for areas other than urbanized areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985 for: (1) research, development, and demonstration projects; (2) grants for managerial, technical and professional training programs; (3) grants for research and training in urban transportation problems; and (4) the establishment and operation of transportation centers at nonprofit institutions of higher learning. Limits the amounts available for appropriations under this Act for FY 1983 and 1984. Establishes a formula capital and operating assistance program to finance the planning, acquisition, construction, improvement, and operating costs of facilities, equipment, and maintenance items in mass transportation service. Sets forth the apportionments of such funds for urbanized areas, and the Federal share payable for such projects. Allows States to transfer apportionments between urbanized areas of different sizes. Sets forth requirements for entities to receive such grants. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate congressional committees before issuing letters of intent to obligate funds under this Act. Directs the Secretary to give priority to such commitments approved before enactment of this Act. Makes funds available under the urban mass transit program available for expenditure through 1985. Revises the definition of construction to include any bus rehabilitation project which extends the economic life of a bus by five or more years. Revises the definition of fixed guideway to include any transportation facility which utilizes a right-of-way rail usable by other forms of transportation and a public transit facility which utilizes a fixed catenary system. Repeals the intercity bus service/terminal development program and safety authority provisions of the National Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1974. Terminates funding for the waterborne transportation demonstration project. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 through 1985 for the transit capital infrastructure program. Sets forth requirements for receiving grants under such program."
