    "text": "Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (as amended by specified provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981) to provide that individuals filing claims for compensation, including regular, extended, supplemental, and sharable regular compensation, shall be counted for purposes of determining the insured unemployment rate. Makes such change retroactive to June 1, 1982, for purposes of counting those on extended benefits. Provides that a State shall not be deemed out of compliance with specified Internal Revenue Code provisions by reason of a failure to amend its State unemployment compensation law within a specified period to include any requirement imposed by this Act. Permits States to choose to implement such changes prior to the time that changes in the State unemployment compensation law are formally adopted."
