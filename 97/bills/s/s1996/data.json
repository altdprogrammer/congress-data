    "text": "Violent Crime Act of 1981 - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment for dangerous special offenders. Makes such defendants ineligible for probation or parole. Extends the category of dangerous special offenders to include defendants who: (1) use or threaten to use a firearm or dangerous weapon during commission of the felony; and (2) inflict serious bodily injury upon another individual while committing, attempting to commit, or concealing commission of the felony. Broadens the coverage of the prohibition against killing designated U.S. employees to include killing any U.S. employee on account of the performance of his or her official duties. Applies the current prohibition against Congressional assassination or assault to heads of executive departments. Establishes as new Federal crimes: (1) contract murder or assault; (2) assaulting, kidnapping, murdering, or threatening the relative of any Federal employee with intent to interfere with such employee's official duties; and (3) robbery of a pharmacy engaged in interstate sales by anyone who has previously engaged in a pattern of such robberies. Sets as a specific goal of the Justice Department's narcotics law enforcement policy the identification and elimination of the 100 most sophisticated narcotic trafficking organizations in America. Directs the Attorney General to report to Congress on how reorganization of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department's general narcotics control policy will accomplish this goal."
