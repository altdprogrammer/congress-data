    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 3413 passed in lieu) Department of Energy National Security Programs Authorization Act of 1982 - Title I: National Security Programs - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to the Department of Energy for operating expenses incurred in carrying out national security programs, including scientific research and development, strategic and critical materials necessary for common defense, military applications of nuclear energy, and additional authorizations for specific projects. Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of funds authorized under this Act where the costs of the program exceed 105 percent of the program authorization or the costs exceed by more than $10,000,000 the amount authorized by this Act, whichever is the lesser. Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this Act for programs which have not been presented to, or requested of, Congress unless 30 calendar days have elapsed since the Secretary of Energy has presented to the appropriate congressional committees a full and complete statement of the action proposed. Allows the written waiver of such requirement where such waiver is approved in writing by each appropriate congressional committee. Authorizes the Secretary to start any general plant project only if the maximum estimated cost of such project does not exceed $1,000,000. Sets forth procedures for approving projects that exceed the 25 percent estimated cost provision, and exempts from such procedures any project which has an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform construction design services for construction projects in support of national security programs. Directs the Secretary to notify the appropriate congressional committees in writing of specific cost overruns. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Secretary of Energy to prescribe regulations prohibiting the dissemination of specific information concerning atomic energy defense programs which could have a significant adverse affect on the health, safety, and security of the public. Directs the Secretary to prepare a quarterly report detailing the application of such guidelines. Limits the preparation of environmental impact statements by the Department of Energy (except those already in preparation) to projects for which such impact statements are required by law. Requires the Secretary to notify the congressional armed services committees whenever the cost of such a statement shall exceed $500,000. Directs the President to report to the appropriate committees of Congress by January 31, 1983, on plans for the permanent disposal of high-level and transuranic wastes resulting from atomic energy defense activities."
