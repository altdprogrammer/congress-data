Appropriates to the Trust Fund for each fiscal year 25 percent of the revenues from the windfall profit tax for such year. Limits the aggregate amount appropriated to the Trust Fund to $50,000,000,000 for all fiscal years. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Trust Fund amounts so appropriated at least quarterly. Creates a Board of Trustees to hold and manage the Trust Fund and report to Congress annually on the operation of the Trust Fund and whenever the Trust Fund amount is too small. Sets forth requirements for investment by the Trust Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in federally guaranteed obligations. Directs the Secretary to transfer from the Trust Fund to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund such amounts as may be provided by appropriation Acts."
