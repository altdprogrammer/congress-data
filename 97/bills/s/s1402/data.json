    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 97-298) Uniform Motor Vehicle Standards Act of 1981 - Prohibits a State from establishing or enforcing, on qualified segments of Federal-aid highways, any regulation of commerce that: (1) imposes a limitation of less than 48 feet on the length of the semitrailer unit operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer combination, and of less than 28 feet on certain trailers and semitrailers; (2) sets an overall length limitation on tractor-trailer trucks and combinations; and (3) prohibits combinations consisting of a truck tractor and two trailing units. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish rules to implement the provisions of this Act. Allows a State to permit trucks or combinations thereof not more than 102 inches wide to operate over qualified Federal-aid highways. Directs that such length and width limitations are exclusive of specified safety-related appendages. Prohibits a State from enacting or enforcing any law that denies reasonable access to motor vehicles subject to this Act to and from the Interstate Highway System and the Federal-aid primary system. Directs the Secretary of Transportation or, upon request, the Attorney General, to institute a civil action for injunctive relief as may be appropriate to assure compliance with the provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary to require all tractors, semitrailers, and trailers subject to this Act to be equipped with approved splash and spray suppressant devices. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the potential benefits and costs that may be anticipated from the establishment of a National intercity truck route network for the operation of a special class of longer combination commercial motor vehicles."
