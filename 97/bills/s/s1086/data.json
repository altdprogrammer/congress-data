    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-386) Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 - Revises the Older Americans Act of 1965 (\"the Act\") and other specified Acts. Amends title I of the Act (Declaration of Objectives and Definitions) to add education and training opportunities for older persons as objectives of the Act. Includes the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under the definition of \"State\" for purposes of the Act. Makes the definitions of \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribal organizations\" inapplicable for purposes of provisions for grants to Indian tribes. Amends title II of the Act (Administration on Aging) to include among the functions of the Commissioner on Aging the coordination of Federal activities with respect to the collection, preparation, and dissemination of information relevant to older individuals. Eliminates the qualification that private organizations be nonprofit in order to receive specified assistance from the Commissioner to plan, develop, and operate programs for the elderly. Includes programs under title I of the Higher Education Act (Continuing Postsecondary Education Program and Planning) and under the Adult Education Act among those programs related to the purposes of the Act, for purposes of Federal agency consultation. Eliminates the National Information and Resource Clearing House for the Aged. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 for the Federal Council on Aging. Eliminates outdated provisions relating to a report on legal services programs. Makes technical and conforming amendments. Amends title III of the Act (Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging) to authorize the Commissioner on Aging to require the technical assistance and cooperation of the Department of Education in carrying out title III. Defines \"education and training service\" for purposes of title III. Adds specified types of boarding homes to the definition of long-term care facility for purposes of the nursing home ombudsman program. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 for title III grants. Specifies separate amounts of such appropriations for: (1) senior centers and supportive services programs; (2) congregate nutrition programs; and (3) home-delivered meal programs. Continues through fiscal year 1984 formulas for allotments to States and determination of the Federal share of the cost of such programs. Makes available from each State grant allotment such amount as the State agency determines to be adequate for conducting an effective ombudsman program. Permits a State which had previously functioned as a single planning and service area to designate additional planning and service areas within the State to be administered by area agencies on aging. Revises requirements for area plans to permit such plans to cover periods of two, three, or four years.

Permits tribal organizations to use nutritional services funds for social services whenever the need for nutritional services is already met from other sources. Makes legal or ombudsman services to older Indians a permissible, rather than a required, service.
