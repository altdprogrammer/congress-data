Sets forth criminal penalties for the use or sale of fraudulent certificates with the intent or knowledge that such certificates will be used in connection with a violation of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Provides criminal penalties for any person who: (1) while navigating an aircraft, knowingly and willfully violates such Act; and (2) is the owner of an aircraft and knowingly allows any person to use such aircraft in violation of such Act. Requires that such penalties shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other penalty imposed under such Act."
