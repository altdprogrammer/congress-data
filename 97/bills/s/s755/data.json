Rept. 97-145) Comprehensive Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of 1981 - Title I: Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation - Amends the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 to replace the current State formula grant framework, including the requirements of a single State administrative agency and State plan, with a technical assistance program for the purposes of: (1) data collection; (2) program management; (3) personnel and facility certification or licensure; (4) compliance monitoring; and (5) the elimination of exclusions in health insurance coverage based on alcohol abuse. Extends the grant program for implementation of the Uniform Alcoholism and Intoxication Treatment Act through fiscal year 1982. Places special emphasis on new treatment and rehabilitation methods as priorities for alcoholism prevention grants and contracts. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give special consideration to programs for minorities, elderly women, youth, handicapped individuals, and the families of alcoholics. Prohibits such grants: (1) to a State or State entity without authorization of the chief executive officer; (2) from exceeding five years in duration; and (3) from exceeding specified percentages of a project's cost per year. Permits such grants to be used to combat drug abuse. Authorizes specified appropriations for such grants for fiscal year 1982. Obligates at least 25 percent of such funds for drug and alcohol abuse prevention. Authorizes specified appropriations for alcohol abuse research for fiscal year 1982. Title II: Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation - Amends the Drug Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act to eliminate the current State formula grant framework. Replaces the current special grant program with a block grant program and contracts for the demonstration of new prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. Permits such grants to be used to combat alcohol abuse. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal year 1982. Obligates at least 25 percent of such funds for prevention purposes. Directs the Secretary to give special consideration to programs for minorities, elderly women, youth, handicapped individuals, and the families of drug abusers. Prohibits such grants under conditions similar to title I grants. Includes prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation within the scope of drug research grants. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal year 1982."
