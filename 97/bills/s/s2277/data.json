Limits the dollar amount of such credit to $5,400. Provides a three year carryback of excess credit amounts. Specifies that such credit shall be available with respect to only one residence of the taxpayer. Requires the recapture of credit amounts for the purchase of a principal residence if such residence is sold within 36 months after the date of acquisition. Repeals the provision allowing all-savers tax-exempt certificates, effective March 31, 1982. Revises requirements for mortgage subsidy bonds."
