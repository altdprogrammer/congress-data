Provides that benefits paid pursuant to such election shall be considered overpayments if the decision on appeal affirms the determination that the individual involved is no longer entitled to benefits. Prohibits such an election in any case where: (1) the individual fails to furnish information with respect to his or her disabiliity or to comply with requirements under title II; (2) benefit termination is based on a finding that the individual can engage in substantial gainful activity; or (3) the individual's claim for continuation of benefits is patently nonmeritorious and without substantial evidence to support the claim."
