    "text": "Acid Deposition Control Act - Amends title I of the Clean Air Act (Air Pollution Prevention and Control) to establish a new program (Interstate Transport and Acid Precursor Reduction) to: (1) regulate the long-range transport of pollutants and their transformation products; and (2) reduce acid compounds, and their precursors, in the atmosphere. Establishes a long-range transport corridor, the \"acid deposition impact region,\" consisting of 31 States (east of or bordering the Mississippi River) and the District of Columbia. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) conduct a study of air pollution problems associated with the long-range transport of pollutants in the portions of the continental United States not included in the acid deposition impact region; and (2) report the results to Congress within two years. Prohibits the increase of emissions of sulfur dioxide and of oxides of nitrogen from stationary sources in the acid deposition impact region over such total actual emissions there as of January 1, 1981. Prohibits any major stationary source in the region from significantly increasing such emissions, unless a not otherwise required net reduction of such regional pollution, in excess of the proposed increase, has been identified. Requires a ten-year phased reduction in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide in the region of 10,000,000 tons from the total 1980 level. Requires each State to achieve reductions in annual sulfur dioxide emissions according to a formula based on each State's share of utility emissions in the region. Permits State Governors to agree to reallot the required reductions. Requires each State in the region to adopt, within two years, enforcement measures to achieve such reduction. Directs the Administrator to approve such measures within four months if specified criteria are met. Sets forth a uniform sulfur dioxide emission limit for fossil-fuel-burning electric generating facilities (which are major stationary sources not subject to new performance standards) in any State that has not adopted, or has not had approved, such enforcement measures by such deadlines. Requires that owners or operators of such sources: (1) submit an approvable reduction plan and schedule within three years of enactment of this Act; (2) comply with such plan and schedule; and (3) achieve the required emission reduction at the earliest practicable date, but no later than ten years after enactment of this Act. Specifies methods or programs for enforceable net emission reduction that may be used by a State or the owner or operator of a source. Permits a State or owner or operator to substitute reduction in emissions of oxides of nitrogen for required sulfur dioxide emissions reductions, at a specified rate. Adds to State implementation plan requirements a prohibition of stationary source air pollutant emissions in amounts that will contribute to atmospheric loadings of pollutants or their transformation products so as to adversely affect public health or welfare or the environment in any other State or foreign country."
