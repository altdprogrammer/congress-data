    "text": "Motor Vehicle Tax Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the manufacturers excise tax on trucks, buses, and tractors and parts and accessories for such vehicles. Imposes upon the first retail sale of such articles a tax based on their wholesale price. Defines \"wholesale price\" as 90 percent of the actual retail selling price in the case of trucks, buses, and tractors and 75 percent of such price in the case of related parts or accessories. Exempts from the tax, articles on which the manufacturers excise tax was paid. Deems as sold, for purposes of the tax imposed by this Act, articles used by a manufacturer, producer, or importer other than in the production of articles otherwise taxable under this Act. Exempts from the tax, sales for export or to a State or local government or nonprofit educational organization if such uses are to occur before any other use. Relieves retailers from liability for the tax upon certification by the purchaser that the article will be used in accordance with applicable provisions of law. Imposes registration requirements upon the parties to tax-free sales. Exempts from the manufacturers excise tax on tires, tubes, and tread rubber, articles sold for use on articles subject to the retailers excise tax imposed by this Act."
