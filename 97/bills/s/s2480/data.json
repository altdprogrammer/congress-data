    "text": "Food Stamp Cost Reduction Act of 1982 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to require that eligible households be charged for food stamp allotments issued to them. Exempts from such charge: (1) households that contain a member who is 60 years of age or over, or who is receiving supplemental security income benefits or disability payments under the Social Security Act; and (2) households with income less than $30 per month for a family of four. Establishes a separate account in the Treasury for the deposit of funds derived from such charges. Requires States to institute procedures under which an eligible household may have charges for allotments deducted from payments received under title IV of the Social Security Act (Aid and Services to Needy Families with Children). Requires a State agency to deposit into the separate account sums derived from negligence or fraud on the part of the agency. Requires that appropriations in excess of the charges paid by eligible households be deposited into the account. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make cost adjustments in the thrifty food plan to reflect the age and sex of the members of an eligible household. Includes energy assistance payments as household income. Revises employment requirements for persons making application for food stamp benefits based upon such person's recent history of employment or receipt of State unemployment compensation. Exempts from such requirements: (1) persons under 18 or over 59 years of age; (2) persons certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment by a physician; (3) an unmarried parent or other household member responsible for the care of a child under 6 years of age or an incapacitated person; or (4) a married parent or other caretaker of a child under 6 years of age in a household in which the other parent is otherwise exempt from employment requirements. Sets forth a formula for the reduction of allotments in households containing members participating in the national school lunch program. Authorizes a State to elect to operate a low-income nutritional assistance block grant program to finance expenditures for food assistance for needy persons. Directs the Secretary to provide such States with a block grant in an amount based on a percentage of the FY 1983 funds appropriated for the food stamp program. Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of an Indian tribe or tribal organization within a block grant State, to reserve a determined amount of such grant for the direct use of such tribe. Sets forth procedures for application and requirements for eligibility for block grants. Prohibits the use of such grants for construction. Sets forth procedures for the Secretary and the Comptroller General to assure compliance with this program."
