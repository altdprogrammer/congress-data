Prohibits a political subdivision of a State from regulating the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device. Permits a State to request previously submitted (in support of a Federal registration) health and safety data for its own review from either the applicant or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Permits a State to require additional data when there are special local concerns about increased environmental risk or pesticide ineffectiveness. Authorizes: (1) the applicant to contest such request through the EPA; and (2) the EPA to modify or overrule such State request. Subjects State and EPA determinations to judicial review in U.S. district courts. Makes other State data requests subject to EPA review. Requires States to review a registration application within 60 days or such application shall be considered approved. Gives States up to 120 days to review an application for a pesticide used in the commercial production of food crops if a new use or active ingredient is involved."
