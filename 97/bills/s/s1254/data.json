    "date": "1981-05-21", 
    "text": "Child Nutrition Amendments of 1981 - Amends the National School Lunch Act to reduce the national average lunch payment from ten cents to nine cents. Sets forth the special assistance factor for free and reduced lunches and provides for an annual adjustment (previously semi-annual) to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to make changes in the school breakfast program to correspond to amendments made for the school lunch program. Eliminates the provision authorizing payment of 100 percent of the cost of operating the breakfast program for schools in severe need. Reduces the level of commodity assistance for lunches. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe changes as may be necessary in the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to achieve cost savings without endangering the nutritional integrity of the child feeding programs. Revises income eligibility criteria for free and reduced lunches to provide that: (1) guidelines for determining eligibility for free lunches shall be 30 percent above the poverty guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), except that beginning July 1, 1983, such guidelines shall be the same as those prescribed for participation in the food stamp program; and (2) that such guidelines for reduced lunches shall be 85 percent above the poverty guidelines prescribed by OMB. Sets forth procedures for local school authorities in determining eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches. Eliminates provisions of the National School Lunch Act which prohibit school authorities from physically segregating or overtly identifying students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Directs the Secretary to conduct a pilot study to verify data submitted on applications for such lunches, and to require that all application forms contain the social security numbers of all adult members of the household. Revises State revenue matching requirements to: (1) require State revenues for school food service to equal 30 percent of those provided by the Secretary for the school lunch program; and (2) declare that the purpose of such funds is to assist schools in obtaining agricultural commodities, rather than having the Secretary supply such commodities. Provides that States are not required to match funds granted to private schools if by law such States do not disburse funds to such schools. Authorizes direct disbursements to certain schools without the matching funds requirement. Terminates food service equipment assistance for the school lunch and breakfast programs. Makes the special milk program authorized by such Act available to educational institutions which do not participate in other food service programs. Prohibits private schools whose tuition exceeds a specified level from participation in food service programs. Terminates summer food service programs under the National School Lunch Act. Makes numerous revisions to the child care food program to reduce certain subsidies. Authorizes certain States to assume administration of any program under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to withhold and disburse funds payable to a State for purposes of providing funds to schools, but only to that extent, if the Secretary has done so since October 1, 1980. Requires students in junior high school or middle schools participating in the school lunch program to accept food whether or not such foods will be consumed. Eliminates the requirement for State educational agencies to submit a plan of child nutrition operations to the Secretary as a prerequisite for Federal funds. Makes residential child care centers ineligible as schools under the National School Lunch Act. Provides that commodity only schools shall be eligible to receive donated foods and special assistance payments in furtherance of such a school's nonprofit lunch program. Authorizes States to carryover unused funds received under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 for any fiscal year to the next fiscal year. Requires States to match appropriated funds received under the special supplemental food program for any amounts received after fiscal year 1981 which exceed such amounts received during fiscal year 1981. Sets forth circumstances under which States will be exempted from such requirement. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to conform to provisions of this Act. Grants to the Secretary the authority to adjust and settle claims arising under provisions of this Act."
