    "text": "Blood Assurance Act of 1980 - Prohibits any person from: (1) charging or collecting a fee; or (2) requiring the donation or transfer of blood, as a condition to supplying blood. Stipulates that a blood supplier may recruit donors by offering incentives such as a discount on the charge to an individual for the provision of blood as a result of a blood donation or blood drive, but limits such discount to the greater of: (1) the average cost of recruiting a donor in the area; or (2) 20 percent of the cost of processing a unit of blood. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to repeal the provision which requires a reduction of the amount payable to a provider of services by a deduction equal to the cost of the first three pints of whole blood. Requires the regulations which determine the cost of services under such program to take into account the processing fees incurred by a provider of services in the replacement of blood furnished to an individual. Prohibits any person from denying to any health care facility or blood supplier the reciprocal exchange of available required blood, unless such exchange would deplete the available blood needed by such establishment. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through a recognized private entity composed in part of national blood suppliers, to: (1) foster the exchange and availability of blood; and (2) determine the fair and reasonable exchange rates to be charged among blood suppliers. Directs the Secretary to suspend or revoke the license of any person licensed under the Public Health Service Act to prepare blood who violates provisions of this Act. Makes a provider of services who violates this Act ineligible to receive Medicare payments. Directs the Secretary: (1) to carry out health education programs regarding the nature of, and need for, blood and blood donors; and (2) to submit a report to Congress within two years."
