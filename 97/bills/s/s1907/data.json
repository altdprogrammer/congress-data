Extends the current reporting requirement to include persons attempting to transport monetary instruments into or from the United States. Raises from $5,000 to $10,000 the amount transported which triggers the reporting requirement. Revises the forfeiture provision to subject monetary instruments to seizure only if the person required to file a report knowingly fails to do so. Authorizes a customs officer to make a warrantless search and seizure of any vehicle, vessel, aircraft, envelope, or other container based on reasonable cause that a monetary instrument is being transported for which a report is required. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay a reward for original information leading to a recovery of at least $50,000 by way of criminal fine, civil penalty, or forfeiture."
