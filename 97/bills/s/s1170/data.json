    "text": "Energy Conservation Assistance Amendments of 1981 - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to repeal references to State school facilities agencies and State hospital facilities agencies. Authorizes (currently requires) the Secretary of Energy to terminate and recover the remaining financial assistance for State, school, and hospital energy conservation projects which are not in compliance with the State plan. Authorizes the Secretary to allocate less than the current mandatory percentage of State technical assistance funds to schools or hospitals. Authorizes appropriations for energy conservation project grants to schools and hospitals for fiscal years 1982-1984. Revises the method by which such appropriations are allocated among the States. Amends the Energy Conservation and Policy Act to replace the technical assistance program with energy conservation project grants for energy conservation measures for buildings owned by local government units and public care institutions. Directs the Secretary of Energy to prescribe criteria for determining which local government units and public care institutions may be classified as being in a hardship class. Authorizes the use of energy conservation project grants to pay up to 90 percent of the costs of an energy conservation project if such project meets the hardship criteria. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate and recover the remaining financial assistance for any local government unit or public care institution which is not in compliance with its application for an energy conservation project grant. Authorizes appropriations for grants to States for energy audits and energy conservation projects for fiscal years 1982-1984. Revises the method of allocating such grants among the States."
