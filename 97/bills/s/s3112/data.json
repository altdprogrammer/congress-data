Authorizes the Director to: (1) appoint ad hoc juries of artists and art experts to assist in the selection of visual works of art; (2) select works of art with such juries' assistance; (3) provide for their safety; (4) make them available for loan to Federal supervisory authorities and to museums; (5) require those who receive fellowships in the visual arts from the Endowment to donate one of their works to the Art Bank; and (6) sponsor exhibitions. Requires the Director, when selecting work for purchase, to consider the quality of the work and the need to encourage unknown and geographically disparate artists. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984-1986."
