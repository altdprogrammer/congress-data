    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendment, S. Rept. 97-84) Peace Corps Autonomy Act - Requires the Peace Corps to be an independent agency within the Executive branch. Transfers to the Director of the Peace Corps all functions relating to the Peace Corps which were vested in the Director of the Action agency. Provides for the transfer of personnel, contracts, property records, and funds used primarily by the Peace Corps to the Peace Corps. Prohibits the transfer of personnel from causing a loss of employee benefits for such personnel for a specified period of time. Requires transferred personnel to be assigned to functions and units related to their assignments before enactment. Requires collective bargaining agreements covering Peace Corps personnel or transferred personnel to continue to be recognized by the Peace Corps. Requires each person employed primarily in connection with any function relating to the Peace Corps who does not hold a Foreign Service appointment to be appointed a member of the Foreign Service, except that: (1) for three years no person currently holding a career or career-conditional appointment shall be appointed a member of the Foreign Service without such person's consent; and (2) each transferred person who held an appointment below a specified grade level shall be appointed a member of the Foreign Service for the duration of operations under the Peace Corps Act (thus, not subject to such Act's five year appointment limitation). Authorizes the President to delegate the authority to carry out such Act only to the Director of the Peace Corps. Amends the Peace Corps Act to delete certain provisions relating to readjustment allowance payments to Peace Corps volunteers. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Comptroller General to submit reports to the appropriate Congressional committees on the implementation of this Act."
