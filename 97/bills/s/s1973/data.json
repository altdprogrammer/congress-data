    "text": "Great Lakes Protection Act of 1981 - Amends the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978 to redesignate specified provisions and to revise definitions under such Act. Establishes a Great Lakes Protection program under such Act. Directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish within NOAA a Great Lakes Research Office, to be directed by an Executive Director appointed by the Administrator. Requires the Executive Director to compile, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, an inventory of all major actions of the Federal, State, and local governments since 1977 which have significantly affected (or may so affect) the Great Lakes. Requires that such inventory be submitted to the Congress and the President and be updated at least once every three months. Requires that, within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, the Executive Director report to the President and the Congress, together with recommendations for improvement and coordination, on: (1) the current state of Federal efforts to improve the Great Lakes' environmental quality; and (2) the degree of coordination among the States to preserve and protect such quality. Sets forth other responsibilities of the Executive Director. Requires that all Federal agencies prepare Great Lakes environmental impact analyses in their recommendations or reports for major Federal actions significantly affecting the Great Lakes. Sets forth provisions relating to such analyses, including a requirement that copies be available to the President and to the public. Directs that, to the fullest extent practicable: (1) U.S. policies, regulations, and public laws be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies of protection for the Great Lakes set forth in this Act; and (2) any major Federal action significantly affecting the Great Lakes be modified to accommodate such policies and include all possible planning to minimize harm to the Great Lakes. Revises provisions relating to interagency cooperation, dissemination of information, and effect on other laws. Extends through fiscal year 1984 the authorization of appropriations to carry out the National Ocean Pollution Planning Act of 1978. Reserves a specified amount of such appropriations to be obligated and expended on the Great Lakes Research Office in each fiscal year ending after September 30, 1981."
