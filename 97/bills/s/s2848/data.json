Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to permit a revision of such budget resolution during the two-year fiscal period after approval by a three-fifths vote of each House of Congress. Amends the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, to require the President to transmit to Congress during the first fifteen days of the first regular session of each Congress the Budget for the two-fiscal-year period beginning on October 1 of the year in which such session occurs. Requires such budget to include projections for the ensuing two-fiscal-year period and the four fiscal years immediately following it. Sets forth the effective dates for the amendments made by this Act."
