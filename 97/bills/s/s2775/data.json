    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-07-26", 
    "text": "Energy and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make block grants to States to enable them to provide emergency assistance (temporary financial assistance or food, clothing, or shelter and emergency medical care or social services) to low-income households in addition to home energy assistance. Reduces the authorization of appropriations for FY 1983 and 1984 for block grants under such Act. Revises the method for determining the State and territory allotments to be made under the block grant program. Permits States to transfer up to ten percent of their allotments under such program for any fiscal year to support activities under other block grant programs. (Currently, States may transfer up to ten percent of their allotments to support specified community service and health care activities.) Requires States desiring to receive allotments for any fiscal year to prepare a report on the intended use of the block grant which shall be reviewed by the Secretary on a limited basis. Requires that such a report be made public within a State on a timely basis for comment and review. Eliminates the requirement that States reserve funds for energy crisis intervention from the block grants available to them. Requires that States make payments from the block grants available to them to low-income households as defined by the States. Eliminates specified requirements with which States must comply in order to receive their allotments. Requires States to conduct biennially financial and compliance audits of their expenditures of the block grants received by them. (Currently, such audits must be prepared at least annually.) Eliminates grant expenditures evaluations by the Comptroller General and restrictions on the allocation of block grants by the States. Repeals the Secretary's authority to restrict the amount available to a State from the block grant received in a prior fiscal year. Provides that programs and activities funded in whole or in part with funds made available under the low-income energy and emergency assistance program shall be considered to be receiving Federal financial assistance for purposes of the laws against discrimination. Requires each State to make reports at least annually on its activities under such program and make such reports available for public inspection within the State."
