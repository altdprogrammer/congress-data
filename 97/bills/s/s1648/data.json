    "text": "Entitles a former spouse of a member or former member of the uniformed services to an annuity based upon the number of years they were married during the creditable service of the member. Terminates the right to the annuity if the spouse remarries before reaching 60, when the member or former member dies, or if the spouse elects to receive a Government annuity based upon a marriage to someone else. Reduces the retired or retainer pay of the member or former member by the amount of the former spouse's annuity. Grants precedence to a court order, spousal agreement, or State law covering the disposition of such rights. Amends the Survivor Benefit Plan to set forth the options and documentation required to participate in the Plan, consistent with the intent of this Act. Limits the total amount of annuities for a surviving or former spouse to 55 percent of the member or former member's retired or retainer pay. Recomputes a member's or former member's retired or retainer pay if the former spouse remarries before reaching 60 or predeceases the member. Sets forth the monthly annuities for a widow or widower, a widow or widower if there is also a surviving former spouse, a surviving former spouse if there is also a widow or widower, and a dependent child."
