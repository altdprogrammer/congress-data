    "date": "1982-09-30", 
    "text": "Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, to allow transportation of merchandise during a three-year period between points within the continental United States, including Alaska, in any vessel engaged in such service on September 1, 1982, which involved transportation, in part, over Canadian rail lines. Allows documented foreign-built vessels used in the processing or assembly of fishery products to transport merchandise which is directly fisheries-related between points in the United States. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress, within one year of enactment of this Act, on measures necessary to improve marine transportation to, from, and within Alaska. Repeals provisions of this Act on January 1, 1986, and reamends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, as of such date, to read the way it reads on the day before enactment of this Act."
