    "text": "White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine which allotments of the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota granted to Chippewa Indians, during the period that the United States held such allotments in trust for the allottees, were: (1) tax forfeited, sold or mortgaged without the Secretary's approval; (2) sold or mortgaged by administrators under authority of State courts; or (3) claimed by other parties under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary to publish a list of allotments not meeting such criteria in specified newspapers. Ratifies and confirms such tax forfeiture, sale, mortgage, or other taking of such allotments. Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine, according to certain guidelines, the compensation to be paid to allottees for losses suffered as a result of such ratification and confirmation; (2) notify the allottees of such compensation determinations and the time limits for appealing such determinations; and (3) make a diligent effort to locate compensation recipients to distribute such compensation. Permits the Secretary to declare as forfeited any compensation owed to a recipient who cannot be found after two years and to deposit such amount to the credit of the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians. Bars any court actions contesting the validity of any such tax forfeiture, sale, mortgage, or other taking of allotments, except actions to contest a final decision of the Secretary's determinations under this Act. Directs the Secretary to adopt regulations implementing this Act within 18 months of its effective date. Authorizes appropriations."
