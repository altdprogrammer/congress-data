Directs each agency to forward a copy of each proposed and final significant rule to the appropriate Congressional committee on the same day such rule is sent to the Federal Register for publication. Prohibits any such rule from becoming effective: (1) within 20 days after it is transmitted to such committee; (2) within 60 days of such a transmittal if a committee reports a joint resolution disapproving the rule, unless either House rejects the resolution or Congress adjourns sine die before such period has expired; or (3) if such a joint resolution is enacted into law during such period. Authorizes the head of an agency, upon written notice to the appropriate Congressional committees, to waive the requirements of this Act with respect to a rule upon determining that: (1) the rule is being issued in response to exceptional circumstances requiring immediate agency action in the public interest; or (2) the contents of the rule must be kept confidential prior to the effective date of the rule. Exempts agency compliance from judicial review."
