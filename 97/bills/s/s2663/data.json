    "text": "American Defense Education Act - Establishes a national program to provide incentives to local educational agencies to improve instruction in mathematics, science, communication skills, foreign languages, and new technology. Requires local education agencies which desire to participate in the national program to develop and carry out a program of improvement of instruction and student achievement. Sets forth requirements for such programs. Entitles participating local educational agencies to receive basic payments for each fiscal year equal to two percent of an established payment rate multiplied by the average daily attendance. Entitles agencies which show substantial evidence of meeting program goals to an additional incentive payment equal to two percent of the established payment rate. Sets forth a formula for establishing such payment rate. Sets forth requirements for payment applications for submission to the Secretary of Education. Directs the Secretary to administer the program and to pay each local educational agency with an approved application the amount to which it is entitled for each fiscal year. Provides for a joint survey and report to Congress by the Secretaries of Defense and Education, for each year from 1983 through 1987, on the academic achievement levels of 18-year-old persons in the United States and the personnel training and educational needs of the Armed Forces. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1984 through 1989 to carry out this Act."
