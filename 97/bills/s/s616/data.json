    "text": "Equal Access to Communications Act of 1981 - Title I: Access to Government - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after consultation with specified organizations with special knowledge of the problems of deaf persons, to select at least five Federal agencies with which deaf persons have the greatest need for communication and have installed in each such agency and its regional offices a device which permits two-way communication of textual messages in alphanumeric form by telephone lines. Directs the Secretary to select an additional 100 locations for installation of such devices which shall be available to deaf people for their use in communicating with the agencies selected under this Act and with Members of Congress who choose to install such a device. Directs the Secretary to disseminate information about the availability of such devices as widely as possible to local organizations of the deaf. Directs that at least one employee be available during normal working hours at each location where such devices are located to assist deaf persons in the use of such devices. Authorizes appropriations for the above activities. Authorizes the Secretary to make a grant to any State or local government for installing telecommunications devices for the deaf in government agencies and other locations in a program to be identical to the Federal program established by this Act. Sets the level of such grants at 75 percent of the cost of installing and operating such devices. Authorizes annual continuing grants for such purposes. Requires the Secretary to seek the cooperation of the Administrator of General Services in having transferred to States any telecommunications devices for the deaf categorized as Federal surplus property. Authorizes appropriations for such grant and transferral programs. Requires that any Member of Congress making a written request for a telecommunications device for the deaf be provided with one. Directs the Architect of the Capitol to install such a device at the central switchboard in the United States Capitol. Requires at least one employee trained in the use of such device for the deaf to be available during normal working hours to provide assistance to deaf persons. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress within two years after the installation of the first device under this Act describing the effectiveness of the programs established by this Act and making recommendations on the continuation and expansion of such programs. Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable income tax credit for an amount not to exceed $200 equal to 75 percent of the expenses paid by deaf or speech-impaired individuals for the use of toll telephone service by means of teletypewriters. Allows an income tax deduction for 50 percent of the expenses incurred by blind, deaf, or speech impaired individuals in purchasing or installing a teletypewriter. Limits the amount of such deduction to $200 for each teletypewriter."
