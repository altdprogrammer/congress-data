    "text": "Nuclear Material Export Control Act of 1982 - Title I: Exports of Nuclear Material - Declares that there should be congressional review of the export of commercial materials and technical data that can be used for nuclear weapons or facilities. Directs the President to transmit to the Congress any application for an export license authorizing a sale to a country that has not signed the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: (1) of any material or technology that can be used to build or test nuclear explosive devices; or (2) for the construction of certain nuclear facilities. Prohibits issuing such license until 30 days after the President transmits the application to the Congress and then only if both Houses of Congress do not adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving the issuance of such license. Provides for expedited consideration of such a concurrent resolution."
