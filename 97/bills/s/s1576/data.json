Defines \"qualified small business corporation\" as a small business corporation whose passive investment income, for the taxable year or for any of the three subsequent taxable years, does not exceed 15 percent of its gross receipts. Requires a reduction of the basis of such stock by the amount of gain not recognized. Prescribes a three-year statute of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to gain realized by the sale of such property."
