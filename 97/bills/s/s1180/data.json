    "text": "Inventory Simplification and Reform Tax Act of 1981 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the qualification requirement for the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting that a taxpayer use no inventory method for financial reporting or credit purposes other than the LIFO method. Allows a taxpayer who adopts the LIFO method to spread increases in taxable income attributable to such change over a ten-year period. Allows an election by small businesses which use the dollar method of pricing inventories under the LIFO method and which have average annual receipts of $5,000,000 or less for the three taxable years ending with the year of election to use one inventory pool for any trade or business. Permits a wholesaler or retailer who uses such method to elect the use of inventory pools based on the applicable Government price index categories for all items of inventory. Allows the use of such index categories in the pricing of inventories under such dollar-value methods. Allows an election to use a link chain or index method to compute the LIFO value of dollar-value pool without regard to suitability or practicality of any other method. Repeals the requirement, with respect to liquidation plans adopted after December 31, 1981, that a corporation inventorying goods under the LIFO method treat the LIFO recapture amount with respect to distributed inventory assets as gain from the sale of such assets. Allows an election by small businesses which are at least half-owned by active participants in the trade or business and which have average annual gross receipts of $1,500,000 or less for the three taxable years ending with the year of election to use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting without regard to any inventory requirements."
