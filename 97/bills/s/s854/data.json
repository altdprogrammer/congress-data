Permits the Secretary to authorize the Director of such Office to: (1) assist Federal, State and municipal agencies to ascertain the benefits due a foreign mission; (2) provide benefits for or on behalf of a foreign mission; and (3) support the secure and efficient operation of foreign missions. Authorizes the Secretary to require a foreign mission to obtain benefits from the Director on terms approved by the Secretary or to comply with certain terms, including paying the Director a fee and waiving any recourse against any government authority or employee, as a condition to the performance in the United States of any contract, the acquisition of any real property, or the application for or acceptance of any benefit, if the Secretary determines such actions are necessary to: (1) facilitate relations between the U.S. and a sending state (a state represented by such mission); (2) protect U.S. interests; (3) adjust for costs and procedures of obtaining benefits for U.S. missions abroad; or (4) assist in resolving a dispute affecting U.S. interests. Authorizes the Secretary to designate a State Department official as an agent of a foreign mission to effectuate a waiver of recourse. Prohibits a specified section of this Act from being deemed to limit the authority of the U.S. Secret Service to provide protection for such missions. Authorizes the Secretary to require any foreign mission to: (1) notify the Director before such mission acquires or disposes of any real property; and (2) divest itself of or forgo the use of any real property acquired without notice to the Director or exceeding the limits placed on real property available to U.S. missions in the sending state. Authorizes the Secretary to protect and dispose of any property of a foreign mission which has ceased conducting governmental activities and has not designated a protecting power. Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to preempt any act of a Federal agency or of a State or municipal government. Requires substantial weight to be given to the recommendations of the Secretary or the Director on the Federal interest in State or local proceedings involving granting benefits to foreign missions. Provides for the administration and management of the Office of Foreign Missions. Makes the provisions of this Act applicable to public international oranizations. Prohibits compliance with this Act by a foreign mission from being deemed a waiver of any immunity. Prohibits making benefits available to foreign missions contrary to this Act. Grants standing to the United States to bring or intervene in an action to obtain compliance with the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to certify whether a foreign mission is in compliance with such Act. Requires the Secretary to comply with Presidential guidelines for exercising the authorities granted by this Act. Makes the provisions of this Act severable. Amends the Diplomatic Relations Act to extend the privileges and immunities of the Vienna Convention to the missions of non-parties to the Convention. Authorizes the President to determine what privileges and immunities should be extended to a foreign mission."
