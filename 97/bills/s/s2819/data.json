Restores all rights and privileges of the tribe and its members, under any Federal authority, which may have been diminished or lost under specified Federal law. Makes the tribe and its members eligible for all Federal services and benefits furnished to federally recognized Indian tribes, without regard to the existence of, or residence on, a reservation. Provides that, except as specifically provided, nothing in this Act shall alter any property right or obligation, any contractual right or obligation, or any obligation for taxes already levied. Permits the tribe to organize and to adopt a self-governing document. Directs the tribe to file a copy of its self-governing document with the Secretary of the Interior. Provides tribal membership for those on the tribal roll and their descendents. Limits those who may participate in any distribution of funds pursuant to a specified judgment. Authorizes the Secretary to make rules necessary to carry out this Act."
