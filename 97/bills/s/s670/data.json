Directs the Administrator to appoint the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War to consult with him on the administration of benefits to former POW's. Requires that such committee include former POW's of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnamese conflict and individuals who are recognized authorities in specified fields of medicine. Requires the Committee to report biennially to the Administrator on the programs and activities of the Veterans' Administration pertaining to former POW's and assessing the compensation, health-care, and rehabilitation needs of such veterans.
