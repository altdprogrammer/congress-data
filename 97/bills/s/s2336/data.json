    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-961) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 for specified maritime programs of the Department of Transportation, including: (1) operating-differential subsidies; (2) research and development; (3) operations and training; and (4) the acquisition of three C-6 type vessels for the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Authorizes supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in salaries and employee benefits. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to allow, until October 1, 1983, an operator receiving or applying for an operating-differential subsidy to construct, reconstruct, or acquire its vessels of over 5,000 deadweight tons in a foreign shipyard without fiscal year limitation. Prohibits certain liquid and/or dry bulk vessels, during the first three years as documented U.S.-flag vessels, from carrying preference cargoes unless: (1) such a vessel is under three years of age; and (2) no other appropriate bulk vessel is available at fair and reasonable rates for U.S.-flag commercial vessels. Prohibits any vessel constructed, reconstructed, or acquired under such Act from being transferred or placed under the registry or flag of a foreign nation during its useful economic life without the approval of the Secretary of Transportation. Requires that additional limitations on new commitments for vessel construction loan guarantees be set in annual authorization Acts. Prohibits the denial of guarantee eligibility because of vessel type. Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from entering into new commitments to guarantee vessel construction loans in excess of a specified sum during FY 1983. Amends the Bankruptcy Code to permit the Secretary to foreclose on specified vessel mortgages (thus excepting the Secretary, and the Secretary of Commerce, from the provisions of such Act which impose an automatic stay of any foreclosure proceedings). Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to allow the Secretary of Transportation at his option and discretion, to assume the obligations of defaulted Federal ship mortgages. Subjects the Federal Maritime Commission to annual authorization. Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, to prohibit, after December 31, 1983 (or after an appropriate vessel has been constructed and documented), the transportation of hazardous waste by a foreign-flag vessel from a point in the United States for the purpose of incineration at sea. Exempts from this provision any foreign-flag vessel owned by or under construction on May 1, 1982, for a corporation wholly owned by a U.S. citizen. Subjects such vessels to specified inspection requirements. Authorizes the documentation of a named vessel with the privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade."
