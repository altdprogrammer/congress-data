Lists the insurance eligibility requirements for such a mortgage, including requirements that the mortgage shall: (1) be amortized over no more than 30 years; (2) have an actual term of not less than ten nor more than 30 years; (3) include provisions for refinancing the mortgage before the actual term expires; and (4) be executed by a purchaser who has not owned a home during the three previous years and whose income does not exceed 120 percent of the median area income. Directs the Secretary to prescribe consumer protections and disclosure requirements with respect to such mortgages."
