    "text": "Big Sur Coast Area Act - Establishes the Big Sur Coast Area in the State of California. Establishes the Big Sur Coast Area Council to: (1) recommend to the Secretary of Agriculture a comprehensive management plan for the protection and management of the Big Sur Area; (2) facilitate communication and coordination among the governmental agencies that have jurisdiction within the area; and (3) advise the Secretary on the appropriate Federal role in the management of the Big Sur Area. Sets forth the elements to be contained in such comprehensive plan. Requires the Council, in the event that the local coastal programs for the Big Sur Area mandated by the California Coastal Act of 1976 are not certified by the California Coastal Commission by the statutory deadline of July 1, 1981, to recommend a land-use plan and implementation program for the area that shall be in effect until certification of the local coastal programs. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Council any amendments to such plan with an explanation of the reasons for such amendments. Requires the Council to respond to the amendments made by the Secretary and to submit any recommendations for changes. Requires the Secretary to revise the plan in a manner which adequately responds to the recommendations of the Council and to adopt the plan as so revised. Directs the Council to review the plan at least once every five years. Sets forth the administrative responsibilities of the State of California and local governmental authorities having jurisdiction within the Big Sur Area. Withdraws, subject to valid existing rights, all federally owned lands within the area from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws of the United States. Prohibits any timber harvest or other cutting of timber on so much of the Los Padres National Forest as is within the Area except to the extent necessary to control fire, disease, or insect activity. States that the Secretary, with the advice of the Council, shall provide for the administration of the comprehensive management plan and shall ensure that such plan is carried out by all Federal, State, and local agencies. Allows the Secretary to enter into contracts or agreements with State and local agencies, landowners, or private nonprofit organizations in order to provide for the management of the area. Requires any consistency determination submitted to the California Coastal Commission for any development project or plan within or adjacent to the Big Sur Area to include a Council recommendation for concurrence or objection by the Commission. Authorizes the Secretary, until the adoption of the plan, to acquire Council-recommended lands, waters, or interests within the Big Sur Area and other interests determined by the Secretary to have critical ecological or scenic values which are in immediate danger of being adversely affected. Sets forth the authorities of the Secretary with respect to land acquisition after the plan has been adopted. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to State, local governments, and private or other public entities for the acquisition of interests within the area. Permits the Secretary to convey property acquired pursuant to this Act to State or local authorities in accordance with the management plan. Permits the Secretary to sell or lease back lands purchased within the area to the original owner of such lands subject to use restrictions consistent with this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring private property within the area by condemnation except if such acquisition is required to: (1) provide for public access and recreation use as specified by the management plan; (2) prevent new uses which would be incompatible with such plan; or (3) reclaim lands on which new uses have been initiated. Prohibits the Secretary from acquiring without the consent of the owner any structure approved pursuant to State and local law on which construction was initiated prior to July 1, 1980. Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer any lands under such Secretary's jurisdiction within the Big Sur Area whenever such lands exceed the needs of the Department of Defense. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect or in any way diminish the authority of the California Department of Fish and Game or the California Fish and Game Commission to regulate the fish and wildlife resources of the State in the Big Sur Area. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
