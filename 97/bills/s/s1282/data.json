Repeals the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to make such additional payments to counties wherein lands were acquired for addition to the National Park System or National Forest Wilderness Areas. Lists additional revenue-sharing programs for which the Governor of a State shall report to the Secretary on the amount of any such payments received that are transferred to its units of local government. Includes lands administered by the Secretary through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as entitlement lands. Makes technical amendments to the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act to conform to provisions of this Act."
