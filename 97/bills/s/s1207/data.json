    "as": "Indefinitely postponed in Senate", 
    "date": "1982-03-30", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 2330 passed in lieu) Title I: Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Years 1982 and 1983 - Authorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for fiscal years 1982 and 1983, and allocates the funds for: (1) nuclear reactor regulation, including licensing review work for a fast breeder reactor plant project and gas-cooled thermal reactor preapplication review; (2) inspection and enforcement, including the Nuclear Data Link System; (3) nuclear material safety and safeguards; (4) nuclear regulatory research, including fast breeder reactor safety research, gas-cooled thermal reactor safety research, and the Loss of Fluid Test Facility research program; (5) program technical support; and (6) program direction and administration. Limits the NRC's authority to enter into grants and cooperative agreements with universities to not more than one percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated for nuclear regulatory research. Prohibits the NRC from reprogramming the funds authorized to be appropriated for any activity under this Act by an increase or decrease in excess of $500,000 for a period of 30 calendar days after notice of such action has been sent to the appropriate Congressional committees, unless each committee has transmitted a written notice that it has no objection to such action. Authorizes the NRC to retain monies received for cooperative nuclear research programs for salaries and expenses for such programs and to transfer sums from the amounts appropriated under this Act to other government agencies which perform the work for which such appropriations were made. Authorizes payments under this Act only to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Requires the NRC to fund a technical review and analysis of research results obtained from the Loss of Fluid Test Facility research program. Requires the NRC to use funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act to expedite the establishment of safety goals for nuclear reactor regulation. Title II: Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the NRC to issue to a nuclear powerplant an interim operating license, which authorizes fuel loading, testing, and operation of the powerplant, pending final NRC action on the operating license application. Limits the power levels at which a nuclear powerplant may operate under such an interim operating license. Requires a petition for an interim license to be preceded by the filing of: (1) the initial Safety Evaluation Report by the NRC Staff; (2) the NRC staff's first supplement to the report; and (3) a State, local, or utility emergency preparedness plan; as well as, (4) the currently required safety and environmental documents. Removes the requirement that the NRC hold a hearing on a petition for an interim operating license after ten days notice and publication once in the Federal Register. Permits the NRC to issue an interim license or an amendment thereto upon finding that: (1) all legal requirements, except a required hearing, are met; (2) there will be adequate protection of public health and safety and the environment during the period of interim operation; and (3) denial of an interim license will result in a delay in the operation of the powerplant. Requires that a final order for the issuance of an interim license be transmitted to specified congressional committees. Makes such final orders subject to judicial review. Requires the parties to the final operating license application hearing to notify the NRC of any violations of an interim operating license or any dangers to the public health and safety and the environment during interim operation. Directs the NRC to minimize the issuance of interim licenses. Terminates the NRC's authority to issue interim licenses on December 31, 1983. Authorizes the NRC to issue, and make immediately effective, license amendments which involve no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding a request for a hearing. Subjects to criminal penalties any person who intentionally and willfully disrupts or attempts to disrupt the normal operation of any licensed nuclear facility. Requires the Secretary of Energy to prescribe regulations and issue orders to prohibit the unauthorized dissemination of certain unclassified information with respect to atomic energy defense programs. Makes determinations by the Secretary concerning the applicability of such prohibition subject to judicial review. Requires the Secretary to report quarterly on the application of such regulations or orders. Makes funds appropriated for the NRC's administrative expenses available for reimbursement of NRC resident inspectors' relocation expenses. Authorizes the use of Government vehicles at resident inspection offices for transportation of resident inspectors between their homes and official duty stations when public transportation is unavailable or impractical. Limits the amount of funds the NRC may use in FY 1982 and 1983 for the reimbursement of resident inspectors' relocation expenses. Revises the dates by which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must promulgate health and environmental safety standards with respect to uranium mill tailings. Requires the Administrator to consider all relevant factors, including health and safety and evironmental risks and economic costs, in establishing such standards. Prohibits the NRC from implementing the Uranium Mill Licensing Requirements until the NRC has promulgated rulemaking procedures relating to the management of by-product material which conform to the health and environmental safety standards promulgated by the Administrator. Authorizes the Administrator to use EPA funds, as necessary, from FY 1981 and 1982 appropriations to ensure that such standards are promulgated within the time specified. Requires the NRC to consider all relevant factors (including health and safety and environmental risks, economic costs, license conditions, and local and regional conditions) in promulgating standards with respect to the management of uranium mill tailings. Directs the NRC to establish criteria for the issuance of licenses for importing source material and special nuclear material that will provide for essential U.S. security interests by ensuring sufficient domestic mining and milling capacity to supply long-term domestic source material requirements. Requires restrictions on the importation of source material and special nuclear material from foreign sources. Requires the NRC to report to Congress annually on licensee compliance with such criteria. Requires States to consider health and safety and environmental risks, economic costs, and local and regional costs in determining whether to adopt Federal standards for the licensing and regulation of uranium mill tailings. Permits States to develop alternative licensing and regulation requirements if Federal requirements cannot be practically applied, so long as the State requirements adequately protect the public health and safety and the environment. Amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 to revise the time period within which: (1) States may exercise authority under State law with respect to uranium mill tailings; and (2) the NRC shall not have licensing authority over uranium mill tailings produced in any activities over which States have assumed authority pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the NRC to exempt the transfer of land in which uranium mill tailings have been used as backfill in underground mines from certain land use disposal requirements. Prohibits the transfer, reprocessing, or use of special nuclear material produced in licensed facilities for nuclear explosive purposes. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the NRC to promulgate regulations for determining whether a license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. Authorizes the NRC to issue an operating license for a nuclear powerplant in the absence of an approved emergency preparedness plan, if there exists an adequate plan for the public health and safety. Requires the NRC to establish and coordinate a monitoring, engineering assessment and remedial action program for the management of uranium mill tailings at offsite locations in the vicinity of the Edgemont, South Dakota, uranium mill site. Amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 to require the Secretary of Energy to designate for remedial action any real property in Edgemont, South Dakota, that is: (1) in the vicinity of the Tennessee Valley Authority uranium mill site; and (2) contaminated with residual radioactive materials from that site. Requires the Secretary to pay the full cost of such remedial action. Directs the NRC to implement and accelerate the resident inspector program so as to assure the assignment of at least one resident inspector, by the end of FY 1982, at each site at which construction of a commercial nuclear powerplant is more than 15 percent complete. Requires the NRC to conduct a study of alternate concepts and existing programs for improving quality assurance and quality control performance in the construction of commercial nuclear powerplants. Requires the NRC to undertake a pilot program to evaluate quality assurance and quality control programs underway. Directs the NRC to report to Congress on the results of the study and the pilot program within 18 months after enactment of this Act."
