    "text": "Amtrak Improvement Act of 1981 - Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to revise the goals of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), to minimize Federal subsidies, and to improve the overall service offered by Amtrak. Repeals provisions of such Act concerning the basic rail passenger system. Revises Amtrak's financing procedures concerning ownership and issuance of common and preferred stock. Repeals the provision requiring the Interstate Commerce Commission to study through routes and joint fares between Amtrak and other intercity common carriers. Declares that Amtrak shall not be required to pay any additional taxes as a result of its expenditures to acquire or improve real property or equipment used in the provision of rail passenger service. Exempts Amtrak from the requirement of any State or local law that specifies the minimum number of crewmembers who must be employed to operate a passenger train. Provides that any discontinuance or reduction of routes, trains, or services made by Amtrak shall not be reviewable in any court except on petition of the Attorney General of the United States. Revises requirements concerning Amtrak's monthly and annual reports to Congress. Allows a railroad or other person to conduct intercity rail passenger service over any route over which Amtrak is performing scheduled service pursuant to a contract. Deletes provisions concerning special or charter train contract operations. Deauthorizes, effective October 1, 1981, Amtrak from operating commuter rail passenger service under agreement with a State. Permits any State or group of States, regional or local agency, or other person to request Amtrak to institute or retain specified rail passenger service. Sets forth assurances that must accompany such request, including certain financial guarantees. Authorizes Amtrak to enter into agreements for the provision of such service. Directs that funds provided by Amtrak for such service shall remain available until expended. Allows such agreements to be renewed every two years. Authorizes Amtrak to continue commuter rail passenger service so long as Amtrak is reimbursed for 100 percent of the available losses of operating such service. Deletes provisions relating to long distance routes, including quadrant routes and the Inter-American train to the Mexican border. Authorizes Amtrak to make necessary changes in the Route and Service Criteria. Repeals provisions prohibiting Amtrak from contracting out any work normally performed by employees in a bargaining unit covered by a contract. Sets forth protective arrangements for Amtrak employees, including moving expenses, insurance coverage, and new career training. Declares that rights afforded to employees under this Act shall be coequal to the rights afforded under the Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act and the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act. Requires Amtrak, beginning in fiscal year 1982, to recover through revenues at least 50 percent of its costs (excluding capital costs). Directs Amtrak to discontinue routes, trains, and services as necessary to comply with such requirement. Requires Amtrak to reduce its management costs by at least ten percent by October 1, 1983. Revises the authorization of appropriations for Amtrak for fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Declares it the intent of Congress to provide incentives to encourage any person to undertake rail passenger service. Exempts such service from regulation (except safety regulations) by the Federal Government. Amends the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 to revise provisions concerning collective bargaining and employee protection agreements. Directs Amtrak, representatives of labor, and the American Association of Railroads to report jointly to Congress regarding their efforts to achieve greater efficiencies in management and labor practices. Amends the Rail Passenger Service Act to revise limits on funding for advertising and promotion of rail service on a local level. Directs Amtrak, within three months of the date of enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the actual and potential problems encountered by Amtrak in entering into agreements regarding direct employment of rail passenger operating personnel."
