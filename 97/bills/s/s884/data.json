    "text": "(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 97-377) Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 - Title I: Dairy - Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act as amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to provide for milk producer initiated marketing order amendment hearings. Extends through 1985: (1) dairy base plan authority; (2) the program of price-supported dairy products for the military and veterans' hospitals; and (3) the dairy indemnity program. Sets milk price supports per hundredweight for fiscal years 1982-1985 at $13.10, $13.25, $14.00, and $14.60, respectively. Establishes price supports for fiscal years 1983-1985 at between 70-75 percent of parity. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to reduce inventories of Commodity Credit Corporation dairy products to reduce outlays to the level used for budgetary purposes under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Directs the Secretary to report to the House and Senate agriculture committees by December 31, 1982, regarding regional food security aspects of the dairy support program and milk marketing orders. Title II: Wool and Mohair - Amends the National Wool Act of 1954 to extend the wool and mohair price support program through 1985. Revises the support level from 85 to 77.5 percent of the formula rate. Title III: Wheat - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide for loans and purchases of the 1982-1985 wheat crops at not less than $3.55 per bushel. Stipulates that the Secretary may adjust levels downward by up to ten percent (but not less than $3.00 per bushel) whenever the yearly price for the previous year is not more than 105 percent of the current loan and purchase level. Requires the Secretary to provide producers with the same return they would have received if such loan reductions occur. Sets minimum target prices for each of these years at $4.05, $4.30, $4.45, and $4.65, respectively. Permits the Secretary to increase prices to reflect increased production costs. Makes prevented planting and disaster payments available for such crop years for producers for whom Federal crop insurance is not available. Authorizes the Secretary to make disaster payments to any wheat producer whose losses can not be alleviated by other assistance and crop insurance programs. Directs the Secretary to proclaim a national program acreage for each of the 1982-1985 wheat crops by not later than August 15 of each year. Sets forth national and individual acreage allocation formulas. Authorizes the Secretary to revise them as necessary. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for either an acreage limitation program or a set-aside program. Provides with regard to the acreage limitation program: (1) for conservation use of unused acreage; (2) that producers who knowingly produce in excess of their limit shall be ineligible for program loans, purchases, and payments; (3) that the Secretary shall announce the program by August 15; and (4) that limitations shall be based on a uniform reduction of planted wheat acreage.
