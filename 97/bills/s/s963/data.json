Penalizes the charging of interest in excess of such rate by forfeiture of the creditor's entire interest in the indebtedness. Makes the provisions of this Act effective with respect to loans made in any State during the period beginning on July 1, 1981, and ending on the earlier of: (1) April 1, 1983; or (2) the date, on or after July 1, 1981, on which a State adopts a law or votes in favor of a referendum rejecting the application of this Act to loans made in such State. Provides for application of this Act to loans made in such a State during the eligibility period but before the adoption of such a law or the passage of such a referendum. States that the provisions of this Act do not apply to any loan secured for a residential manufactured home unless the loan meets specified requirements."
