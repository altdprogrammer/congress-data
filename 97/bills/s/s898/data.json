    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #311 (90-4)) Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1981 - Title I: General - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to declare that such Act applies to, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has jurisdiction over: (1) all interexchange and foreign telecommunications and all radio transmissions originating or received within the United States; (2) the licensing and regulating of all radio stations; and (3) all persons engaged in such telecommunications or radio transmissions within the United States. Exempts from FCC jurisdiction carriers engaged in interexchange (long distance) or foreign telecommunications solely through physical connection with nonaffiliates. Sets forth definitions of terms used in this Act. Directs the FCC to establish a transition plan to foster marketplace competition and to implement deregulation for interexchange telecommunications services, equipment, and carriers. Requires such plan to provide for: (1) classification of carriers; (2) establishment and implementation of an accounting system; (3) the formation of fully separated affiliates and the monitoring of compliance with the requirements of such formation; (4) integrated rates for regulated interexchange telecommunications services; (5) the prevention of unreasonable charges for basic telecommunications services; and (6) practices and procedures for exchange access charges. Title II: Domestic Telecommunications - Directs the FCC to revise, reduce, or eliminate rules with respect to telecommunication services or carriers operating in a competitive market, unless there is an adverse effect on the national security or on the competitiveness of U.S. suppliers or carriers. Grants the FCC continuing authority over regulated telecommunications services and carriers. Authorizes FCC regulation to: (1) deal with cross subsidization and other anticompetitive practices between any fully separated affiliate and the dominant-regulated carrier or its affiliates; and (2) protect users of telecommunications services in connection with dealings between any dominant regulated carrier, its affiliates, and any fully separated affiliate. Permits management personnel of any dominant-regulated carrier to direct operations of such carrier, any affiliate, and any fully separated affiliate as long as the costs of such direction are properly allocated. Directs the FCC to assure that the amendments made by this Act do not result in unreasonable increases in charges for basic telephone service. Prohibits the FCC and any State commission from preventing or limiting, except in specified cases, the use of any technology or improvement for telecommunications services. Denies the FCC the authority to include in radio licenses any condition inconsistent with its own authority over domestic telecommunications. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to collect certain information on foreign and U.S. telecommunications industries. Requires the FCC to identify those carriers which on enactment of this Act: (1) are subject to regulation; and (2) derive revenue from separations and settlements. Classifies such carriers as regulated carriers. Classifies the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) as a dominant-regulated carrier. Authorizes the FCC to classify or reclassify, as a regulated carrier, any carrier which offers interexchange telecommunications services or facilities, if: (1) such services or facilities are not subject to effective competition; (2) Federal regulation of such carrier is required to accomplish the purposes of this Act; and (3) the benefits of such regulation outweigh the costs. Defines effective competition as the presence of a reasonably available alternative. Sets forth factors to be considered in determining whether a reasonably available alternative exists. Requires the FCC to determine which telecommunications services or facilities offered by a newly classified or reclassified regulated carrier are not subject to effective competition. Designates such services as regulated services. Directs the FCC to classify or reclassify as a dominant-regulated carrier any foreign government owned telecommunications carrier and any regulated carrier which is dominant in the provision of regulated telecommunications services in a substantial percentage of the markets. Authorizes the FCC to reclassify any dominant-regulated carrier as a regulated carrier and any regulated carrier as an unregulated carrier. Defines an unregulated carrier as an interexchange carrier not classified as a regulated carrier. Directs the FCC to review carrier classifications once every three years. Prohibits the FCC from regulating the resale of any telecommunications service except resales of regulated telecommunications service by certain foreign entities. Prohibits any carrier from restricting the resale of any regulated service provided by such carrier. Requires the Postal Service, if it offers to operate any telecommunications service to nonaffiliates, to offer such services through a separate entity. Requires such entity to meet specified criteria. States that this Act neither authorizes nor prohibits the electronic delivery of messages to nonaffiliates by the separate entity. Authorizes the entity to conduct business with the Postal Service if specified conditions are met. Authorizes the FCC to regulate the separation of the Postal Service from the entity. Requires the entity to file cost data relating to its telecommunications services with the FCC. Authorizes the FCC to determine the costs for such services. Prohibits the Postal Rate Commission from recommending or fixing a fee below the cost determined by the FCC. Prohibits dominant-regulated carriers, unless authorized by the FCC, from engaging in resale activity except through a fully separated affiliate. Authorizes the FCC to prescribe different requirements for different regulated carriers and to exempt carriers from the requirements of domestic telecommunications regulations. Prohibits the FCC from imposing any requirements on unregulated carriers which are not specifically provided in such domestic telecommunications regulations. Makes a regulated carrier liable for injuries to persons caused by violations of such Act. Requires every telecommunications carrier and the separate entity within the Postal Service to establish, upon request, interconnection of its regulated service with any: (1) telecommunications carrier; (2) telecommunications facility or private telecommunications system; and (3) customer-premises equipment which meets certain standards. Prohibits such carrier and entity from discriminating in an unreasonable or anticompetitive manner with respect to the conditions for interconnection. Authorizes the FCC to specify or approve the rates and conditions for: (1) regulated telecommunications services by regulated carriers to other carriers or to customers of other carriers; (2) interconnection between interexchange and exchange (local) telecommunications services; and (3) interconnection between the regulated telecommunications services of a regulated carrier or an exchange carrier and any private or other telecommunications system and any customer-premises equipment. Authorizes the FCC to prohibit discrimination by regulated or exchange carriers. Exempts from FCC control interconnection required for national security. Requires exchange carriers to offer to all interexchange carriers nondiscriminatory exchange access according to a specified schedule on an unbundled, tariff basis. Authorizes the FCC to waive the duty to provide such exchange access under specified circumstances.
