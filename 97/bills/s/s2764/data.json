    "text": "State Anti-Fraud Mineral Royalty Collection Act of 1982 - Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act to provide that except where there is a State royalty collection program for federal leases, the Secretary of the Interior shall collect all receipts from sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals of public lands under that Act and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Requires: (1) 50 percent of the receipts to go to the State in which the lease is located; (2) 40 percent of the receipts to go into the reclamation fund established by the Reclamation Act of 1902; and (3) ten percent of the receipts to be deposited in the Royalty Collection Administrative Trust Fund established under this Act. Provides that a State, upon its own request, may assume the responsibility of auditing and collecting royalties from leases within the State. Sets forth requirements a State must meet to assume such responsibility. Establishes the Royalty Collection Administrative Trust Fund. States that the fund shall be used only for purposes of the administrative costs of the collection of all moneys due the United States accruing from public lands for the production of minerals under the Act and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970."
