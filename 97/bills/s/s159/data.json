Provides that such land be held in trust by the United States for the Tribe and that specified rights of third parties be preserved. Authorizes the Secretary, after consultation with the governing body of the Tribe, to create easements or rights-of-way across such exchanged lands in order to provide necessary access to adjacent Federal lands. Prohibits such exchange if the value of the lands to be acquired by the United States is more than 125 percent of the value of the lands to be acquired by the Tribe. Provides for the equalization of value of the lands exchanged by monetary payments by the Secretary to the Tribe or by the Tribe to the United States. Authorizes appropriations, as necessary, during FY 1983 for such payments by the Secretary to the Tribe."
