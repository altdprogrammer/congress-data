    "text": "National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1983 - Authorizes appropriations to the National Science Foundation for FY 1983 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences; (5) ocean drilling programs; (6) Antarctic research programs; (7) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (8) program development and management; and (9) science and engineering education. Makes specified funds available for industry/university cooperative projects to promote academic research and education in the basic sciences and engineering. Limits the amount of authorizations which may be used for consultation or expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United states. Permits the transfer of funds among categories. Requires the Director of the Foundation to give the appropriate committees of Congress 30 days notice of any transfers in excess of ten percent of the amounts authorized. Provides that written notice of no objections from the Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources will permit an immediate transfer of funds. Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to require the National Science Board to render periodic rather than annual reports to the President on indicators of the state of science and engineering in the United States. Repeals the requirement that the Director establish a Resource Center for Science and Engineering at an educational institution enrolling a substantial number of minority and/or low-income students. Deletes the requirement that contracting officers of the Foundation report any financial or academic affiliation with a grant applicant. Repeals the prohibition against a Foundation employee's registering a patent in his or her own interest which is related to the subject matter of and made in connection with official duties."
