Requires the application for a wiretap order to state whether surreptitious entries are required. Requires the court order authorizing interception to specify whether surreptitious entries are authorized and, if so, the identity of the agency authorized to make the entries. Allows the interception of communications without a court order in emergency situations involving immediate danger or death or serious injury to any person. (Current law limits it to conspiracies involving national security or organized crime). Requires an authorizing judge to report orders approving surreptitious entries to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts."
