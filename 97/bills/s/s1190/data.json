    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the nonconventional source fuel production income tax credit to any solid fuel in pellet form produced from biomass (other than wood or wood products) which has a Btu content per unit of volume or weight, determined without regard to any nonbiomass elements, which is at least 40 percent greater than the Btu content of the biomass from which it is produced. Requires the taxpayer to elect whether to determine Btu content by volume or by weight. Limits application of such credit to pellets: (1) produced in a facility placed in service between January 1, 1980, and September 30, 1983, or for the construction of which the taxpayer was obligated under a binding contract on September 30, 1983; and (2) sold before January 1, 1990. Extends the time for start up of wood fuel facilities until October 1, 1983, for purposes of the nonconventional source fuel tax credit."
