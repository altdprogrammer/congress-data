    "text": "Energy Productivity Act of 1981 - Title I: Energy Investment Credit - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the energy percentage, for purposes of the investment tax credit, in the case of certain alternative energy property, specially defined energy property, recycling equipment, cogeneration equipment, and qualified industrial energy efficiency property. Defines \"qualified industrial energy efficiency property\" as property which is part of a modification to an industrial or commercial facility and which: (1) results in decreased energy use per unit of output; (2) results in an aggregate annual decrease in energy consumption by the facility; (3) does not increase the total consumption of oil and natural gas; (4) is constructed or acquired after January 1, 1981; and (5) is depreciable or amortizable property with a useful life of three years or more. Excludes from such definition property for which the energy percentage is otherwise claimed. Extends the period for which such percentage may be applied with respect to such property which is part of projects for which certain construction and financial commitments have been met. Sets forth a formula for determining reductions or increases in the credit based on a ratio between the energy percentage amount and Btu savings. Reduces the credit attributable to application of the energy percentage where the use of qualified industrial energy efficiency property results in an increase of more than ten percent in the capacity of the facility. Provides that the applicable percentage of such property, for purposes of determining qualified investment, shall be 100 percent, without regard to the useful life of the property. Revises the definition of \"alternative energy property\" to: (1) include equipment for converting an alternate substance into electricity, up to the electrical transmission stage; (2) define \"boiler\"; and (3) include heat treating furnaces which use as the primary fuel an alternate substance, melt furnaces which use no fuel or use as the primary fuel an alternate substance, and modification equipment which is used in a facility which uses as the primary fuel an alternate substance and which reduces the use of fuels other than alternate substances. Expands the definition of \"alternate substance\" to include petroleum coke, petroleum pitch, synthetic fuels, and any product derived from an alternate substance. Excepts taxpayers from the primary fuel requirement in specified circumstances. Revises the definition of \"specially defined energy property.\" Revises the definition of \"recycling equipment\" to: (1) include property used for the unloading, transfer, and storage of solid waste; and (2) include property used in the recovery of additional reusable resources and materials. Includes in the definition of \"cogeneration equipment\" property comprising a system for the generation of mechanical shaft power. Excludes as a fuel, for purposes of the definition of \"biomass property,\" certain recyclable waste paper. Excludes from treatment as energy property any specially defined energy or qualified industrial energy efficiency property used as public utility property unless such property is installed in connection with specified types of generating facilities. Provides rules regarding: (1) the replacement of equipment or processes by energy property; and (2) energy property which increases the operating capacity of a process or facility. Treats as qualified industrial energy efficiency property reasonably necessary for the operation of alternative energy property, specially defined energy property, recycling equipment, cogeneration equipment, or qualified industrial energy efficiency property. Title II: Refundable Investment Credit - Provides for the refundability of the investment tax credit."
