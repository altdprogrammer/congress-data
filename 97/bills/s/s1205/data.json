    "text": "Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to the Environmental Protection Agency for specified environmental research, development, and demonstration activities relating to air quality, water quality, water supply, solid and hazardous wastes, pesticides, radiation, interdisciplinary activities, toxic substances, and energy. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1982 to the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development for program management and support. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to utilize funds authorized under this Act for appropriate scientific and professional review of research and development grant, contract, and cooperative agreement applications. Permits transfers of funds of up to ten percent between categories of activities authorized under this Act, as well as transfers of more than ten percent if the Congress is notified and the appropriate committees do not object. Requires that at least 15 percent of funds appropriated for each activity be obligated and expended for long-term environmental research and development programs. Reduces the total amount of appropriations authorized under this Act by $1,000,000 (such reduction to be apportioned among the supported activities at the discretion of the Administrator)."
