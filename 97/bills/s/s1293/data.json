    "text": "Social Welfare Amendments of 1981 - Title I: Amendments to the Program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children - Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act to determine ineligible for aid any family whose resources, other than a home and an automobile, exceed $1,000. Authorizes a State to consider as income food stamps and any rent or housing subsidy (to the extent they duplicate the amount of AFDC allotted for food or housing). Provides that in determining a child's need for AFDC the finances of a stepparent or any other unrelated person living in the home (other than a bona fide tenant) shall be taken into consideration. Revises earned income disregards. Includes as earned income an individual's earned income advance. Excludes any family from receiving AFDC if the family's total income, without disregards, exceeds 150 percent of the State's standard of need. Revises the community work experience program. Requires a State AFDC plan to operate such a program. Requires such a program, among other things, to: (1) not displace currently employed individuals; (2) provide reasonable work conditions; (3) not require unreasonable travel of participants; (4) be limited to a certain number of hours per month; and (5) provide up to $25 monthly for transportation. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Intergovernmental Recipient Information Service to provide for the orderly collection, maintenance, and interchange of information among Federal and State agencies providing benefits to individuals or families under public assistance programs, and to avoid waste, fraud, abuse, and the duplication of administrative efforts by agencies. Prohibits AFDC payments in situations where the caretaker relative is participating in a strike. Limits the term \"dependent child\" with respect to age to full-time secondary school students under age 19 (formerly 21 and included college or vocational school). Permits AFDC payments to a pregnant woman, during the last month of her pregnancy or within the following three-month period, if the child would be eligible for AFDC. Eliminates references to \"mother\" or \"father\" and refers instead to the \"principal wage earner\" or \"parent or other caretaker of a child\" for purposes of determining AFDC eligibility by reason of parental unemployment and the applicability of the work registration requirement. Provides that AFDC eligibility for a month shall be determined on the basis of the family's resources for that month, and that the benefit amount shall be determined on the basis of the income and resources of the first or second preceding month. Requires AFDC families to report their income on a monthly basis. Prohibits AFDC payments below ten dollars (however, an individual entitled to a payment below ten dollars shall be deemed an AFDC recipient but shall be ineligible to participate in a community work experience program). Requires a State to: (1) promptly correct any AFDC overpayment or underpayment; and (2) impose a lien against a recipient's home to recover aid. Requires an individual to be either a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise lawfully permanently residing in the United States in order to be considered a dependent child, a caretaker relative, or an individual whose needs should be considered in determining need. Provides that the income and resources of an alien's sponsor shall be deemed to be the unearned income and resources of such alien for three years after the alien's entry into the United States for purposes of determining AFDC eligibility. Exempts specified classes of aliens from this requirement. Eliminates Federal funding for AFDC State or local personnel training. Title II: Amendments to the Child Support Enforcement Program - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to authorize appropriations for the enforcement of support obligations owed by absent parents not only to their children, as is presently provided for, but also to the spouse, or former spouse, with whom such child is living. Provides that a State providing child support collection services for individuals not otherwise eligible for services shall retain ten percent of the fee collected. Prohibits a child support obligation assigned to a State (as a condition of eligibility for AFDC) from being discharged in bankruptcy. Title III: Amendments to the Supplemental Security Income Program - Amends title XVI of the Social Security Act to revise the level of State supplementary payments. Prohibits funding, from SSI funds, the cost of a State's vocational rehabilitation services provided to blind and disabled SSI recipients. Provides that SSI eligiblity for a month shall be determined on the basis of income and resources for that month, and that the benefit amount shall be determined on the basis of the income and resources of the first or second month preceding such month. Title IV: Effective Date - Sets forth effective dates for the provisions of this Act."
