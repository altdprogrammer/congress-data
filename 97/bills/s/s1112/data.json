    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H. R. 3567 passed in lieu) Export Administration Amendments Act of 1981 - Amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to carry out such Act. Requires departments or agencies with information relevant to enforcement of such Act to furnish the appropriate department or agency with such information. Exempts census information and certain tax return information from such requirement. Increases the maximum criminal fine: (1) for violations of such Act; and (2) for failure to report that goods exported under a validated license are being used by the importing country for military or intelligence gathering purposes contrary to the license conditions. Makes such fines less for individuals than in other cases. Imposes a higher ceiling on the fine for violations involving national security controls or export controls on defense articles and services than for other violations of such Act. Requires all information regarding export controls to be made available upon request to the appropriate congressional committee and to the General Accounting Office (GAO). Prohibits such committee and the GAO from disclosing, except under specified circumstances, any such information that was submitted confidentially. States that national security export controls do not authorize export controls on farm products. Requires the President to report to Congress any prohibition of exports of farm products if such prohibition is imposed to further U.S. foreign policy but is not made in connection with an overall prohibition of exports. Requires an expression of congressional approval of such prohibition through adoption of a joint resolution in order for the prohibition to remain in effect. States that such prohibition shall cease to be effective if such a resolution is not adopted within a specified time. Sets the effective date for the exclusion of farm products from national security export controls and for the requirement of congressional approval of export controls on farm products. Requires the administration to continue to implement policies necessary to sustain the decrease in interest rates. Directs the President to encourage financial institutions to exercise restraint in extending credit for unproductive large scale corporate takeovers. States that this Act can be used as authority for a total embargo if the Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact countries take military action against Poland. Expresses the sense of the Senate that a suspension or restriction of all U.S. exports to the Soviet Union shall be imposed if the Soviet Union or its allies engage in direct military action against Poland."
