Requires any registered broker or dealer in securities (other than exempted securities or commercial paper, bankers' acceptances or commercial bills) to join a registered securities association, unless such broker or dealer effects securities transactions solely on a national securities exchange of which it is a member. Permits the Commission to exempt any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers from such requirement. Amends Federal law to permit participants in the professional fellows programs of the Securities and Exchange Commission to accept the payment of relocation expenses."
