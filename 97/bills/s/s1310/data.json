    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1981-06-03", 
    "text": "Urban Jobs and Enterprise Zone Act of 1981 - Title I: Designation of Enterprise Zones - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the designation of enterprise zones, for a period ending December 31, 2001, and subject to the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, by local governments or by State governments on behalf of local governments for purposes of extending the tax incentives and regulatory flexibility measures provided by titles II and III of this Act. Specifies that the Secretary may approve the designation of such zones only if: (1) the area is within the jurisdiction of the designating local government; (2) the boundary of the area is continuous and includes accessible vacant or underutilized properties; (3) the area has a population of at least 4,000 if any portion thereof is located within a standard metropolitan statistical area with a population of at least 50,000 or 2,500 otherwise, or is an Indian reservation; and (4) the area meets specified unemployment and poverty requirements. Requires designating local governments, as a condition of the Secretary's approval, to agree in writing to follow a course of action which may include reducing tax rates, improving local services, simplifying or streamlining regulation of business, or receiving commitments of private entities to assist employees and residents of the area. Terminates the authority of the Secretary to designate enterprise zones on December 31, 1996. Sets forth minimum and maximum numbers of such designations. Describes areas to which preference shall be given in deciding to designate enterprise zones. Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to set forth the duties of the Secretary under this Act. Requires any property tax reduction effected by a local government under an agreed to program to be disregarded for purposes of determining the eligibility of a State or local government for Federal assistance or benefits. Expresses the sense of the Congress that whenever possible, foreign-trade zones should be established within enterprise zones and that in the case of any application for designation of a foreign-trade zone within an enterprise zone: (1) the Foreign-Trade Zone Board should expedite the application process; (2) the Board, in evaluating such application, should consider future development to be expected as a result of the incentives provided by this Act; and (3) the Board should provide technical assistance to the applicants. Title II: Taxation - Subtitle A: Refundable Credits for Employers and Employees - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a refundable income tax credit for five percent of the wages paid to unemployed or economically disadvantaged individuals who are certified as eligible under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act and who perform at least 50 percent of their services within an enterprise zone. Disallows a deduction for the portion of the wages or salaries equal to the amount of such credit. Allows individuals who are employees of qualified businesses and at least 50 percent of whose services during the taxable year are performed in an enterprise zone a refundable tax credit for five percent of the earned income attributable to services performed in an enterprise zone during a 36-month period. Limits such credit to $1,500 for any taxable year. Defines \"qualified business\" as a person: (1) at least 50 percent of whose gross receipts are attributable to the active conduct of a trade or business within an enterprise zone; and (2) at least 40 percent of whose employees are individuals whose employment qualifies for the employers' credit allowed under this subtitle and who are hired after the later of the dates on which the conduct of a business in an enterprise zone is begun or the area is designated as such a zone. Subtitle B: Reduction in Capital Gain Tax Rates - Reduces the alternative tax on capital gains and increases the capital gains deduction. Qualifies certain low-income rental housing located in an enterprise zone for such treatment. Permits property to remain qualified for purposes of the revised capital gains treatment after a designation of an enterprise zone has terminated. Exempts gain from the sale or exchange of property used in a business in an enterprise zone from the computation of the minimum tax. Removes as an item of tax preference accelerated depreciation on real property used in such a business. Subtitle C: Reduction in Gross Income of Trades or Businesses Operating in Zone - Excludes from taxable income a specified percentage of the sum of any amount received by a qualified business from the active conduct of a trade or business within an enterprise zone and any interest on financing provided by a taxpayer to a qualified business in connection with the conduct of such business. Subtitle D: Other Incentives - Permits any qualified business to elect to use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting without regard to any inventory requirements if its gross receipts do not exceed $2,000,000 in any prior taxable year. Allows a 20-year carryover of net operating losses for qualified businesses. Qualifies for the investment tax credit low-income rental housing with respect to which the capital gains tax reduction is granted under subtitle B of this title. Subtitle E: Sense of the Congress with Respect to Tax Simplification - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Internal Revenue Service should simplify the administration and enforcement of any provision of the Internal Revenue code affected by this title. Title III: Regulatory Flexibility - Revises the definition of \"small entity\" for purposes of the analysis of regulatory functions, to include qualified businesses (as defined in Title II of this Act), designating governments, and nonprofit enterprises operating within enterprise zones."
