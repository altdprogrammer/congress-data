    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 6267 passed in lieu) Depository Institutions Amendments of 1982 - Title I: Deposit Insurance Flexibility - Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act - Part A: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Amendments - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to make loans to, make deposits in, purchase the assets or securities of, assume the liabilities of, or make contributions to, any insured bank if such action is taken: (1) to prevent the bank's closing; (2) to restore a closed insured bank; or (3) to lessen the risk to the Corporation posed by an insured bank under the threat of instability due to severe financial conditions. Authorizes the FDIC, in order to facilitate a merger or consolidation of an insured bank or the sale of assets of such insured bank and the assumption of its liabilities, or the acquisition of its stock, to: (1) purchase any such assets or assume such liabilities; (2) make loans or contributions to, or deposits in, or purchase the securities of, such institution; (3) guarantee it or the company which controls or will acquire control of it against loss by reason of merging or consolidating; or (4) any combination of the above. Prohibits the FDIC from using such authority to purchase the voting or common stock of an insured bank. Requires the Corporation, in its annual report to Congress, to report the total amount it has saved by exercising the authority provided in this Act. Amends the Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 to permit the Home Loan Bank Board to authorize the conversion of a State-chartered savings bank insured by the FDIC into a Federal savings bank. Requires continued FDIC insurance coverage for a converted bank. Permits such a conversion only where: (1) the board of trustees of the bank has specified in writing that the bank is in danger of closing or is closed, or that severe financial conditions exist that threaten the bank's stability and a conversion is likely to improve its financial conditions; and (2) the board of trustees has requested in writing that the FDIC use such authority. Amends the National Housing Act to grant the Federal Home Loan Bank Board the same supervisory powers with regard to a FDIC insured federal savings bank that it has with other Federal associations. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to allow a closed insured bank with assets of a specified amount, or insured banks with specified assets which are in danger of closing, to be acquired by out of State banks or holding companies. Permits the FDIC, in the case of a closed bank, to sell the assets of such bank and arrange for the assumption of its liabilities by an insured depository institution located in the same State. Permits the FDIC, in the case of an insured bank with a certain amount of assets which is in danger of closing, to arrange an acquisition by an insured depository institution located in the State where the insured bank is chartered. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to permit a waiver of notice and hearing requirements to allow the Federal Reserve to approve emergency acquisitions of thrift institutions by commercial banks. Part B - Federal Home Loan Bank Board Amendments - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to allow the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to authorize a mutual institution to become, or merge into, a newly-chartered, Federal stock savings bank. Amends the National Housing Act to permit the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to provide assistance to insured institutions when severe financial conditions exist which threaten the stability of a significant number of insured institutions. Includes deposits in the institution or the purchase of securities as a type of assistance. Prohibits FSLIC purchase of the voting or common stock of an insured bank. Permits the Corporation to authorize an insured institution eligible for assistance to merge with any other insured institution or an FDIC insured bank or to be acquired by any holding company. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to waive the requirement when severe financial conditions exist that a portion of net earnings of the banks be set aside semiannually to a reserve account, and to allow the banks to pay dividends from undivided profits. Amends the National Housing Act to permit the FSLIC to borrow from the Federal Home Loan banks. Requires the rate on such a loan to be at least the bank's marginal cost of funds, with adequate security. Permits the FSLIC, if extraordinary financial conditions exist, to terminate distribution of shares of the secondary reserve and utilize said reserve on the same basis as the primary reserve. Part C - Credit Unions - Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to permit the National Credit Union Administration Board to authorize: (1) a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union which is insolvent, or is in danger of insolvency, with any other insured credit union; or (2) a purchase and assumption by an insured credit union of all or any part of the assets and liabilities of any other insured credit union which is in such danger. Permits the Board, ex parte without notice, to appoint itself as conservator and immediately take possession and control of the business and assets of any insured credit union where: (1) such action is necessary to conserve the assets of such a credit union; (2) the credit union consents to such an action; and (3) in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the State credit union supervisor is consulted at least 24 hours before the use of this authority by the Board. Part D - Sunset Provisions - Terminates the emergency provisions contained in Title I of this Act three years after the date of enactment. Title II: Capital Assistance - Capital Assistance Act of 1982 - Amends the National Housing Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to authorize the FSLIC and the FDIC to increase or maintain the capital of a qualified institution by making periodic purchases of capital instruments from such institution. Declares that each Insurance Corporation, with respect to the instruments held by it, shall a priority over any claim arising out of an equity interest in an insured bank in the event of a liquidation or reorganization and over any right of equity holders to participate in future earnings. Requires such a bank to have: (1) a net worth of at most three percent of its assets; (2) losses for two consecutive quarters; (3) a prospect of solvency for more than six months; and (4) investments in residential mortgages or mortgage backed securities equal to at least 20 percent of its assets. Sets forth the initial capital instruments that the FSLIC and FDIC may purchase. Allows the FSLIC and the FDIC to establish criteria which with respect to ranges of net worth, calculation of losses, and percentage of losses to be met by purchases of capital instruments, differ from such criteria set forth by this Act. Prohibits both the FSLIC and the FDIC from using their authority to purchase the voting or common stock of a qualified institution. Prohibits any such assistance from being provided to a qualified institution if the FSLIC or the FDIC determines that providing such assistance would be costlier than liquidating such institution. Terminates the provisions of this title three years after the enactment of this act. Title III: Thrift Institutions Restructuring - Thrift Institutions Restructuring Act of 1982 - Part A - Form of Charter; Demand Accounts - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to authorize the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to charter Federal stock banks as well as savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks for investment and credit purposes in addition to the provision of home financing. Permits a Federal savings and loan association to raise capital in the form of demand accounts. Specifies that all savings accounts and demand accounts will have priority upon liquidation. Reduces from 30 days to 14 days the statutory notice-of-withdrawal period for savings accounts. Repeals the prohibition against the issuance of capital stock by Federal savings and loans. Grants any association the authority to issue such capital stock. Permits any institution that is a Federal Home Loan Bank member (or is eligible to become a member) to convert to a Federal savings and loan association, a Federal savings bank, or a Federal mutual savings bank (and from the mutual form to the stock form, or vice versa). Revises the procedures and requirements for conversion of any Federal association back to a State type institution. Allows any aggrieved person to obtain review of a final action of the Board or the FSLIC which approves or disapproves a plan of conversion from the mutual to the stock form. Permits any Federal savings bank chartered before the enactment of this Act or any Federal savings bank formerly organized as a mutual savings bank to continue to make any investment or engage in any activity not otherwise authorized by this Act to the degree it was authorized to do so. Amends the National Housing Act to retain FSLIC jurisdiction over State mutual to State stock conversion involving insured institutions. Eliminates specified reporting requirements concerning such conversion activity. Repeals the prohibition against the creation of Federal stock institutions in States where stock associations do not exist. Part B - Investments - Amends the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933 to expand investment authority of associations with respect to: (1) overdrafts; (2) real property loans; (3) time deposits; (4) State securities; (5) consumer loans; (6) personal property; (7) education loans; (8) housing and land development loans; (9) foreign assistance investments; (10) small business investment companies; (11) commercial loans. Provides for the phase-out before January 1, 1984 of interest rate differentials for any category of deposits or accounts between any bank and any savings and loan. Requires the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee to authorize not later than 60 days from enactment of this Act a new account that will enable depository institutions to compete with money market mutual funds. Declares that no limitation on the maximun rate or rates of interest payable on deposit accounts shall apply to such accounts. Prohibits any association from conditioning an extension of credit on the purchase of a product from the association. Prohibits any association from establishing, retaining, or operating a branch outside the State in which the association has its home office, unless the association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association. Prohibits any savings and loan holding company whose subsidiary insured institution fails to qualify as a domestic building and loan association from commencing, or continuing for more than three years after such failure, any business activity other than those specified for multiple savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries. Part C - Preemption of Due-on-Sale Prohibitions - Permits a lender to enter into or enforce a contract containing a due-on-sale clause with respect to a real property loan. Postpones until three years after enactment of this Act authorization to enforce due-on-sale clause in the case of any contract involving a real property loan made or assumed during a period when a State had prohibited due-on-sale clauses. Permits a State legislature to enact laws within such three-year period with respect to loans originated in non-Federal institutions. Permits the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Credit Union Administration to regulate similar loans originated by national banks or federal credit unions. Sets forth circumstances under which a lender may not exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause. Delcares that such rules and regulations may permit a lender to exercise its option under a due-on-sale clause with respect to a real property loan and any related agreement under which a borrower obtains the right to receive future income. Part D - Miscellaneous - Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 to allow the courts to assess attorneys' fees against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board only when the agency loses the case. Grants authority to compensate members of the Federal Savings and Loan Advisory Council.

Repeals the authority of a national banking association to act as broker for real estate loans in places with a population of 5,000 or less. Allows the Comptroller to issue a certificate of authority to commence the business of banking to a national banking association which is organized solely to do business with other financial institutions if such association is owned exclusively by other depository institutions and is engaged exclusively in providing banking services for other banks. Permits an association to purchase for its own account shares of stock of a national banking association which is organized solely to do business with other financial institutions. Permits actions and proceedings against any national bank for which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been appointed as receiver to be brought in any district or territorial court of the United States within the district in which such bank is located, or in any State, county, or municipal court having jurisdiction in similar cases, in the county or city in which such bank is located. Authorizes a national bank to open or close, at its discretion, on a legal holiday declared by a State or District of Columbia official, unless the Comptroller directs otherwise. Amends the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 to provide the authority to terminate the closed receivership fund for national banks which have been closed and for which the Comptroller has appointed a receiver other than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Adds to such Act a Part C - Disposition of Unclaimed Property Recovered from Closed National Banks. Sets forth the procedures for disposition of unclaimed property in the possession, custody, or control of the Comptroller which was recovered from closed national banks. Authorizes the Comptroller to issue rules and regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out such disposition.

Exempts financial institutions with less than a specified amount of total deposits from the reserve requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980.

Requires the prior approval of the board of directors of a bank in the case of loans to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders or their related interest aggregating more than a specified amount. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exclude any foreign bank having an insured branch in the United States from provisions of such Act relating to loans, extensions of credit, and other dealings between member banks and their affiliates. Applies such provisions to the insured bank itself. Amends the Federal Reserve Act, the Home Owners' Loan Act, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 to permit the agency having authority to impose a civil monetary penalty under such Act to compromise, modify, or remit, in its discretion, any civil monetary penalty which is subject to imposition or has been imposed under such authority.
