    "text": "Air Carrier Employees Protection Act of 1982 - Amends the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 with respect to the employee protection program by eliminating provisions which make payments under such program subject to amounts provided in appropriation Acts. Requires that monthly assistance payments be equal to the average of such amounts provided in the previous year. Requires the Secretary of Labor when making such payments to deduct the full amounts of benefits received by the protected employee under Federal or State law relating to unemployment compensation, food stamps, public assistance, or welfare programs. Grants protected employees who were furloughed or terminated by air carriers certified under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 prior to enactment of this Act the first right of hire on a regional basis by any other such air carrier. Provides that flight deck operating crew members shall not retain rights of seniority or recall with the air carrier from which they were furloughed or terminated. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to periodically publish the comprehensive list of available jobs with certified air carriers on a regional basis. Requires the Secretary of Labor to certify that employee protection agreements meet certain standards. Grants the United States district courts jurisdiction of actions to enforce duties under such agreements."
