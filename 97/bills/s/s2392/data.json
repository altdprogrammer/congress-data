    "text": "Food Stamp Amendments of 1982 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to revise the value of a household allotment to equal the cost of the thrifty food plan reduced by 35 percent (currently 30 percent) of the household's income. Allows the consideration of such allotments as income for purposes of laws relating to the provision of housing assistance. Declares that energy assistance payments shall be included as household income. Eliminates the earned income deduction in computing household income. Provides for downward rounding in adjustments of the thrifty food plan, the computation of deductions in household income, and calculations in determining the value of allotments. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to require reporting and inquiry information relative to employment from food stamp applicants at the time of their application. Directs the Secretary to institute an error liability program under which a State agency will be liable to the Secretary for certain amounts of erroneous excess payments. Authorizes the Secretary to establish reporting requirements for State agencies to determine the appropriate level of funding for State agency administrative costs. Sets forth the amount of funding the Secretary may make available for such costs. Authorizes the disclosure of information obtained from eligible households to administrators of Federal assistance programs and federally assisted State programs. Authorizes appropriations for the Puerto Rico block grants for fiscal years 1983 through 1985. Authorizes appropriations for the food stamp program for FY 1983."
