    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 97-158) Headstart Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) continue the administrative arrangement responsible for meeting the needs of migrant and Indian children; and (2) assure that appropriate funding is provided to meet such needs. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to eligible agencies for the planning, conduct, administration, and evaluation of a Headstart program focused primarily on children from low-income families who have not reached compulsory school attendance age. Requires that such program provide: (1) comprehensive health, nutritional, educational, social, and other services to aid children to attain their full potential; and (2) for direct participation of parents in the overall program at the local level. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary to reserve 15 percent of such appropriations for each fiscal year for: (1) Indian and migrant Headstart programs (with such payments revised for cost-of-living adjustments reflecting changes in the Consumer Price Index); (2) services for handicapped children; (3) payments to Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands according to their respective needs, but not exceeding 2 percent of the appropriation for any fiscal year; (4) training and technical assistance activities sufficient for program expansion and improvement; and (5) discretionary payments by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to allot the remaining 85 percent of such appropriations for each fiscal year among the States, so that: (1) each State receives an amount equal to the amount received for fiscal year 1981; and (2) (a) one-third of any remaining amount is distributed on the basis of relative numbers of children from birth through age 18 on whose behalf Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) payments are made and (b) two-thirds of such amount is distributed on the basis of relative numbers of children from birth through age five living with families within incomes below the poverty line. Provides for ratable reductions in all State allotments in case of insufficient appropriations. Limits financial assistance for a Headstart program under this Act to 80 percent of the approved costs, with such exceptions as the Secretary may determine. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring non-Federal contributions greater than 20 percent of such costs. Requires that approved programs provide services in addition to, and not in substitution for, comparable services previously provided without Federal assistance. Directs the Secretary to establish policies and procedures to assure that for fiscal year 1976 and thereafter at least ten percent of total enrollment opportunities in Headstart programs in each State shall be available for handicapped children and that services to meet their special needs shall be provided. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the status of handicapped children in the Headstart programs. Directs the Secretary to assure equitable distribution of the benefits of this Act to rural and urban residents. Authorizes the Secretary to designate as a Headstart agency any local public or private nonprofit agency which: (1) has power and authority to carry out certain functions within a community; and (2) can plan, conduct, administer, and evaluate a Headstart program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) give priority to agencies already receiving Headstart program funds or operating Headstart programs; and (2) continue to involve parents and area residents in selection of such agencies. Sets forth the powers and functions of Headstart agencies. Requires that plans setting forth a proposed contract, agreement, grant, or other assistance for a Headstart program be submitted to the appropriate State Governor. Requires that the Secretary reconsider any plan disapproved by a Governor. Permits assistance for such plan if it is found to be fully consistent with the purposes of this Act. Exempts assistance to institutions of higher education from such review by a Governor. Sets forth administrative requirements and standards for each Headstart agency. Directs the Secretary to prescribe eligibility criteria for participation in Headstart programs, including children from families below the poverty line and others who would benefit. Requires, whenever a program is operated in a community with less than 1,000 population and certain conditions exist, that such program establish eligibility criteria. Prohibits the Secretary from charging any fees for participation in Headstart programs. Directs the Secretary to prescribe procedures for appeals, notice, and hearings relating to denials or delays of delegate agency status or to suspensions or terminations of financial assistance. Sets forth provisions for record keeping by, and audits of, Headstart agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and training for Headstart programs. Authorizes the Secretary to assist research, demonstration, and pilot projects to further the purposes of this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish an overall plan to govern the approval and use of such projects; (2) make a public announcement concerning contracts for, and results of, such projects; (3) assure that all project studies, proposals, and data become U.S. property; and (4) publish summaries of results and submit these to the appropriate Congressional committees. Sets forth provisions for the evaluation of Headstart programs, with the assistance of university faculty in the appropriate State. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish the results and summaries of evaluative research and to submit these to the appropriate Congressional committees; and (2) assure that products of such evaluation become U.S. property. Provides for annual revision of the poverty line used as a criterion of eligibility for Headstart program participation. Sets forth provisions for comparability of wages for those employed in Headstart programs with those paid for substantially comparable services. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions, including nondiscrimination provisions relating to the handicapped. Prohibits employees of agencies assisted under this Act, pursuant to or during performance of services so assisted, from aiding in the conduct of any unlawful demonstration, rioting, or civil disturbance. Sets forth prohibitions against specified political activities involving Headstart programs. Sets forth provisions for advance funding of programs under this Act. Repeals title V of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (Head Start and Follow Through programs and day care projects). Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1982 through 1984 for grants to States for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs."
