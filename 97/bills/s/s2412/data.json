    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1982-04-21", 
    "text": "Bilingual Education Improvements Act of 1982 - Amends the Bilingual Education Act to redefine \"program of bilingual education\" to mean a special program of instruction for elementary and secondary school children of limited English proficiency in which instruction for the acquisition of English language skills, given with appreciation of the cultural heritage of such children, is designed to: (1) meet the educational needs of such children; and (2) provide such children equal opportunity in all required courses or subjects of study. Provides that nothing in such definition or in such Act shall be construed to require a recipient of funds to use any particular method or approach for providing education to children of limited English proficiency. Requires that bilingual education program assistance applications be accompanied by evidence that the applicant has selected methods of instruction designed to meet the special needs and characteristics of the children in the target population to be served. Revises personnel requirements for Federal aid to bilingual education programs to include only those teachers who are proficient in English and, to the extent possible, in any other language used to provide instruction. Requires that persons other than teachers involved in instruction in such bilingual education projects and activities be, to the extent possible, proficient in English and any other language used to provide instruction. Directs the Commissioner of Education to give priority to bilingual education assistance applications from local educational agencies which propose to assist children of limited English proficiency whose usual language is not English (in addition to current criteria for such priority). Directs the Commissioner, through grants to and contracts with eligible applicants, to provide for the establishment, operation, or improvement of vocational training programs designed to: (1) enable persons with limited English proficiency to participate in job training programs; (2) train instructors and counselors for job training programs which assist such persons; or (3) assist eligible applicants to develop and disseminate instructional materials and methods that meet the job training needs of such persons. Includes studies to determinate alternative methods of providing educational services to children of limited English proficiency among those research activities authorized to be assisted under such Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Act for FY 1983 through FY 1985."
