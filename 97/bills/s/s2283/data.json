Authorizes the President to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements to achieve such openness. Authorizes the President, in order to carry out an agreement concluded under this Act, to: (1) proclaim the necessary modification or continuance of any existing duty free or excise treatment, or the necessary additional duties; and (2) use the procedures contained in the sections of the Trade Act of 1974 dealing with nontariff trade barriers if changes in U.S. law are needed. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a method to monitor high technology trade and investment in foreign markets, to evaluate the openness of trade and investment opportunities in these markets, and to further the objectives of this Act. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President and to Congress on the results of the monitoring."
