    "text": "Authorizes appropriations for FY 1982 and 1983 for the Patent and Trademark Office. Increases the percentage of processing and maintenance costs to be recovered by patent fees. Permits the Commissioner of Patents to accept the payment of maintenance fees after the six-month grace period if the delay is unavoidable. Protects the use or manufacture by others of anything covered by such a patent during the period between the grace period and the actual payment of the fee. Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 to require the Commissioner of Patents to recover through fees all rather than half of the costs of registering a trademark. Requires the exclusive use of such fees for processing registrations and other services related to trademarks. Eliminates the ceiling on the number of examiners-in-chief in the Office. Revises the patent application procedures. Permits the Commissioner to certify a correction of inventor in an issued patent even though such error did not involve joint inventors. Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 to permit the Commissioner, upon petition rather than unilaterally, to declare that an interference exists between two trademarks."
