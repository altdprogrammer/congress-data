    "text": "Sailing School Vessels Act of 1982 - Sets forth provisions to include sailing school vessels operated by nonprofit educational institutions under the regulatory authority of the Coast Guard as small passenger-carrying vessels. Excludes sailing school instructors or students from the definition of \"passenger\" for such vessels. Declares that such instructors or students shall not be considered seamen under Federal statutes. Requires each owner or charterer of a sailing school vessel to maintain evidence of financial responsibility to meet liability for death or injury to sailing school students or instructors on vessel voyages. Declares that such vessels shall not be deemed merchant vessels nor vessels engaged in trade or commerce. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to prescribe rules and regulations necessary to carry out this Act."
