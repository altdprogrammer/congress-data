Permits the lessee to use the land to, among other things: (1) dispose of oil shale waste; and (2) build plants, reduction works, and other needed facilities. Requires a lease to contain provisions providing for proper protection of environmental and other resource values. Sets forth guidelines for determining the duration of the lease and the rental fee."
