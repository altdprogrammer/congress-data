    "text": "Ports Development and Assistance Act of 1981 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to study and prepare a feasibility report on the enlargement of the navigation improvements at each deep-draft harbor serving international shipping in the United States. Requires each port through the appropriate non-Federal port authority to submit an application to the Secretary for eligibility to participate in the reimbursement plan established by this Act. Sets forth the procedure for the review and approval of such applications by specified Senate and House committees within 90 days after submission, or, if not acted upon by the committees, by the Secretary of the Army. Makes the following ports eligible for such reimbursement: (1) Galveston Harbor, Texas; (2) Corpus Christi Harbor, Texas; (3) Brazos Island Harbor, Texas; (4) Norfolk Harbor and Channels, Virginia; (5) Brunswick Island Harbor, Georgia; and (6) Houston Ship Channel, Texas. Directs the Chief of Engineers, upon the enactment of a project authorization for port or channel improvements, to reimburse the local interests (non-Federal port authority), in accordance with this Act, for 75 percent of the funds expended by such interests to construct such portions of the project as are included in the approval project. Makes the authorization to reimburse local interests contained in this Act subject to appropriation, and shall expire three years from the issuance of appropriate Federal permits, unless local interests begin construction of any portion of the project within such three-year period."
