Directs OMB to require agencies to report, on a quarterly basis and for subsequent transmital to Congress, the data OMB needs to determine such statistics and compile such information, including: (1) the initial and current cost estimates of a project, with an explanation of any cost growth of 25 percent or more and a description of actions taken to control cost growth; (2) the originally estimated completion date and the actual or currently estimated date, with an explanation for any difference exceeding six months; and (3) any changes in the size or quantity of a project, with an explanation for the changes. Directs OMB to: (1) notify Congress whenever it determines that the cost of a project has increased or will increase by 25 percent or more (discounting inflation); and (2) provide Congress with certain information about project costs. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of additional funds for the project after such notification unless Congress enacts a joint resolution authorizing continued obligations and expenditures for one year."
