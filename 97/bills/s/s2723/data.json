Directs the Secretary of Defense to determine which of those occupations is necessary to the improved efficiency of defense procurement. Directs the Secretary of Labor, upon application, to designate a State a participating State if it: (1) has high concentrations of experienced workers dislocated by major changes in its economic base; (2) will establish a system for selecting, training, and relocating displaced workers; and (3) evidences understanding of defense procurement procedures and establishes relationships with contractors to assist in the placement of experienced displaced workers. Directs the Secretary of Defense to set aside up to one percent of funds available for weapons systems for FY 1983-1987 for the special training program. Directs the Secretary to select appropriate contractors to participate in this program, requiring at least ten percent of the workers to be displaced workers hired and trained under the program. Requires the Secretary to reimburse such contractors for the costs of training these workers. Authorizes appropriations."
