Requires that investments made by the Board secure the maximum possible interest yield commensurate with the safety of the Trust Funds. Fixes the interest rates for public-debt obligations issued for purchase by the Trust Funds at the average market yield on all marketable interest bearing U.S. obligations forming part of the public debt, all marketable interest bearing obligations which are not U.S. obligations but which are guaranteed by the United States, and all marketable federally sponsored agency interest bearing obligations which are lawful investments for fiduciary and trust funds under Federal control. Authorizes the Managing Trustee to use the equipment and experts necessary to assure the maximum possible interest yield on Trust Fund investments."
