Amends the Federal criminal code to extend the scope of the current provision authorizing a physical zone of protection for the President to all Secret Service protectees. Establishes a new offense of threatening to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon a former President, major presidential or vice-presidential candidate or spouse of a candidate, or member of the immediate family of the President or Vice President. Limits the Secret Service protection of the spouse and minor children of a former President to a period of six months. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to extend such protection if necessary. Extends the authority of the Secret Service to investigate fraud against the Government and offenses involving the electronic transfer of data for U.S. or foreign government funds. Authorizes the reimbursement of Secret Service agents for subsistence expenses while on protective missions on a 24-hour basis in a nontravel status. Establishes a new offense of forging endorsements on Treasury checks or United States bonds or securities."
