Authorizes the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee to review provisions of State statutes, upon request by the State, to determine if such statutes are generally applicable to provisions of this title. Directs the Committee, upon a favorable determination, to recommend to the Secretary to make an incentive grant to such State. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 from the Highway Trust Fund for purposes of this title. Title II: National Driver Register - National Driver Register Act of 1982 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish and maintain a National Driver Register to assist chief driver licensing officials of participating States in exchanging information regarding the motor vehicle driving records of individuals. Requires the Secretary to promulgate a final rule which provides for orderly transition from the System regarding motor vehicle driving records in the Department of Commerce to the Register established under this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from maintaining information in such Register after: (1) more than a seven-year period from the date of its entry; (2) the State of record removes it from the State's file; or (3) the date of establishment of a fully electronic Register system. Allows any State to participate in such Register system. Directs the chief driver licensing official of a participating State to transmit to the Secretary specified information on certain drivers. Allows access to such information to specified individuals, including the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration and the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Limits the use of such information to official investigations and other specified purposes. Restricts employer access to such information to three years from its date of entry. Directs the Secretary to implement a pilot test program to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a system for electronic referral and relay of information regarding the motor vehicle driving records of individuals. Describes State participation in such program. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the program. Sets forth criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of information from the National Driver Register. Establishes a National Driver Register Subcommittee of the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary directly on the efficiency of the maintenance and operation of the National Driver Register. Directs the Secretary to consult the Subcommittee before prescribing regulations necessary to carry out this Act. Terminates the Subcommittee one year after the end of pilot test program. Directs the Secretary, within four years of the date of enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the level of State participation in and the effectiveness of the Register system. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the provisions of this Act for fiscal year 1983 through 1985."
