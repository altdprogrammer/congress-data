    "text": "George Washington Commemorative Coin Act - Amends the Coinage Act of 1965 to provide for the minting of ten-dollar coins with a design emblematic of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of George Washington. Specifies the size and weight of such coins. Specifies certain inscriptions to be placed on such coins. Provides that such coins shall be sold to the public at a price equal to the cost of minting and distribution plus a surcharge of not more than 20 percent. Directs the President to transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury a specified amount of silver now held in the national stockpile which is in excess of strategic needs. Requires that no such disposal of silver shall be made except for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
