    "text": "Title I: Margin Requirements - Margin Requirements Fairness Act of 1981 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit certain credit transactions for the acquisition of securities of U.S. corporations by either U.S. or non-U.S. persons where such a transaction is financed by either U.S. or non-U.S. lenders if: (1) such a transaction is or would be prohibited if it had been made or had otherwise occurred in a lender's office or other place of business in the United States; and (2) a statement is required to be filed under such Act in connection with the acquisition or carrying of such securities. Requires the statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to such Act, by any person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any equity security of a class which is registered pursuant to such Act, to include information as to whether the margin requirements imposed pursuant to such Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are applicable and not being violated. Applies the provisions of this Act to any purchase or carrying of securities on or after June 24, 1981, if: (1) the loan or extension of credit involved originated, or if the loan proceeds used to purchase or carry such securities were disbursed, on or after such date; or (2) the person who has obtained, received, or used the loan or extension of credit to purchase or carry securities acquires directly or indirectly by any means any additional securities of the same issuer on or after such date. Title II: Foreign Energy Investment - Foreign Energy Investment Act of 1981 - Makes it unlawful, during the period beginning on July 1, 1981, and ending on March 31, 1982, for any Canadian person to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or trade any voting securities of a United States energy resources corporation if, after such acquisition, more than five percent of any class of voting securities of such corporation will be directly or indirectly owned by: (1) such Canadian person; (2) any partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other group of which such Canadian person is a member; (3) the other members of any such partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other group; or (4) any combination of the foregoing. States that such prohibition shall not apply to any acquisition which was the subject of an agreement to merge between a United States energy resources corporation and a Canadian person prior to June 24, 1981. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with specified Federal officials and agencies, to undertake a comprehensive study of direct and indirect investment in United States energy resources enterprises by foreign persons and to report the findings and recommendations to Congress not later than March 1, 1982."
