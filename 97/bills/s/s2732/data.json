Directs the Secretary to begin an inquiry within five days of receiving information that foreign sales to the United States are being seriously offered which involve foreign official export credits that violate international agreements. Requires the inquiry to be completed within 30 days. Directs the Secretary, upon finding such information accurate, to request the withdrawal of such foreign official financing. Authorizes the Secretary to have the Export - Import Bank provide competitive U.S. sellers with matching financing if: (1) such foreign official financing is not withdrawn within ten days of the request; and (2) the Secretary determines that the availability of such foreign official financing is likely to be one of the relevant factors in the sale or sales. (Current law authorizes the Secretary to offer such financing if the financing is likely to be a determining factor in the sale.)"
