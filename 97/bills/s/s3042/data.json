Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to repeal provisions setting forth a formula for the adjustment of Members' pay. Eliminates authority for permanent appropriations for compensation for Members. Requires that the annual pay rate for congressional employees be computed without regard to the annual rate for Members."
