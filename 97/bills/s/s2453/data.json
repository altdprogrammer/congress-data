    "text": "Title I: Amendments to Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 - Revises the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to provide aid for rural housing through the Farmers Home Administration. Eliminates the Secretary's authority to provide grants or direct financial assistance other than loans or loan insurance under rural housing programs. Eliminates provisions limiting the interest rate on and certain amounts of rural housing loans. Requires rural housing loans to bear the rate of interest prevailing in the private market for similar loans. Repeals provisions which: (1) authorize loans for housing and buildings on potentially adequate farms on the same terms as loans may be authorized to adequate farms; (2) authorize the Secretary to cancel interest due on a loan in cases of extreme hardship; (3) authorize the Secretary to issue obligations for the purpose of making direct loans for farm housing; (4) authorize FY 1982 appropriations and terminate the Secretary's loan authority for the mutual and self-help housing program; (5) prohibit rent increases in certain rural housing projects in which tenant's are paying in excess of 25 percent of their incomes for rent; and (6) govern the application of rural housing programs for mobile homes. Authorizes rural housing loans for manufactured housing which: (1) meets standards under the Housing and Community Development Act; (2) is financed with a loan on terms which would apply under the National Housing Act; and (3) meets the Secretary's prescribed terms in case of manufactured housing not treated as real estate under State law. Provides that activities for repairs or improvements of rural dwellings may be financed with rural housing loans if the activities bring the property into compliance with applicable local codes. Requires property standards for new construction of rural housing to be the same as the Minimum Property Standards prescribed by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary: (1) to establish, from amounts made available to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund, a reserve against loan losses sustained by the Fund; and (2) to report to Congress annually concerning the Fund. Authorizes the Secretary to make and insure loans for condominium housing in rural areas. (Currently the Secretary is authorized, in his or her discretion, to make and insure such loans.) Limits the aggregate amount of rural housing loans the Secretary may insure or guarantee for all programs and for specific programs. Authorizes appropriations as may be necessary to meet payments on notes or other obligations issued for farm housing loans equal to: (1) the aggregate of contributions made in the form of credits on principal due on loans made pursuant to loans for housing and buildings on potentially adequate farms; and (2) the interest due on a similar sum represented by notes or other obligations issued by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations as may be required to administer provisions of the National Housing Act and the United States Housing Act of 1937 relating to lower income housing assistance. Extends for one year the Secretary's authority to insure loans for rural housing for the elderly or handicapped. Title II: Rural Housing Block Grants - Rural Housing Block Grant Act of 1982 - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make block grants to States to promote the provision of safe and sanitary housing for residents of rural areas, particularly for those low-income residents of areas having populations of 2,500 or less. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1983, 1984, and 1985. Requires each State to prepare a statement of housing objectives and projected use of funds prior to receipt of a grant. Requires the statement to take into account the needs and conditions of existing housing for low-income Indians living on trust lands. Permits a grant to a State only if the State certifies that: (1) it has permitted the required public examination and appraisal of its statement; (2) the projected use of funds will improve housing condition for the maximum feasible number of low-income families; and (3) the grant will be administered in conformity with applicable laws and this Act (the Rural Housing Block Grant Act of 1982). Requires each State to submit to the Secretary a performance report concerning the use of the funds. Requires the Secretary, at least annually, to review and audit a State's activities. Permits the General Accounting Office to audit the financial transactions of recipients of funds under this Act to the extent that the transactions relate to such funds. Provides that activities assisted under this Act may include: (1) rehabilitation of existing homes for occupancy by low-income residents; (2) the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing buildings for low-income housing by both public and private entities; (3) financing the construction and purchase of modest homes for low-income persons; (4) provision of multifamily housing where there is a demonstrated need for low-income rental housing or farmworker housing; (5) provision of rental assistance for low income persons not otherwise served by an existing rental assistance program; and (6) the disposition of any real property acquired pursuant to this Act. Sets forth a formula to be used by the Secretary in determining the amount to be allocated to each State, which takes into account the population, poverty, and substandard housing in rural areas of each State. Requires a State to pay from its own resources: (1) at least ten percent of the amount of Federal funds allocated to such State for rural housing activities during any three-year funding cycle; and (2) all administrative expenses, which shall separately be appropriated for such purpose, incurred by the State in carrying out its responsibilities under this Act (except that from the amounts received for distribution in rural areas, the State may deduct up to 50 percent of the costs it incurred in carrying out such responsibilities). Limits amounts so deducted to a maximum of two percent of the amount received. Directs the Secretary to allocate a State's determined amount of funds to the Farmers Home Administration office for the State for distribution in accordance with this Act where: (1) the State has elected, in such manner and before such time as the Secretary may prescribe, not to distribute such amounts; or (2) the State has failed to submit the required certifications. Sets forth provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex under any program funded by this Act. Directs the Secretary upon finding that a recipient of assistance has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this Act to terminate, reduce, or limit the availability of payments. Permits a recipient to file a petition for review of the Secretary's action in the appropriate United States Court of Appeals. Authorizes the Secretary in lieu of, or in addition to, any action which the Secretary initiates, to refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that a civil action be instituted. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress annually concerning this Act. Gives congressional consent to States to enter into agreements for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in support of housing planning and programs carried out under this Act as they pertain to interstate areas. Title III: Congressional Review of Rural Housing Rulemaking - Requires the Secretary to transmit to specified rural housing committees all final congressional rules, with specified exceptions (including emergency rules). Prohibits such rules from taking effect if: (1) within 45 days after Congress receives a rule, either committee reports or is discharged from considering a concurrent resolution disapproving such rule; (2) within 30 days after such a resolution is reported or discharged, either House adopts it; and (3) within 30 days after one House adopts such resolution, the other House adopts it. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for consideration of such resolutions."
