    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment (without written report)) National Health Service Corps Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to redefine \"health manpower shortage area.\" Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in establishing designation criteria, to consider the unmet demand for health services by individuals in an area and the likelihood that such demand will be met within two years. Revises the procedures for designation of a health manpower shortage area. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate State and local agencies before the proposed designation. Requires the Secretary to determine that there is a continued demand, as well as need, for manpower before assigning health corps personnel to a health manpower shortage area. Eliminates the authority of the Secretary to: (1) waive the cost sharing requirement for any entity located in an area in which a significant percentage of individuals are unable to pay for services; and (2) provide for the furnishing of services without charge. Requires Corps members to provide services to the maximum feasible extent in a manner which is cooperative with and not competitive with other health care providers. Extends the authorization of appropriations through fiscal year 1984 for the National Health Service Corps program. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the malpractice insurance for, and a partial income supplement to, individuals who choose an independent practice (formerly private practice) option. Makes specified mandatory responsibilities of the Secretary optional. Eliminates: (1) certain reporting requirements; and (2) the penalty for persons who fail to accept an awarded scholarship. Requires any new or continuing National Health Service scholarship contract after September 80, 1981, to provide for a loan agreement conversion at the Secretary's option. Requires the Secretary to determine that an individual's services will not be needed in a health manpower shortage area before such a conversion may be made. States that the Secretary may enter into National Health Service Corps contracts only as provided for in appropriation Acts."
