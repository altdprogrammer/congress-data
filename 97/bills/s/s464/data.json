Redefines requirements for a private operating foundation, for purposes of the exemption of such foundation from the tax on undistributed income, to eliminate the \"assets test\" which requires a private operating foundation to use a substantial percentage of its assets for the active conduct of its exempt purpose. Exempts private foundations from the taxes on taxable expenditures in cases where such foundations make grants to organizations not exceeding $10,000 in a taxable year. Redefines \"members of family\" for purposes of identifying persons who are disqualified from entering into specified transactions with a private foundation under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Establishes standards for reliance by private foundations upon determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the status of organizations (exempt from expenditure responsibility requirements) to which such foundations have made grants."
