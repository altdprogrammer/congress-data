Prohibits a school from receiving more than three grants after fiscal year 1981. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1984 for the Health Education Assistance Loans Program. Makes nursing students eligible for them. Increases the annual and aggregate loan limits available to other health professions students. Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services to repay part of a loan for a person practicing in a health manpower shortage area. Repeals the 50 percent limit on loan recipients in a given class. Permits (rather than requires) the Secretary to make loan repayments for service in health manpower shortage areas.

Permits service obligations to be fulfilled under the Departments of Health and Human Services or Defense, the Veterans' Administration, or State or local entities. Eliminates the freshman priority. Permits the Secretary to release persons from NHSC service if they agree to pay back from one to three times the amount of scholarship money they received. Allows the private practice option to be used in any health manpower shortage area specified by the Secretary. Authorizes special grants to encourage private practice in health manpower shortage areas. Requires a two-year minimum commitment. Gives priority to NHSC obligees. Limits grants to a maximum of $25,000.
