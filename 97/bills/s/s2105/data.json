    "text": "Title I: Public Employee Retirement Income Security - Public Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1981 - Establishes Federal reporting and disclosure requirements and fiduciary standards for certain State and local government retirement plans. Extends the requirements of this Act to all public employee pension plans except: (1) those covered and not exempted under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); (2) unfunded plans maintained by the employer primarily to provide deferred compensation for select management or highly compensated employees; (3) severance pay plans; (4) certain coverage agreements entered into under the Social Security Act; (5) certain individual retirement accounts or annuities, annuity plans, State deferred compensation plans, and other plans under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; and (6) plans maintained solely to comply with applicable workers' compensation or disability insurance laws. Subtitle A: Reporting and Disclosure - Requires that plan administrators submit, within a specified period, registration statements to the Board of Directors of the Employee Benefit Administration (established under title II), unless registration statements filed for a plan under Internal Revenue Code provisions still accurately reflect the status of the plan. Exempts a plan from the requirements of this Act if the Board determines that such plan is subject to State law imposing substantially equivalent requirements, with adequate provision for State administration and for collection of annual reports to be provided to the Board. Requires that a summary plan description apprising participants and their beneficiaries of their rights and obligations be published with respect to each plan. Specifies the content of such description. Requires that a summary plan description be updated at least once every ten years. Requires that an annual report be published with respect to each plan. Requires that each annual report include specified general information and a financial statement. Requires that annual reports for specified types of plans include actuarial statements and/or reports of insurance organizations. Requires actuarial valuations of plans at least once every three plan years, and more often if necessary. Directs plan administrators to provide the following information to participants and beneficiaries: (1) the summary plan description; (2) a summary description of any material modification in the terms of the plan; and (3) updated summary plan descriptions (for those whose future benefits may be affected by plan amendments). Directs plan administrators to furnish to any participant or beneficiary, upon written request, a statement indicating: (1) total accumulated plan benefits; (2) the extent to which, and the expected earliest date on which, such benefits are or will become vested pension benefits; and (3) the total accumulated contributions made by the participant. Directs plan administrators to provide to any participant or beneficiary who requests withdrawal of contributions, payment of benefits, or a benefit election, a written explanation of the effects of such action on remaining plan benefits. Requires plan administrators to file with the Board: (1) the annual report, within a specified period; and (2) upon request, any other plan-related document. Sets forth: (1) conditions under which such filings may be provided to the public; and (2) penalties for violations of such conditions. Authorizes the Board to: (1) reject such filings, under specified conditions; and (2) take specified appropriate actions if a revised and satisfactory filing is not submitted within 45 days. Sets forth requirements for retention of plan records. Requires plans covered by this Act to establish claims procedures that provide participants with adequate written notice and explanation of benefit denials and reasonable opportunity for full and fair review. Authorizes the Board to: (1) prescribe alternative methods of plan compliance with any requirement of this title; and (2) exempt any plan or class of plans from any such requirement (if necessary, in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this Act). Directs the Board to consider recommendations of the Advisory Council on Governmental Plans, established under this Act, before issuing such exemptions or prescribing such alternative compliance methods. Subtitle B: Fiduciary Responsibility - Requires plans covered by this Act to provide for one or more fiduciaries and to include: (1) any funding policy which has been established; (2) procedures for amendment and for the allocation of responsibility for the plan's operation and administration; and (3) specification of the benefit provisions. States that all assets shall be held in trust by one or more trustees, with certain exceptions. Requires a fiduciary to discharge his or her duties for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan, with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent man would exercise in like circumstances. Directs a fiduciary to diversify the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. Sets forth the circumstances under which a fiduciary is liable for the breach of a co-fiduciary with respect to the same plan. Requires trustees holding assets of a plan to use reasonable care to prevent a co-trustee from committing a breach and to manage and control jointly the assets, unless allocation of responsibility is authorized by the trust agreement. Prohibits specified types of transactions between a plan and parties-in-interest. Limits acquisition by a plan of qualifying employer securities, other employer obligations, and employer real property to ten percent of the fair market value of the assets of the plan. Provides for exemptions from prohibited transactions. Makes a fiduciary personally liable for the breach of any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this Act. Prohibits relieving fiduciaries of responsibilities under this Act, but permits purchases of fiduciary insurance.

Prohibits persons from taking retaliatory action against either a plan participant or a beneficiary for exercising any right under this Act, or from interfering with or preventing the exercise of such rights. Directs the Board to transmit specified information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Amends the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to transmit to an individual, upon request, specified information obtained under the Internal Revenue Code or under this Act (relating to deferred vested pension benefits).
