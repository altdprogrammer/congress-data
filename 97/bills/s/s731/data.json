    "text": "Energy Storage Research, Development, and Demonstration Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to prepare and transmit to specified Congressional committees a comprehensive program management plan for the research, development, and demonstration of energy storage technologies (processes to store electrical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical energy generated from any energy resource for end-use in transportation, building heating and cooling, industrial processes, and utility applications). Directs the Secretary in pursuing such program to: (1) initiate and accelerate research and development of new energy storage technologies; (2) solicit proposals and evaluate new or improved technology; (3) obtain scientific, technological, and economic information; and (4) coordinate such program with specified energy laws. Sets forth the contents of the program management plan. Requires that a technical panel on energy storage of the Energy Research Advisory Board be established to advise the Secretary on the conduct of the energy storage program. Requires the Secretary to make available to domestic industry and universities technical information on such program, except where such information involves trade secrets or proprietary information. Directs the Secretary to maintain a program to provide public information and educational materials on energy storage. Directs the Secretary to provide realistic and adequate opportunities for small business concerns to participate in energy storage programs. Requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the energy storage program. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982 to 1986."
