    "text": "Acid Deposition Study and Sulfur Emission Limitation Act of 1982 - Amends title I (Air Pollution Prevention and Control) of the Clean Air Act to establish a program of acid deposition analysis and mitigation. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, within the five-fiscal-year period following the enactment of this Act, to report on acid deposition to specified congressional committees. Sets forth requirements relating to such report. Directs the Administrator to solicit data, views, and comments from State and other Federal agencies which are carrying out studies and research relating to acid deposition. Encourages State Governors to: (1) establish and designate appropriate regional acid deposition corridors comprising several States; and (2) negotiate appropriate measures to reduce emissions of acid deposition pollutants, taking into consideration actions taken and planned by various States and Canada to control sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, future economic growth in the corridors, employment impact, environmental endangerment, consumer costs, and equity among States. Directs the Administrator to cooperate with and to provide technical assistance for such State efforts. Prohibits the Administrator from approving State implementation plan revisions, during the five-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, which would increase the annual allowable emissions of sulfur dioxide for any existing major stationary source. Sets forth exemptions from such prohibitions where: (1) the revised plan requires reduction of annual allowable emissions of sulfur dioxide from one or more other stationary sources in the State and such reduction is equal to, or greater than, such increase; (2) the increase is less than a deminimum amount established for stationary source construction or modification; (3) there is conversion from burning petroleum products or natural gas to the use of coal, or coal mixed with any other fuel, as the primary energy source; (4) modifications based on required monitoring and adopted pursuant to a consent decree entered into prior to enactment of this Act; and (5) specified sulfur dioxide emissions limitations are established. Authorizes the Administrator, directly or through grants to any State or interstate agency, to develop, refine, demonstrate, and implement methods of: (1) neutralizing or restoring the buffering capacity of acid altered bodies of water that can no longer support game fish species; and (2) removing from bodies of water toxic metals or other toxic substances mobilized by acid deposition. Permits inclusion in such grants of amounts necessary for reports, plans, and specifications. Prohibits such grants being made for any project: (1) in an amount exceeding 75 percent of costs; or (2) that involves bodies of water that did not contain game fish as established by State law prior to 1970. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for the five fiscal years following the date of enactment of this Act, in order to prepare the report on acid deposition and to make grants to State or interstate agencies."
