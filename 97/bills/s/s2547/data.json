    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal provisions which allow distributions made in partial liquidation of a corporation to be treated as part payment in exchange for the shareholders stock (i.e. capital gains) rather than taxed as dividends at ordinary income rates. Disallows the nonrecognition of gain by a corporation which distributes appreciated property in redemption of its stock in the case of: (1) complete redemptions of the stock of a ten-percent shareholder; (2) redemptions of stock of a 50 percent or more subsidiary of the redeeming corporation; and (3) distributions pursuant to antitrust judgments. Provides that redemption of stock attributable to a corporation's ceasing to conduct an active trade or business shall be treated as an exchange and not taxed as a dividend."
