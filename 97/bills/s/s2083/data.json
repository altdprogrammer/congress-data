    "text": "Royalty Collection Incentive Act of 1982 - Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to designate a principal lessee with respect to any oil or gas lease issued under such Act. Makes the principal lessee responsible for making all royalty and lease payments under such lease. Directs the Attorney General at the request of the Secretary of the Interior to bring a civil action to enforce any law governing any oil or gas lease or any term of such a lease. Sets forth a maximum penalty for failure to comply with such laws or lease terms. Sets an additional fine of a five percent interest payment above the current interest rate for any overdue royalty payments. Provides a maximum fine of $100,000, a maximum prison term of the ten years, or both for any person who knowingly and willfully, with respect to any oil or gas lease issued under such Act: (1) violates any lease term; (2) makes any false statement or representation; (3) falsifies or tampers with any record; or (4) reveals confidential information. Requires convictions for such willful violations to result in the forfeiture of the lease held by the person convicted. Makes officers and agents of corporations prosecuted for such activities subject to the same penalties and prison terms."
