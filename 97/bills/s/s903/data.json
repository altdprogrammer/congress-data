    "text": "Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Redefines such offense to include the use or carrying of a knife to commit a Federal felony. Eliminates the current requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Adds as a new offense using a firearm or knife transported in commerce to commit any State crime punishable by more than one year's imprisonment or carrying such a weapon unlawfully during commission of such offense. Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to five years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years), ten years' imprisonment for a second offense (currently, two to 25 years for a second or subsequent offense), and 15 years for a third or subsequent offense. Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences."
