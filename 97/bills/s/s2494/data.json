    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended) Water Resources Research Act of 1982 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to assist the work of any water resources research and technology institute, center, or equivalent agency established in the States in accordance with this Act. States that each such institute shall: (1) have responsibility for planning, conducting, and/or arranging for competent research in relation to water resources; and (2) cooperate with other colleges and universities in the State in order to develop a statewide program designed to resolve State and regional water and related land problems. Requires each institute, prior to the receipt of funds each fiscal year, to submit to the Secretary a water research program. Permits the Secretary to make grants to each designated institute matched at specified rates by non-Federal dollars. Authorizes appropriations for such grants through FY 1987. Permits the Secretary to make additional grants to other qualified institutions and agencies of local or State government for research concerning any aspect of a water-related problem which the Secretary may deem to be in the national interest. Declares that for the purposes of this Act the term \"state\" includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Repeals the Water Research and Development Act of 1978. Authorizes appropriations for such additional grants and for administration of grants through FY 1987."
