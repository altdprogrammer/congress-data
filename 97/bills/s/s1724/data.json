    "text": "Federal Employees' Compensation Act Antifraud Amendments of 1981 - Prohibits the Secretary of Labor from reimbursing a provider of medical supplies or services to injured Federal employees upon determining that such provider: (1) knowingly has made a false statement on the application for reimbursement; (2) has submitted a substantially high charge without good cause; (3) has furnished an unnecessary service or a service which does not meet professionally recognized standards; (4) has been convicted or indicted for an offense connected with providing a medical service or supply; or (5) has been excluded from a State or Federal medical program. Requires that such a determination be based on specific findings of fact. Directs the Secretary to provide notice of such findings and an opportunity for a hearing to the affected provider. States that the Secretary shall not reimburse a beneficiary for expenses accumulated after the beneficiary receives such notice. Permits a provider to obtain a review of a final decision made by the Secretary after a hearing by commencing a civil action in a U.S. district court. Directs the Secretary to adopt a schedule of reasonable fees for medical services and supplies provided in specific geographic areas. Prohibits the Secretary from paying charges exceeding the scheduled amount unless the Secretary determines such charges are reasonable in a particular case. Prohibits the payment of Federal compensation for injuries to any convicted felon while incarcerated unless such felon is participating in an approved rehabilitation program."
