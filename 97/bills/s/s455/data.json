Directs the Committee to advise the United States Postal Service regarding the approval of bids for the printing, distribution, and sale of postage stamps containing the logos of domestic business enterprises. Authorizes the Postal Service to enter into a contract to print, distribute, and sell an issue of 2,600,000 of such stamps for any domestic business enterprise for a minimum price of five cents per stamp. Sets forth specifications for acceptable business logos. Requires the Committee to advertise the availability of such stamps, to review the bids received for each issue, and to recommend the bids which would be the most economically advantageous to the Postal Service. Directs the Committee and the Postal Service to reject all bids for an issue if such action is in the public interest. Declares that all of the revenues from the sale of such stamps shall be deposited into the Postal Service Fund. Requires the Postal Service to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the sale of such stamps in raising revenues."
