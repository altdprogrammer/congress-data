Directs the Secretary to assure that a broad spectrum of senior citizens, localities, and project types is represented by the groups selected to receive assistance. Sets forth the required scope of such demonstration projects. Directs the Secretary to coordinate and jointly target resources with other appropriate agencies (such as the Administration on Aging of the Department of Health and Human Services). Directs the Secretary to transmit to Congress by December 31, 1982, proposed regulations to carry out such program. Prohibits the Secretary from entering into any obligations pursuant to this Act prior to the expiration of 30 days following such transmittal. Directs the Secretary to transmit by December 31, 1983, a final report to the Congress on the activities undertaken pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to use a specified amount, to the extent approved in an appropriation Act, of the additional authority provided for annual contributions contracts for public housing projects for FY 1983 to carry out the older Americans housing demonstration program authorized by this Act."
