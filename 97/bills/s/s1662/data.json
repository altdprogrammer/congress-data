Requires the Secretary to inform the Governor and the legislature and the eligible Indian tribes of any State in which a potential site for an interim storage facility is located of the investigation and selection of such site for such facility. Requires the Secretary to enter into negotiations with the State and any eligible Indian tribes at the time of site selection to establish a cooperative agreement under which the State and Indian tribes shall have the right to participate in a process of consultation and concurrence, based on public health and safety and environmental concerns, in all stages of the development, operation, and closure of an interim storage facility. Directs the Secretary to report periodically to Congress on the status of such negotiations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) suspend work on a facility if the Governor of a State or an eligible Indian tribe objects; and (2) transmit such objections, with recommendations, to the President. Directs the Secretary to terminate such work unless the President, within 90 days of being notified by the Secretary, determines such facility is essential to the national interest. Amends the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to provide that the NRC shall have licensing and related regulatory authority over storage facilities for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from foreign reactors whose transfer is authorized under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Subjects the transportation of spent fuel under this Act to licensing and regulation by the NRC as provided under existing law. Requires the Secretary, the NRC, and Federal officials to encourage and expedite the effective use of existing storage facilities and the addition of needed new storage capacity at civilian nuclear powerplant sites. Directs the Secretary to establish a cooperative program to assist private development of alternate technologies for spent fuel storage which can be licensed by the NRC on a generic basis for use at all civilian nuclear powerplant sites. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to cooperate with, and provide technical assistance to, non-nuclear weapon states in the field of spent fuel storage and disposal. Requires the Secretary and the NRC to publish a joint notice of such policy in the Federal Register. Requires the joint notice to be updated and reissued annually for five succeeding years. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) inform the governments of non-nuclear weapon states and, where feasible, organizations operating nuclear powerplants in such states of the U.S. policy; and (2) solicit their expressions of interest in participating in expanded U.S. cooperation and technical assistance programs in these fields. Requires the President to include funding requests for such programs in the budget presentation for the Department of Energy and the NRC for FY 1984 through 1989. Permits an applicant for a license or license amendment to expand the spent fuel storage capacity at a civilian nuclear powerplant site to petition the NRC for an interim license or license amendment prior to a required hearing on the application. Authorizes the NRC to issue an interim license or license amendment if: (1) all legal requirements other than a required hearing are met; (2) there will be adequate protection of the public health and safety and the environment during the interim period; and (3) refusal to grant the petition will prevent the petitioner from maintaining a full core reserve storage capability at the powerplant site. Prohibits the NRC from issuing an interim license or license amendment for the first application to expand onsite spent fuel storage capacity by a new technology not previously approved for use at a nuclear powerplant. Sets forth administrative review requirements with respect to an application for a license or license amendment to expand spent fuel storage capacity at a civilian nuclear powerplant site. Prohibits the NRC from considering spent fuel storage in away-from-reactor facilities as spent fuel storage alternatives.
