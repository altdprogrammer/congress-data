Directs the FCC to require that essential telephones provide internal means for effective use with specially designed hearing aids. Defines \"essential telephones\" to mean only coin operated telephones, emergency telephones, and other telephones frequently needed by persons using hearing aids. Directs the FCC to establish the necessary technical standards. Directs the FCC to establish the labeling requirements necessary to provide adequate information for consumers on the compatibility between telephones and hearing aids. Directs the FCC to consider in rulemaking decisions the costs and benefits to all telephone users, including those with and without hearing impairments. Directs the FCC to ensure that regulations adopted to implement this Act do not impair development of improved technology. Requires the rules and regulations required by this Act to be completed within one year after enactment. Directs the FCC to review such rules and regulations periodically. Permits common carriers or connecting carriers to provide specialized terminal equipment needed by persons with hearing, speech, vision, or mobility impairments. Permits such carriers to recover in its tariffs for regulated service the costs for such equipment not charged to users of the equipment. Directs the FCC to delegate to each State commission the authority to enforce the FCC regulations on telephone service for the hearing impaired. Amends the Public Broadcasting Amendments Act of 1981 to change the length of the terms of new members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to ensure that the political balance of the Board is retained. Amends the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to delete the requirement that 50 percent of all new stock issued by the Communications Satellite Corporation must be reserved for purchase by authorized communications carriers."
