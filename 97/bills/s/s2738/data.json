    "text": "Math and Science Education Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers an income tax credit for compensation paid to: (1) precollege mathematics and science teachers hired for the summer months for employment which provides experience in the applied use of high technology; and (2) permanent employees who teach precollege mathematics or science at a public school without compensation from such school. Sets the amount of such credit at the sum of: (1) 50 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to teachers employed for the summer months; plus (2) 100 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to permanent employees who teach at public schools. Limits the amount of compensation paid to a permanent employee which may be taken into account to $1,000 multiplied by the number of months such employee teaches in a public school. Requires that teachers hired for the summer months must be paid at a weekly rate equal to or greater than the weekly rate of the teaching salary of such teacher. Requires that permanent employees who teach at public schools must teach at an elementary or secondary school for at least ten hours per week (at least five hours of which must be actual instruction in the classroom) at the request of the school district administrators."
