Title II: Export Financing - Amends the Export - Import Bank Act of 1945 to establish staggered, ten-year terms of office for the Bank directors. Requires the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to consider limitations on Bank activities when considering appropriations for international trade activities rather than when considering foreign assistance activities. Title III: Export - Related Tax Policy - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the earned income exclusion for citizens working abroad, who are bona fide residents of a foreign country, from an annual rate of $20,000 to $50,000 plus 50 percent of such individual's compensation which exceeds $50,000 but does not exceed $75,000, if such persons qualify as bona fide residents for certain specified periods. Allows separate exclusions to married individuals who are both working overseas, although one's excess exclusion cannot be used against income earned by the other. Provides a tax exclusion for such individuals for the amount by which such individual's housing expenses exceed 16 percent of a GS-14, step 1 salary level for a Federal employee. Permits such individuals to include in the computation of housing expenses the costs of a second foreign household if such individual's family resides outside the United States but not with the individual because of adverse living conditions where the individual resides.

Excludes from an employee's gross income any lodging furnished the employee by an employer in a camp which meets specified requirements. Repeals the current provisions relating to deductions for certain expenses of living abroad. Provides that the foreign bad debt loss deduction shall not exceed the greater of 15 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income from exports, or two percent of the taxpayer's export receivables outstanding at the close of the taxable year.

Amends the Foreign Trade Zones Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to approve the duty-free entry of machinery, materials, and fuels to be used for the production of goods in a foreign trade zone if such goods are not subsequently entered into U.S. customs territory.

Requires the Foreign Trade Zones Board to include in its annual report to Congress a summary of activities and proposals to increase the use of foreign trade zones to expand U.S. exports.

Sets forth the procedures for describing such permissible conduct and disclosing such descriptions. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to intervene in such suits and to provide legal assistance to exporters.

Requires only good faith efforts at ensuring compliance by issuers who hold 50 percent or less of the equity of domestic or foreign firms. Transfers from the Security and Exchange Commission to the Department of Justice jurisdiction to enforce the antibribery prohibitions of the FCPA with respect to issuers.
