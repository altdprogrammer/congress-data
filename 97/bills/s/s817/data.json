    "text": "Constitutional Convention Implementation Act of 1981 - Sets forth procedures for holding constitutional conventions for proposing amendments to the Constitution. Requires either House of Congress to agree to a concurrent resolution calling for a convention whenever it determines that at least two-thirds of the States have submitted within a seven-year period valid applications for the calling of a constitutional convention upon the same subject. Requires that the convention be convened within four months of the adoption of the resolution. Entitles each State to the same number of delegates at such convention as it has Senators and Representatives in Congress. Stipulates that no Senator, Representative, or other person holding office under the United States shall be appointed as delegate. Provides that the person who is senior in years of service as a chief justice of the highest courts of the States shall convene the convention. Prohibits the appropriation of Federal funds for the specific purpose of paying convention expenses. Authorizes the convention to be conducted in accordance with such rules as it may adopt. Prohibits such convention from proposing any amendment of a general subject different from that stated in the concurrent resolution. Requires the presiding officer of the convention to submit any proposed amendment to Congress. Authorizes Congress to disapprove by concurrent resolution any amendment which differs from the general subjects described in the concurrent resolution. Directs the Administrator of General Services to transmit to the States copies of the proposed amendment and copies of any concurrent resolution agreed to by both Houses of Congress prescribing this mode of ratification. Provides that an amendment shall become valid when ratified by three-fourths of the States. Permits a State to rescind its ratification, except when valid ratifications by three-fourths of the States exist."
