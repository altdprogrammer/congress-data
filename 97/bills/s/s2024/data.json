    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny tax-exempt status to organizations maintaining schools with racially discriminatory policies. Denies income tax and estate and gift tax deductions for any contributions or gifts made to organizations maintaining schools with racially discriminatory policies. Defines \"racially discriminatory policy\" as a refusal to admit students of all races to the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally made available to students by the organization, or a refusal to administer its educational policies, admissions policies, or other programs in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of race. Exempts from such definition an admissions policy of a school or a program of religious training or worship that is limited or grants preferences to members of a particular religious organization or belief provided that no such policy or preference is based upon race or upon a belief that requires discrimination on the basis of race. States that the term \"race\" shall include color or national origin."
