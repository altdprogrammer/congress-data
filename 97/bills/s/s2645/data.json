Permits the expenditure of funds for planning and administration within the authority to construct or convert any Reserve facility. Permits the advance of public moneys for such purpose. Permits permanent or temporary improvements on lands to which title is not yet approved and on lands which are held temporarily. Increases from $175,000 to $200,000 the ceiling on Reserve facilities requiring notification of the appropriate congressional committees. Reduces the period of notification from 30 to 21 days. Expands the exemption from such requirements to include projects whose location, purpose, scope, and cost remain the same or within prescribed limits as when authorized. Requires annual authorization of appropriations for military construction of Reserve facilities, architectural and engineering services and construction design for all military constuction projects, and advances for the construction of defense access roads. Expands the authority to acquire real property to include authority to make surveys and acquire interests through gift, purchase, or exchange. Limits the amount of increase in cost for land acquisition for unusual, unanticipated variations in cost or reduction in scope of the project. Permits an exemption with the approval of the congressional committees after 21 days notice or upon receipt of approval. Codifies other permanent provisions of law concerning the use and development of energy resources on military lands."
