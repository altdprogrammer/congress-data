Requires the Secretary to pay a benefit check presented for payment after it has been credited to one of the trust funds if it is otherwise proper. Directs the Secretary to transfer funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to reimburse them for the total amount of unnegotiated benefit checks."
