    "text": "Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code (Self-employment taxes provisions) to allow a householder to elect coverage under the OASDI program as a self-employed individual. Defines a householder to be one who during any calendar quarter: (1) maintains or conducts the affairs of a household without a wage or salary; and (2) is not less than 18 years old. Sets forth the method for determining a householder's earnings for purposes of OASDI coverage under this Act. Makes an individual's election of such coverage for any taxable year irrevocable. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act. Requires the recomputation of the primary insurance amount of any individual whose entitlement to OASDI benefit for the month in which this Act is enacted is based on the earnings of a householder. Permits the requirement that proof of support be filed within two years after the death of the insured to establish OASDI eligibility to be satisfied by the filing of such proof within two years of enactment of this Act in the case of an individual whose benefit entitlement is based on the earnings of a householder."
