    "text": "Handgun Crime Control Act of 1981 - Title I: Amendments to Chapter 44 of Title 18, United States Code - Amends the Federal criminal code to direct the Attorney General to approve for manufacture, assembly, importation, sale, or transfer any handgun model which is generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes. Makes it unlawful for any licensed manufacturer, importer, dealer, or collector to manufacture, assemble, sell, deliver, or transfer any handgun (other than a curio or relic) which is not an approved model. Makes it unlawful for any non-licensee to sell or transfer any handgun (other than curio or relic) unless such person knows or has reasonable cause to believe such handgun is an approved model. Prohibits a pawnbroker from being licensed as a dealer in handguns or handgun ammunition. Directs the Attorney General to review State laws providing for permits to carry and purchase handguns and certify those meeting specified standards. Allows an individual possessing a permit under a certified State law to purchase a handgun if certain requirements are met. Makes it unlawful for a licensed dealer to transfer a handgun to a person not holding a permit under a certified State law unless certain procedures are followed. Requires in any such case that the transferee appear in person at the dealer's business premises. Requires the dealer, before delivery of the handgun, to forward a copy of a sworn statement by the transferee to the chief local law enforcement officer of the transferee's place of residence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for an identity and record check. Prohibits delivery until 21 days after submission of the sworn statement. Makes it unlawful for any licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector to sell to the same person, or for any non-licensee to purchase, three or more handguns during a period of one year without the prior approval of the Attorney General. Makes it unlawful for any person to fail to report the loss, theft, or disappearance of a handgun in his possession to the authorities within 24 hours after discovering such loss. Requires all licensed importers, manufacturers, and dealers to maintain accurate records of all handgun transfers. Makes whoever negligently transfers a handgun in violation of this Act civilly liable for the death or injury of an individual as a result of the use of such handgun by the transferee during commission of an offense. Makes it unlawful for any person to transport any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce if such transportation violates a State law in a place through which the firearm was shipped or an ordinance at the place of sale, delivery, or other disposition. Increases the license fee for handgun dealers from $10 to $500 and for manufacturers and importers from $50 to $5,000. Makes it unlawful for any illegal alien, dishonorably discharged member of the Armed Forces, or U.S. citizen who has renounced such citizenship to possess, transport, or receive any firearm or ammunition. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 to revise and increase the mandatory penalties for using or carrying a firearm during commission of a Federal felony. Deletes the requirement that the firearm be carried \"illegally.\" Increases the additional penalty imposed for such offense to two to ten years' imprisonment for a first offense (currently, one to ten years) and five to 25 years for a second offense (currently, two to 25 years). Extends to first offenders the stipulations, currently applicable only to second offenders, that the court not suspend any sentence, grant probation, or impose concurrent sentences, unless the court finds the existence of enumerated mitigating circumstances. Adds a term of parole ineligibility as an additional restriction on first offenders (two years) and subsequent offenders (five years). Title II: Gun Control Functions Transferred to the Attorney General - Transfers to the Attorney General all functions of the Secretary of the Treasury under the Gun Control Act of 1968. Establishes the Firearms Safety and Abuse Control Administration within the Department of Justice. Requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on the activities of the Administration. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, in consultation with the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, to report on the intergovernmental problems involved in controlling illicit handgun traffic and the effectiveness of the Gun Control Act of 1968."
