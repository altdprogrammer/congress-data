    "text": "(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 97-161) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants for research and projects relating to adolescent pregnancy and parenthood. Authorizes the Secretary to make demonstration grants for care and prevention projects. Prohibits funds from being used for adolescent family planning services (other than counseling and referral) if similar services are available in the community. Requires grantees to use an income-based fee schedule approved by the Secretary. Sets forth: (1) grantee priorities; (2) grant amount factors; and (3) application requirements. Prohibits grants for more than five years duration. Sets up a decreasing maximum Federal financial participation (which the Secretary may waive). Requires an applicant to submit a copy of each application to the Governor. Requires a grantee to make periodic project reports to the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to coordinate Federal policies and programs relating to the prevention of adolescent pregnancies, including assistance to State and local entities receiving Federal aid. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts for research projects. Limits such projects to a maximum of five years and an annual amount of $100,000. Requires the Secretary to: (1) coordinate such projects with the National Institutes of Health; and (2) establish a panel to review grant and contract applications. Requires research grantees to make project reports to the Secretary. Directs that between one and three percent of appropriated funds be used for program evaluation. Authorizes specified appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1984. Requires that at least two thirds of these appropriations be used for demonstration projects. Prohibits funds under this Act from being used for abortion related purposes, except for research concerning the consequences of abortion. Repeals titles VI - VIII (adolescent pregnancy program) of the Health Services and Centers Amendments of 1978."
