    "text": "National Science Foundation Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1982 - Authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for fiscal year 1982 for the following categories: (1) mathematical and physical sciences; (2) engineering; (3) biological, behavioral, and social sciences; (4) astronomical, atmospheric, earth, and ocean sciences; (5) ocean drilling programs; (6) Antarctic research programs; (7) scientific, technological, and international affairs; (8) cross-directorate programs; (9) program development and management; and (10) science and engineering education. Limits the amount of authorizations which may be expended for consultation and for expenses of the Foundation incurred outside the United States. Permits the transfer of funds among categories if the chairmen of the House Committee on Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources each write the Director of the Foundation that there is no objection to the transfer or 30 days have passed after such committees were notified of the proposed transfer. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to keep such committees fully and currently informed with respect to all the Foundation's activities."
