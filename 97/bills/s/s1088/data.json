Directs the Secretary to consult with other Federal agencies to eliminate duplication or conflict of activities and to incorporate project findings into the programs of such other Federal agencies. Limits Federal assistance to 80 percent of project cost, unless the Secretary determines that more is necessary to further the purposes of this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring more than a 20 percent non-Federal contribution. Requires that such projects be in addition to and not in substitution for comparable activities previously carried out without Federal assistance. Permits the Secretary to waive this requirement in certain circumstances. Provides for technical assistance and training for such projects. Directs the Secretary to establish overall plans and make public announcements concerning research, demonstration, and pilot projects. Directs the Secretary to make economic development grants to the governing bodies of Indian tribes, bands, or groups residing on Federal or State reservations, including Alaskan Native villages or groups, for employment and training programs for tribal or village government employees, and for other programs to enable such governing bodies to assume responsibility for local economic and social well-being. Directs the Secretary to: (1) promulgate interim regulations for allotment of such funds in FY 1983 to eligible governing bodies; (2) establish a formula, with specified considerations, for such allotment in FY 1984; and (3) make emergency grants, with reports to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires submission of plans to: (1) the appropriate governing body of an Indian reservation or Alaskan Native village; or (2) State and local officials, when a project is not on or in an Indian reservation or Alaska Native village or Hawaiian homestead. Sets forth provisions for: (1) records and audits; (2) appeals, notice, and hearing; (3) evaluation; (4) delegation of authority; and (5) regulations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 and 1984 to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1983 and 1984 for grants to tribal and village governments for economic development."
