    "text": "(Measure passed House, amended) Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to permit a foreign ship to process fish within the internal waters of a State only if: (1) such ship is under the flag of a country with which the United States has a fishing treaty; and (2) the ship's owner or operator has applied for and received the Governor's permission to engage in such activities. Prohibits a Governor from granting such permission if he or she determines that State fish processors possess and will utilize the capacity to process all of the U.S. fish harvested from the concerned fishery. Requires such ships to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws. Defines \"fish processing\" as processing and other related fishing activities, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, or transportation. Defines \"internal waters of a State\" to include all waters within a State's boundaries except those seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured. Makes it illegal for a foreign ship to engage in fish processing in U.S. waters except as authorized by this Act. Makes this Act effective as of June 1, 1982."
