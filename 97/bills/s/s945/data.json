    "date": "1981-04-08", 
    "text": "Title I: Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act Amendments - Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to repeal: (1) the low income farm ownership loan program; (2) the maximum five percent interest rate on disaster emergency loans for persons unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere; (3) the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to make and insure disaster loans to applicants who can obtain credit elsewhere; and (4) the minimum 25 percent of all insured farm ownership and operating loans reserved for low- income, limited-resource borrowers. Title II: Small Business Act Amendments - Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) specify the availability of Small Business Administration disaster loans to refinance any mortgage against a totally destroyed or substantially damaged home or business concern, under certain conditions; (2) end the availability of loans for economic disasters for natural, physical disasters declared by the Secretary of Agriculture only, or certified to the SBA Administrator by the governor of a State; (3) condition the extension of a loan or guarantee upon the Administrator's finding that reasonable credit is not otherwise available; and (4) modify the formula for the determination of interest rates (currently limited to the average annual interest rate on all interest-bearing obligations of the United States) to allow such rates to rise above a minimum level keyed to the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States, plus a one percent additional charge. Limits the total amount of loans to any borrower to $500,000 for each disaster, unless the borrower constitutes a major source of employment in the disaster area."
