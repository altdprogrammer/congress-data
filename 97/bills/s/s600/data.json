    "text": "Federal Constitutional Convention Amendment Act - Sets forth procedures for holding constitutional conventions for proposing amendments to the Constitution. Requires that both Houses of Congress agree to a concurrent resolution calling for a convention whenever it determines that at least two-thirds of the States have submitted valid applications for the calling of a constitutional convention upon the same subject. Entitles each State to the same number of delegates at such convention as it has Senators and Representatives in Congress, with one delegate elected from each congressional district and two at large. Authorizes the convention to propose constitutional amendments by a majority vote of the total number of delegates. Provides that an amendment shall become valid when ratified by three-fourths of the States. Permits a State to rescind its ratification. Authorizes appropriations for the expenses of the convention."
