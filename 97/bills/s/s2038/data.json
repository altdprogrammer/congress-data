    "text": "Defense Procurement Training Demonstration Project Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Labor, to establish demonstration projects to provide training in skilled occupations for which there is a worker shortage adversely affecting defense procurement. Directs the Secretary of Labor to publish a list of skilled occupations in which there is a substantial shortage of workers. Defines a \"skilled occupation\" as one for which the normal training period is at least two years but for which a college degree is not required. Defines a substantial shortage of workers as one in which less than 80 percent of the anticipated demand for that skilled occupation, for a five year period, is trained or being trained. Directs the Secretary of Defense (the Secretary) to prepare a list of occupations, based on the Secretary of Labor's list, for which a shortage of workers will have an adverse effect on defense procurement. Requires the Secretary to establish such demonstration projects if the selected defense procurement contract: (1) involves the expenditure of at least $10,000,000; (2) requires the hiring of additional workers in any of the skilled occupations on the Secretary's list; and (3) requires the training of additional workers as critical for the timely completion of the contract work. Authorizes the Secretary to include in such defense procurement contracts, provisions to: (1) require the contractor to provide training in the skills the Secretary determines are necessary for the completion of the contract; and (2) specify the type of training. Requires the Secretary to assure an equitable geographic distribution of pilot demonstration projects. Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress, two and one-half years after enactment, a report on the demonstration projects. Amends the Defense Industrial Reserve Act to allow the donation of certain property directly to educational institutions or training schools."
