Enumerates factors to be considered by the court in determining the validity of claims. Prohibits any payments under this Act until such time as the claimant produces proof of the proper disposal of such goods. States that the amount of losses shall not include lost profits, distress sale proceeds, attorney fees, or interest on losses. Sets forth the measure of losses for producers, converters, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of Tris-treated sleepwear or the fabric yarn, or fiber. Prohibits class action claims. Subrogates the United States to a successful claimants' rights to recover losses. Bars claims under this Act unless begun within two years of enactment. Prohibits recovery by any claimant who knowingly exported Tris-treated products after June 14, 1978. Provides for the offset of any judgment obtained by a claimant against any unpaid loans owed to the Small Business Administration. States that nothing in this Act constitutes an admission by the United States of liability for any personal injuries resulting from the use of Tris-treated products."
