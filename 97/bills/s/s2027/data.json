    "text": "Acid Precipitation Accelerated Review and Reporting Act - Amends the Energy Security Act (title VII provisions also known as the \"Acid Precipitation Act of 1980\") to reduce the period covered by a comprehensive research plan from ten years to five years. Makes conforming amendments relating to implementation of, and authorization of appropriations for, the comprehensive research plan. Directs the Acid Precipitation Task Force to submit a final report, with detailed recommendations, within five years of enactment of the Energy Security Act. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to submit recommendations, to accompany the final report of the Task Force, for specific changes in law supported by scientific findings of the Task Force. Prohibits the Administrator from proposing or promulgating any rule to control sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide emissions if such rule would expand the Administrator's existing regulatory authority, before the final report is transmitted. Directs the Task Force to: (1) study fuel precombustion treatment and low-polluting combustion processes for reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions; and (2) solicit information from State agencies conducting acid deposition research."
