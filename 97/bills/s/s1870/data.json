Retains for such holding company the prohibition on acquisitions without SEC approval of public-utility company securities by any persons who are affiliates of such company. States that the exemption of a holding company shall not be affected by the ownership of a public- utility company by a public-utility subsidiary of such holding company if the holding company is predominantly a public-utility company whose operations do not extend beyond the State in which it is organized and States contiguous to such State."
