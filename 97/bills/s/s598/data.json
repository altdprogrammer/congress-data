Eliminates restrictions on such tax exclusion with respect to: (1) the dollar amount of such exclusion; (2) the taxable year to which the income earned abroad is attributed; (3) community income earned abroad; and (4) meals and lodgings provided by the employer. Repeals provisions added by the Tax Reform Act of 1976 which allow income tax deductions for various expenses related to living abroad."
