    "text": "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act Amendments of 1981 - Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to state that it is the policy of the United States to discourage and prevent the use of plutonium as a commercial reactor fuel. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit the transfer or licensing for export of certain nuclear facilities and materials to any foreign nation lacking the capability to reprocess spent nuclear fuel for commercial purposes unless such nation agrees not to obtain such capability or seek access to separated plutonium. Requires the United States to provide a nation which enters into such an agreement with an amount of enriched uranium reactor fuel with a certain total energy content. Amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to prohibit the transfer or licensing for export of certain nuclear facilities or materials until: (1) the President sends to Congress a report on U.S. nuclear non-proliferation policy, with a certification that such policy will significantly reduce the risks of nuclear proliferation; and (2) Congress approves such policy and concurs with the certification by concurrent resolution."
