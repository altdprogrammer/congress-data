    "text": "National Home Weatherization Act of 1981 - Allows a State to submit an annual grant application requesting financial assistance under this Act for energy assistance and weatherization programs authorized under the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act, the Emergency Energy Conservation Act, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the National Energy Extension Service Act, and any other Federal law. Requires that 65 percent of such assistance be used for low-income weatherization assistance programs unless the Governor determines that an insufficient or limited need for such assistance exists in such State. Sets forth the circumstances under which a State application will not be approved. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide financial and technical assistance to States and Indian tribes to fund energy programs and State energy plans. Requires a State to submit a State energy plan in order to receive assistance under this Act. Requires that State energy plans contain: (1) a plan for coordinating and apportioning responsibilities for development and implementation of the State energy plans; (2) an implementation plan for a low- income weatherization assistance program; (3) a plan to coordinate the administration of various Federal low-income energy assistance programs; (4) a plan and a description of the proposed uses of funds for the implementation of the State energy plan; (5) a description of State energy supply and demand and State energy conservation goals and policies; and (6) a description of how the State and local governments plan to implement any other State energy programs. Directs the Secretary to approve a State energy plan or modification thereto unless the plan or modification fails to comply with this Act or with Federal law. Requires Federal agencies which produce or consume significant quantities of energy within a State to provide energy-related information to the State upon request. Directs a State to hold public hearings on the development of its first State energy plan and any plan modifications. Requires that a State give priority to the needs of the poor, the handicapped, and the elderly in its State energy plan. Directs the Secretary to provide written notice of and an opportunity for a hearing concerning: (1) disapproval of a State application for assistance, a waiver request under this Act, or a State energy plan or plan modification; or (2) a finding that a recipient of assistance has not complied with this Act or any other law. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend financial assistance upon issuance of such a notice. Prohibits the payment of financial assistance for any State energy plan or other activities if the Secretary makes a final determination of noncompliance. Sets forth the allocation of the funds available under this Act. Restricts the expenditures of such funds. Directs the Secretary to reserve a portion of the funds annually for the benefit of Indian tribes. Limits the total amount allocated for any State in any year to ten percent of the total allocation for all the States. Requires a State receiving financial assistance to provide local governments and regional councils with funds commensurate with their responsibilities with respect to the State energy plan. Permits a State to participate in interstate or multistate organizations that coordinate State energy plans. Authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1982-1984."
