Prohibits local currencies owned by the United States from being made available for use outside the United States for defraying the expenses of a committee Member after: (1) the date of the primary in which the Member is a candidate for election to a Federal office (other than the Presidency) but has not been designated or elected as the nominee of a party in the general election; (2) the date of the general election when the Member is not re-elected; or (3) the earliest of the following; (a) announcement of the Member's intention not to be a candidate; (b) the primary for candidates for Representative in the Member's district; or (c) the adjournment sine die of the second regular session of the Congress."
