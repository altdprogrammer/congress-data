Makes it out of order in the House to consider any bill, resolution, or conference report subject to such amended rule unless: (1) it comprises only the items affecting the pay or benefits of Members; and (2) it takes effect at the beginning of the subsequent Congress. Requires the Committee on Rules, when reporting a resolution waiving any point of order relative to specified clauses of rule VIII, to clearly identify the subject matter of the point of order being waived and the clause of such rule."
