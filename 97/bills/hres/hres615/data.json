    "text": "Amends rule VIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require a recorded vote on final passage of legislation that adjusts the pay of Members, affects limitations on outside earned income, or provides tax credits or deductions for Members as a separate or distinct class. Excludes adjustments made under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 from such requirement. Makes it out of order in the House to consider any bill, resolution, or conference report subject to such amended rule unless: (1) it comprises only the items affecting the pay or benefits of Members; and (2) it takes effect at the beginning of the subsequent Congress. Requires the Committee on Rules, when reporting a resolution waiving any point of order relative to specified clauses of rule VIII, to clearly identify the subject matter of the point of order being waived and the clause of such rule."
