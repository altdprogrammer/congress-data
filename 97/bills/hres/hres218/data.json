Requires the committees to determine whether such programs: (1) are being implemented according to the intent of Congress; and (2) whether they should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated. Exempts the following committees from such oversight: the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on the Budget, the Committee on Rules, and the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. Prohibits, during such 21 day period, any consideration of legislation unless the Speaker, in consultation with the minority leader, permits exceptions for good cause."
