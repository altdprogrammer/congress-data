Authorizes the Subcommittee on Investigations to determine if a Member, officer, or employee has violated the Code of Official Conduct and to initiate proceedings against any such person before the Subcommittee on Adjudications. Sets forth the rules of procedure for such subcommittees after commencement of such proceedings. Prohibits any House action against any person charged with alleged violations of such Code unless the Subcommittee on Investigations has instituted its investigation within five years of the alleged violation. Allows the admission of private counsel for Members in disciplinary cases to the floor of the House during the pendency of such cases. Requires the Speaker of the House to appoint counsel from among the Members to represent any such Member on the House floor."
