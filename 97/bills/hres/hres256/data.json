    "text": "Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that all funds for committee staff expenses (except the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget) be provided in primary and additional expense resolutions. Authorizes the allocation of not less than one-third of committee funds for staff for the use of minority party staff members (except the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct). Makes technical amendments to the Rules to conform to the provisions of this resolution. Makes certain provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 which authorize congressional Committees on Appropriations to appoint staff, inapplicable to the House Committee on Appropriations until otherwise provided by law, or rule or resolution of the House of Representatives. Amends such Act to authorize congressional committees to provide financial assistance for specialized training to members of their nonclerical staff (currently only professional staff). Specifies certain resolutions which relate to the authority of committees to employ additional staff that, until otherwise provided by law, or rule or resolution of the House, shall not apply to sessions of Congress beginning with the second session of the 97th Congress."
