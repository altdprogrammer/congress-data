Expresses the disagreement of the House with the decision of a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the case of Murray et al v. Buchanan et al, which determined that congressional chaplaincies are unconstitutional. Directs the counsel representing the Speaker and Chaplain of the House, in petitioning for a hearing en banc before the full Court of Appeals, to present the concerns of the House in moving for a dismissal of the suit and in any other proceedings relative to such matter."
