Supports the President's objective of attaining an agreement providing for verifiable, equitable, and militarily significant reductions in strategic offensive arms. Declares that such agreement should provide initially for sharply reduced and equal levels on the total number of nuclear delivery systems and of warheads on these systems. Declares that the United States shall continue to refrain from undercutting the SALT I and SALT II agreements if the Soviet Union shows equal restraint. Declares that the United States should also propose to the Soviet Union and other nations practical measures to: (1) reduce the danger of nuclear war through accident or miscalculation; (2) prevent the use of nuclear weapons by third parties; (3) cooperate more closely to halt the worldwide proliferation of nuclear weapons; and (4) involve all nations possessing nuclear weapons in the arms control process. Urges the President to finish reviewing and to report on the pending Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Declares that the United States should continue to seek the elimination of all nuclear weapons."
