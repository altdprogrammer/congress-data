Requires the use of any surplus to reduce the public debt. Allows the limit on total outlays to be changed by a three-fourths vote of both Houses of Congress, or by a two-thirds vote in the case of an emergency declared by the President. Prohibits the Congress from requiring or authorizing any department, agency, or instrumentality of the government to require that a State or local government, in order to qualify for any program of the United States Government, engage in additional or expanded activities unless such State or local government is compensated for the costs incurred."
