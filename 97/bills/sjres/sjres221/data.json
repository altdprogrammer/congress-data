    "text": "Federal Motor Vehicle Expenditure Control Act of 1982 - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to direct the head of each executive agency, with specified exceptions, to: (1) designate an office or employee to operate a central monitoring system for the oversight of agency motor vehicle operations; and (2) develop a system to collect data on the costs to the agency of operating motor vehicles. Requires each agency to include with its request for FY 1984 appropriations a statement: (1) specifying its total motor vehicle acquisition, maintenance, leasing, and operating costs incurred in FY 1982 and estimated for FY 1983 and 1984; and (2) describing why its motor vehicle requirements cannot be met through the Interagency Motor Pool System. Directs the President to include an analysis of such statements with the FY 1984 budget transmitted to Congress. Requires the Director to direct agency heads to: (1) review the possibilities of consolidating motor vehicle facilities within and among agencies and to consolidate such facilities when consolidation would be cost-effective; (2) explore the feasibility of interagency consolidation of motor vehicle leasing requirements; and (3) reduce nontactical motor vehicle operation, maintenance, leasing, and acquisition activities in FY 1983 to reduce the total amount expended for such activities by all agencies to a specified amount below the total estimated expenditures for such fiscal year. Requires the Administrator of General Services to reduce motor vehicle storage and disposal costs. Requires the Director, the Administrator, and the Comptroller General to report to Congress on activities under this Act."
