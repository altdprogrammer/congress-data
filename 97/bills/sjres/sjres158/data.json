Rept. 97-470) Reaffirms the determination of the United States to: (1) prevent in Cuba the stationing of Soviet nuclear weapons or the development or the acquisition of any externally supported military capability endangering U.S. security; (2) resist Cuban efforts to extend its ideology or political system in the hemisphere by force or the threat of force; (3) pursue any diplomatic opportunity with a reasonable prospect of leading to the reduction of aggressive or subversive activities by Cuba or any other state in the hemisphere; and (4) work through the Organization of American States to achieve peaceful and democratic self-determination in Cuba and in all states in the hemisphere. Declares that it shall be U.S. policy to: (1) encourage all parties to the Salvadoran conflict to begin good-faith negotiations to end the hostilities; (2) support the efforts of other countries in the region to facilitate such negotiations; and (3) provide appropriate assistance to El Salvador in accordance with the section of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 requiring a Presidential certification of conditions in El Salvador. States that this resolution does not constitute the specific statutory authorization for the introduction of U.S. armed forces contemplated in the War Powers Resolution."
