Requires the use of any surplus to reduce the public debt. Allows the limit on total outlays to be changed by a three-fourths vote of both Houses of Congress, or by a two-thirds vote in the case of an emergency declared by the President. Prohibits the Congress from requiring or authorizing any agency of the government to require that a State or local government engage in additional or expanded activities unless such State or local government is compensated for the costs incurred."
