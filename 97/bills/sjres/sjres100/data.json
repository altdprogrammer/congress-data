Directs the President to give Congress specified information about the other countries providing military personnel for the MFO before the President assigns U.S. military personnel to the MFO. Requires every possible effort to be made to ensure that at least four foreign countries are represented on the MFO. Authorizes U.S. military and civilian personnel assigned to the MFO to perform only the functions specified in the peace treaty and its protocol. Limits the number of such military personnel. Authorizes the President to assign U.S. civilian personnel as observers in the MFO. Limits the U.S. share of the costs of the MFO. Authorizes appropriations to pay the U.S. contribution to the MFO budget. Authorizes Federal agencies to provide support to the MFO, without reimbursement if such support would not significantly increase U.S. costs. Authorizes the President to provide military training to the armed forces of other countries participating in the MFO. Directs the President to report annually to Congress on the MFO, on U.S. participation in the MFO, and on specified discussions with Egypt and Israel. Requires such reports to be as detailed as possible. States that nothing in this resolution is intended to signify congressional approval of any agreement made by the executive branch other than the agreement to participate in the MFO. States that nothing in this resolution shall affect the responsibilities of the President or the Congress under the War Powers Resolution."
