    "text": "Makes supplemental appropriations to the Department of Labor. Appropriates to the Department a sum equal to five percent of the latest estimated cost to the Government of unemployment compensation for the current fiscal year, to remain available until December 31, 1982. Requires that, of such sum: (1) 85 percent shall be available to provide productive jobs for unemployed individuals; and (2) 15 percent shall be available for the Department's youth and training programs. Prohibits individuals assisted with funds under this Act from being: (1) eligible for unemployment compensation during the period of productive job employment; or (2) paid except upon written certification by the supervisor that such job was performed. Sets forth requirements for individual eligibility, wage rates, and employment benefits and conditions with respect to such jobs. Prohibits any displacement of currently employed workers by individuals employed with funds under this Act. Limits the percentage of funds which may be used for administration and equipment costs. Permits funds to be used to provide unemployed individuals with temporary employment for not more than six months in repair, maintenance, and rehabilitation of public facilities and conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement of public lands. Sets forth provisions for allocation of such funds. Allocates 83 percent of such funds among eligible entities with unemployment above the national average rate for the preceding three months. Provides that 50 percent of such allocation shall be based on the relative number of unemployed, 25 percent on the number of unemployed living in areas of substantial unemployment, and 25 percent on the number of unemployed in excess of four and one-half percent of the labor force. Allocates two percent of such funds among Native American tribes, bands, and groups. Allocates the remainder to specified entities to serve localities which have had: (1) a large scale loss of jobs caused by the closing of a facility, mass layoffs, natural disasters, or similar circumstances; or (2) a sudden or severe economic dislocation. Sets forth requirements for eligible entities, including States, local governments, and rural area concentrated employment program grantees. Directs the Secretary of Labor, within 30 days after enactment of this Act, to: (1) notify recipients of the allocation of funds; and (2) promulgate necessary rules and regulations to carry out this Act."
