Prohibits the Congress from passing and the President from signing any appropriation bill which would cause the total expenditures of the Federal Government to exceed its total receipts in any fiscal year. Permits enactment of defense appropriation bills, by majority vote, which would cause the total expenditures for the year to exceed the budgeted expenditures if the Congress first approves a resolution declaring a condition of military urgency. Permits the Congress to waive such provisions with respect to any single year in which a declaration of war is in effect. Prohibits any annual increase in the proportion of Federal receipts to the national income unless passed by a roll call vote, directed solely to such purpose, of each House of Congress."
