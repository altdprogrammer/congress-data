Prohibits the referral of legislative measures to such committee and prohibits the committee from reporting any recommendation, except upon a separate majority vote of each House. Directs the committee to make an annual audit of the expenditures of the legislative branch and to report such audit to the Congress together with an annual report on the state of the legislative branch. Authorizes the committee to hold hearings and issue subpenas, to procure personnel (limited to 12 full-time professional and six full-time clerical staff), and to reimburse its members and staff for travel expenses incurred outside the District of Columbia. Sets forth the rules and procedures for such committee. Abolishes the Joint Committee on the Library and the Joint Committee on Printing and transfers their functions to the Joint Committee on the Legislative Branch."
