Requires such joint resolution to be approved by the President. Permits the total expenditures during any such fiscal year to exceed the total revenue as projected by Congress by two percent. Requires any deficit to be extinguished by the end of the fifth fiscal year after the fiscal year in which such deficit occurred.
