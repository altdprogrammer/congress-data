Declares that any deficit approved pursuant to this article shall be considered money expended by the United States for the first following fiscal year. Requires Congress to provide for a corresponding increase in the level of total revenues if the amount of such deficit exceeds two percent of the level of total expenditures. Prohibits the amount of the debt of the United States from exceeding the amount of such debt on the date of adoption of this article."
