Directs the Secretary of the Interior to order substantial lease offerings within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska to begin immediately for private development only. Exempts any such lease from the environmental impact statement requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Directs the President to give leasing priority to the areas of Outer Continental Shelf that have the highest hydrocarbon potential and known hydrocarbon reserves. Directs the President to appoint the advisory panel necessary to carry out this Act. Sets forth provisions relating to panel members and their appointment. Requires the agencies involved with the implementation of this Act to annually report to Congress, providing the following minimum information: (1) the reasonableness of restrictions; (2) legislative or administrative recommendations; and (3) agency efforts to reduce constraints to leasing."
