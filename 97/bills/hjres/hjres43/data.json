States that if the inflation rate exceeds three percent annually the increase in total outlays shall be reduced by one-fourth the difference between the inflation rate and three percent. Requires the use of any surplus in total revenues received by the Government to reduce the public debt. Allows the limit on total outlays to be changed: (1) by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress to meet an emergency declared by the President; or (2) by a three-quarters vote on other occasions. Continues Federal aid programs to States and local governments for a period of six years. Prohibits Congress from authorizing any United States agency from requiring that a State or local government engage in additional or expanded activities without compensation equal to the additional costs."
