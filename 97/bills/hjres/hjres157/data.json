Requires Congress, if actual revenue is less than the total outlay during such fiscal year, to provide for the dissolution of the difference within the next two succeeding fiscal years. Provides for a waiver of such requirements only when Congress determines by a two-thirds vote of both Houses within 21 days of each other that a national emergency exists of an economic or a defense nature."
