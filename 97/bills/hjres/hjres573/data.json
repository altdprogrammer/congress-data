    "text": "States that the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) between the United States and the Soviet Union should have the following objectives: (1) pursuing a complete halt to the nuclear arms race; (2) deciding when and how to achieve and pursue a mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing, production, and further deployment of nuclear warheads, missiles, and other delivery systems; (3) giving special attention to destabilizing weapons; (4) providing for cooperative measures of verification, including on-site inspection; (5) pursuing substantial, equitable, and verifiable reductions; (6) preserving present limitations and controls on current nuclear weapons and delivery systems; and (7) incorporating ongoing negotiations in Geneva on land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles into the START negotiations. Declares that the United States shall try to reach a common position with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies on any agreement that would be inconsistent with existing U.S. commitments to those allies. Declares that the United States shall continue to adhere to the SALT II agreement so long as the Soviet Union adheres to it and so long as it is in the national interest to adhere to it. Declares that the United States may take advantage of concurrent and complementary arms control proposals."
