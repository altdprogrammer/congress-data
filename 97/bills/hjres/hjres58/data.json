States that if the inflation rate exceeds three percent annually the increase in total outlays shall be reduced by one-fourth the difference between the inflation rate and three percent. Requires the use of any surplus in total revenues received by the Government to reduce the public debt. Allows the limit on total outlays to be changed by a three-quarters vote of both Houses of Congress, or by a two-thirds vote in the case of an emergency declared by the President. Continues Federal aid programs to States and local governments for a period of six years."
