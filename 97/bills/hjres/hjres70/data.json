    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Requires official candidates of political parties for President to be nominated in a closed primary election by direct popular vote. Restricts candidates to the primaries of the parties with which they are respectively affiliated. Directs that a candidate be placed on the appropriate party's ballot in all States if such individual files with the President of the Senate before a certain date a petition signed by a specified number of qualified voters in a specified number of jurisdictions. Recognizes as a political party for purposes of such amendment any party which received at least ten percent of the votes cast for all electors for candidates for President and Vice President in the most recent Presidential election. Sets the date of the primary election as the second Saturday after the first Monday in July in the year preceding the expiration of the regular term of President and Vice President, unless Congress directs otherwise. Designates the person receiving the greatest number votes in the primary as the official party candidate if such votes total at least 40 percent of those cast. Requires a runoff election between the two persons receiving the greatest number of votes in the event that no candidate receives such a plurality. Directs each party to nominate a person who is eligible for nomination as Vice President not less than seven nor more than 30 days after selection of that party's Presidential candidate. Designates a party's Vice Presidential candidate as its Presidential candidate if the Presidential nominee dies, resigns, or is disqualified. Prescribes that a committee composed of party nominees for the House of Representatives shall select party candidates if both the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates die, resign, or are disqualified."
