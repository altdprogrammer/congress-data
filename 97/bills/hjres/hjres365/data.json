Directs the President and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to undertake immediately: (1) an aggressive campaign designed to encourage banks to cease providing loans or lines of credit for unproductive takeovers and speculative purposes; (2) efforts to ensure access to the least expensive possible credit; and (3) studies to explore and report to the Congress on innovative techniques for managing the money supply and credit resources in times of tight credit. Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to reconsider its tentative decision to reduce the targets for monetary growth for 1982. Directs the President to nominate individuals for vacancies on the Board of Governors so that this Nation's agricultural and commercial interests, including housing and small businesses, will no longer be underrepresented on the Board."
