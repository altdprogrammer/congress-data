Declares that the United States, pending restoration of fair and equitable trading conditions under the GATT, should try to prevent further erosion of farm exports and try to regain a foreign market share commensurate with the competitive market advantage of the U.S. farmer. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should make available the funds necessary to assist exports and counteract foreign unfair trading practices. Declares that restoring U.S. farm export competitiveness will help create jobs and raise net farm income."
